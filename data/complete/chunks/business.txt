Fred Ruckel

Nearly three years later, Ruckel’s experience hits at the core of a sweeping antitrust lawsuit filed last week by the Federal Trade Commission against Amazon. The agency accused Amazon of wielding its monopoly power to squeeze merchants and thwart rivals. For consumers, that’s led to artificially inflated prices and a degraded shopping experience, the agency alleges. In the 172-page suit, the FTC said Amazon relies on an “anti-discounting strategy” and a “massive web-crawling apparatus that constantly tracks online prices” to stifle competition

The agency said Amazon punishes third-party sellers who offer cheaper products elsewhere by threatening to disqualify them from appearing in the buy box if it detects a lower price. Losing the buy box is an “existential threat” to sellers’ businesses, the complaint alleges. The end result of these tactics, the FTC argues, is elevated prices across the web. The company steadily hikes the fees it charges sellers and prevents them from discounting on other sites, so sellers often inflate their prices off of Amazon, creating an “artificial price floor everywhere,” according to the complaint

The FTC is seeking to hold Amazon liable for allegedly violating anti-monopoly law, though it has not yet outlined the specific remedies it believes would best resolve its concerns. In antitrust cases, remedies are often determined only after a court finds the defendant liable. In a blog post, Amazon general counsel David Zapolsky said third-party sellers set their own prices on the marketplace. The company also invests in tools to help sellers offer “competitive prices,” he said. “Even with those tools, some of the businesses selling on Amazon might still choose to set prices that aren’t competitive,” Zapolsky said. “Just like any store owner who wouldn’t want to promote a bad deal to their customers, we don’t highlight or promote offers that are not competitively priced. ” Zapolsky argued the FTC’s lawsuit could force it to stop highlighting low prices, “a perverse result that would be directly opposed to the goals of antitrust law. ”

Concerns over Amazon pricing policies, fees

Many sellers have zeroed in on Amazon’s pricing policies and rising fees as rightful areas of concern in the FTC's lawsuit. Molson Hart, whose company Viahart sells toys on Amazon, has been a longtime critic of Amazon’s pricing policies. Hart complained of how Amazon’s seller fees impact pricing in a 2019 Medium post and later that year testified about his experience before a House committee. Hart said Amazon sales comprise about 90% of his business, meaning any hit those sales take on Amazon has a considerable impact

All have fought for a piece of the business – which one day could be worth trillions of dollars – and the power to shape it. At the heart of this competition is a brain-stretching paradox. The people who say they are most worried about AI are among the most determined to create it and enjoy its riches. They have justified their ambition with their strong belief that they alone can keep AI from endangering Earth. Musk and Page stopped speaking soon after the party that summer

A few weeks later, Musk dined with Altman, who was then running a tech incubator, and several researchers in a private room at the Rosewood hotel in Menlo Park, California, a favoured deal-making spot close to the venture capital offices of Sand Hill Road. That dinner led to the creation of a startup called OpenAI later in the year. Backed by hundreds of millions of dollars from Musk and other funders, the lab promised to protect the world from Page’s vision

Rebel board members tried to force out Altman because, they believed, they could no longer trust him to build AI that would benefit humanity. Over five chaotic days, OpenAI looked as if it were going to fall apart, until the board – pressured by giant investors and employees who threatened to follow Altman out the door – backed down.

Hassabis replied that the plan would work – so long as superintelligent machines didn’t follow and destroy humanity on Mars, too. Musk was speechless. He hadn’t thought about that particular danger. Musk soon invested in DeepMind alongside Thiel, so he could be closer to the creation of this technology. Flush with cash, DeepMind hired researchers who specialised in neural networks, complex algorithms created in the image of the human brain. A neural network is essentially a giant mathematical system that spends days, weeks or even months identifying patterns in large amounts of digital data

The next day, Hinton ran the auction from his hotel room. Because of an old back injury, he rarely sat down. He turned a trash can upside down on a table, put his laptop on top and watched the bids roll in over the next two days. Google made an offer. So did Microsoft. DeepMind quickly bowed out as the price went up. The industry giants pushed the bids to $US20 million and then $US25 million, according to documents detailing the auction. As the price passed $US30 million, Microsoft quit, but it rejoined the bidding at $US37 million. “We felt like we were in a movie,” Hinton said. Then Microsoft dropped out a second time. Only Baidu and Google were left, and they pushed the bidding to $US42 million, $US43 million. Finally, at $US44 million, Hinton and his students stopped the auction. The bids were still climbing, but they wanted to work for Google. And the money was staggering.

When Musk invested in DeepMind, he broke his own informal rule – that he would not invest in any company he didn’t run himself. The downsides of his decision were already apparent when, only a month or so after his birthday spat with Page, he again found himself face to face with his former friend and fellow billionaire. Larry Page, co-founder of Google. Credit: Bloomberg The occasion was the first meeting of DeepMind’s ethics board, on August 14, 2015. The board had been set up at the insistence of the startup’s founders to ensure that their technology did no harm after the sale. The members convened in a conference room just outside Musk’s office at SpaceX. But that’s where Musk’s control ended. When Google bought DeepMind, it bought the whole thing. Musk was out. Financially, he had come out ahead, but he was unhappy. Three Google executives now firmly in control of DeepMind were there: Page; Sergey Brin, a Google co-founder and Tesla investor; and Eric Schmidt, Google’s chair

(Sutskever was one of the graduate students Google “bought” in Hinton’s auction. ) Initially, Musk wanted to operate OpenAI as a nonprofit, free from the economic incentives that were driving Google and other corporations. But by the time Google wowed the tech community with its Go stunt, Musk was changing his mind about how it should be run. He desperately wanted OpenAI to invent something that would capture the world’s imagination and close the gap with Google, but it wasn’t getting the job done as a nonprofit

In late 2017, Musk hatched a plan to wrest control of the lab from Altman and the other founders and transform it into a commercial operation that would join forces with Tesla and rely on supercomputers the car company was developing, according to four people familiar with the matter. When Altman and others pushed back, Musk quit and said he would focus on his own AI work at Tesla. In February 2018, he announced his departure to OpenAI’s staff on the top floor of the startup’s offices in a converted truck factory, three people who attended the meeting said

Altman flew to Sun Valley for a conference and ran into Satya Nadella, Microsoft’s CEO. A tie-up seemed natural. Altman knew Microsoft’s chief technology officer, Kevin Scott. Microsoft had bought LinkedIn from Hoffman, an OpenAI board member. Nadella told Scott to get it done. The deal closed in 2019

Altman and OpenAI had formed a for-profit company under the original nonprofit, they had $US1 billion in fresh capital, and Microsoft had a new way to build AI into its vast cloud computing service. Not everyone inside OpenAI was happy. Dario Amodei, a researcher with ties to the effective altruist community, had been on hand at the Rosewood hotel when OpenAI was born. Amodei, who endlessly twisted his curls between his fingers as he talked, was leading the lab’s efforts to build a neural network called a large language model that could learn from enormous amounts of digital text

Benchmark US crude fell $US5. 01 to settle at $US84. 22 per barrel for its worst drop in just over a year. It’s been pulling back since, topping $US93 last week. Brent crude, the international standard, lost $US5. 11 to $US85. 81. Loading Prices for crude had been generally charging higher from $US70 during the summer, following announcements of cuts to production by some oil-producing countries.

The unprecedented move to remove a speaker from the position likely doesn’t change much in the short term, with funding for the US government set until November 17. “That said, a leadership vacuum in the House raises the odds of a government shutdown when the current funding extension expires,” according to economists at Goldman Sachs. A shutdown would drag on the US economy, raising the risk of a recession, though financial markets have held up relatively well through past shutdowns.

Quote of the day “Last year, Christmas spending was bolstered by a record freedom spending phenomenon with delayed overseas travel, whereas this year shoppers are expected to be much more conservative with their budgets,” said Australian Retailers Association chief Paul Zahra as cost-of-living pressures put a lid on spending, with shoppers tipped to cut back on hospitality, home goods and clothes purchases.

Is Sam Bankman-Fried a bad ‘man’ or a good ‘boy’? Lawyers swap opening statements before first witnesses take the stand

Who is Sam Bankman-Fried, the former CEO of crypto exchange FTX? Is he a liar and a fraud? Or did he act in good faith, and like many a startup founder, fly too close to the sun?

That answer ultimately lies with the jury, which was selected on Wednesday morning before lawyers for the government and then Bankman-Fried swapped two very different stories of the former crypto mogul’s sudden rise and almost instantaneous fall

“One year ago, it looked like the defendant was on the top of the world,” began Thane Rehn, a prosecutor for the government, in his opening statement. The former CEO of FTX oversaw a supposedly thriving crypto exchange, jetted between international locales, and hobnobbed with celebrities like Tom Brady and Larry David. He repeatedly emphasized to customers that their money was safe and secure. But “all of that, all of it, was built on lies,” Rehn declared to the jury. “Behind the curtains, he was not what he appeared to be

” What followed was a roughly 30-minute story that repeatedly emphasized how Bankman-Fried allegedly stole customer funds to facilitate his jet-setting lifestyle, donate millions to political candidates, and finance risky bets. The key to his alleged scheme? Alameda Research, a crypto hedge fund he also owned, argued Rehn. Using Caroline Ellison, his on-again off-again girlfriend and the CEO of Alameda, as a front, Bankman-Fried had “secret access” to customer money—both cash and crypto—the government claimed. Moreover, Bankman-Fried allegedly directed employees to conceal the flow of money into FTX’s coffers and forged financial documents distributed to lenders and investors

“The defendant lied to the world,” Rehn alleged. And who was this defendant? Not a crypto “boy” genius, as so many in the media (Fortune included) have written, but a “man” who “stole billions of dollars from thousands of victims,” Rehn said. “You will see the full picture. ”

…or a well-meaning founder?

But Bankman-Fried, whose cheekbones were more prominent after spending about seven weeks in a Brooklyn prison, was no liar, according to Mark Cohen, one of his lawyers. “Sam didn’t defraud anyone,” he said early on in his opening statement

What the jury will see is a nerdy startup founder who acted in “good faith,” not the prosecution’s “cartoon of a villain. ” (Cohen repeatedly harped on Bankman-Fried’s allegedly good-faith actions throughout his address to the jury. )

Alameda was not subterranean or shady. It was a successful hedge fund, he said. FTX was no Ponzi scheme. It was a “very innovative, successful company

” And the business practices between the two were reasonable, he argued, claiming that Alameda acted legally as an FTX customer, payment processor, and market maker, or financial entity that acts as a trading partner for customers looking to buy and sell cryptocurrencies.

In fact, he specifically pointed the finger at Ellison, the former CEO of Alameda, who, he said, did not adequately protect her hedge fund from the inherent risk of the crypto markets. When the walls came closing in and the aforementioned plane approached the “eye of the storm,” Bankman-Fried did not act like someone who was guilty. Rather, he was willing to give up his personal wealth to make customers whole, Cohen argued. “In the end, Sam started and built two billion-dollar businesses,” he concluded. “He didn’t steal any money

A Frenchman who lives in London testifies in New York

After lawyers from both sides depicted two very different Bankman-Frieds, the prosecution called its first two witnesses to the stand—and they weren’t blockbuster names or former lieutenants-turned-government-cooperators, like Ellison. The first was a victim: Marc-Antoine Julliard, a Paris-born cocoa trader who lives in London. In 2021, Julliard, who had coiffed hair and spoke with a strong French accent, decided to invest in crypto and landed on FTX as his exchange of choice, where he traded cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Dogecoin.

Why did he make such a deal with the government, she asked. “I was concerned that I had unwittingly written code that contributed to a crime,” he said. Soon, however, the clock neared 4:30 p

Psagot worth 80% less since Rani Zim bought it

In late August 2021, Rani Zim completed one of the more surprising moves in his meteoric business career when he bought Psagot Investment House for NIS 405 million from Altshuler Shaham. Before that acquisition, Zim had made his fortune in food retailing, setting up, together with his brother Adi, the Kimat Hinam supermarket chain, which was sold in an impressive exit, and in income producing real estate, with the commercial centers company that bears his name

But just over two years since the deal that was meant to move him up a league, Group Psagot for Finance and Investments (TASE: GPST), which holds the investment house that was once the biggest in Israel, has a market cap of just NIS 97 million, after a 75% decline in its share price in the past year, and an 80% since the acquisition.

"Since he bought Psagot, three significant things happened that affected the company. First of all, interest rates rose, and if there’s one thing that a financial marker doesn’t like, it’s interest rate hikes, particularly in the case of a leveraged deal. "

To finance the acquisition, Zim took a loan of NIS 255 million from Mizrahi Tefahot Bank, which he offloaded onto the acquired investment house. NIS 120 million is still outstanding

"A second factor," the source continued, "is the judicial overhaul promoted by the government in the first nine months of the year, which didn’t exactly contribute to the financial markets, with a great deal of money leaving Israel. Psagot doesn’t specialize in long-term savings, in which most of the money is invested outside Israel, but mainly in investment in the local market, in products such as portfolio management, mutual funds, and a little brokerage. These are investment channels that are very vulnerable when Israel takes a hit

Finally, the war that broke out on October 7 was a blow to the finance industry, certainly in the short term. "

Now, Group Psagot is setting out to raise NIS 220 million debt, to be secured by the company’s shares in subsidiary Psagot Investment House. To that end, the company’s management has held meetings in the past few days with several financial institutions, to present to them the investment house’s activities and business plans

The sum that Group Psagot seeks to raise is intended both to cover the balance of its debt to Mizrahi Tefahot Bank, and to replace NIS 120 million in marketable bonds due for redemption in the coming eighteen months. The existing bonds (series C) are currently traded at junk yields of around 16%, which makes it difficult to recycle the debt, hence the collateral required for the bonds to be offered. Group Psagot believes that, once the move is completed, the yield on its bonds will fall to single-digit proportions, and that its share price will rise accordingly

"A rapid realization that it’s not for him"

So far, Zim has invested nearly NIS 130 million of his own capital in buying control of Psagot, including in a rights issue that the group made last summer. The 62% stake that Zim holds in Group Psagot, the public company (formerly called Value Capital) through which he bought the investment house, is currently worth just NIS 64 million, meaning that he lost about half his investment within a short time

Immediately after acquiring Psagot’s business (which mainly consisted of management of mutual funds and customer portfolios) Zim told "Globes": "Our headline at Psagot is to restore its former glory. We haven’t come to make a killing in one or two years, and I don’t want to start selling the business on to other entities… we’ll invest in the people, in the activity, in the organization, in the market, and we’ll form collaborations with many entities in the economy.

But, as reported six months ago, Zim has started to look for someone to buy his entire stake in the investment house, or at least part of it. One of the names mentioned in the press is that of Group Psagot CEO Yaniv Bender, who currently holds 7. 4% of the company, as someone who could participate in such an acquisition.

The sale of the mutual funds will yield a gain to Psagot of NIS 90 million, which will be posted in it fourth quarter financials.

But in the light of the current share price, and since market conditions in Israel in general indicate that it will be hard to find a buyer who wants to do a deal at this time, it’s not certain that a deal is in the offing.

Israel's defense undone by reliance on technology

The Berlin Wall was built in 1961 as a standard wire and concrete fence to make it difficult for East German residents to escape to freedom in the West. By the end of the 1970s, its fourth generation already included a 127 km long electrified fence, a strip of land made of sharp metal nails, a closely-packed row of watchtowers, a patrol road, an intrusion-tracking dirt road, guard dogs, deep trenches anti-vehicle trenches, and two layers of concrete walls

The fence that, until October 7, separated Israel and the Gaza Strip was completed in December 2021, 60 years after construction of the Berlin Wall began. It was intended to protect against a major security threat, but in practice it was much leaner than that. The fence was almost unmanned by soldiers, and relied mainly on sensors, above and below ground, surveillance cameras, and vehicle patrols. And, of course, there was no surrounding minefield

After Operation Protective Edge in 2014 revealed that Hamas forces were able to penetrate the Gaza border settlements at several points via underground tunnels, it was decided in 2016 to build a defense line focused on this threat called "the anti-tunnel barrier" that would replace the existing fence. The upper section of the barrier was based mainly on a fence called the "sand clock," which had only proved itself in stopping illegal immigrants on the Israel-Egypt border - the same fence that then-US President Donald Trump enthused over, and wanted to duplicate on the US southern border

The cost of the barriers was NIS 3. 5 billion, mostly for the below-ground section.

On the morning of Saturday, October 7, the above-ground section of the barrier turned out to be completely insubstantial, as was its fundamental concept of defense. Using drones easily purchased on the Internet, Hamas disabled both the cameras transmitting images to control room monitors in real time, and the (See and Fire) long distance stationary remote controlled weapon stations (RCWS). There had been a second line of defense, observation balloons, but for unknown reasons, all three had stopped working some weeks before the attack, and repairs were postponed until "after the holidays

After the Yom Kippur War, Israel pulled strongly in the direction of building military technological superiority, and this integrated well with the Israeli economy, which was gradually opening up to the world, and the computer revolution. This effort bore fruit as early as 1982, when we proved to the whole world that we could destroy most of the Syrian surface-to-air missile array using precision-guided weaponry. Israel's security concept was updated by Dan Meridor and Lt. Col

At the West Point or Annapolis military academies, it's customary to teach technological subjects as well, because they understand that the military profession today requires a basic understanding of the field. The correct way to integrate technology with security is to implement it as part of an operational concept, not as a single component, and to assume that it is not perfect, but has vulnerabilities, and may suffer from system failures. Therefore, such systems always need what’s known as 'redundancy', i. e. backup systems, to make sure there isn’t a single point of vulnerability through which everything could collapse

The Iron Dome paradox

Perhaps more than anything else, the Iron Dome system is representative as the technological response to the threat from Gaza. Matania explains, "The Iron Dome was built with the strategic vision of giving decision-makers breathing room, to allow them not to react immediately to the rockets, but to have the flexibility to react at the right time, and in the right place, in a range of ways

--- Chunk ---
But some say its success was paradoxical. Iron Dome was so successful it not only supported the decision-making process but fundamentally changed it. Up until October 7, it served as a very successful plaster to threats to a sovereign state, because what legitimacy would a state leader have for going to war when no citizens were harmed?"

Brigadier General Eran Ortal, until recently the commander of The Dado Center for Interdisciplinary Military Studies, a military research center subordinate to the Operations Directorate, also believes that various technological measures such as the Iron Dome, and the barrier, influenced decision-making in Israel

--- Chunk ---
In his estimation, these helped the political echelon conduct a policy of military restraint towards the Gaza Strip, which in turn allowed Hamas to strengthen and gain offensive capabilities. In an article five years ago, Ortal, currently in active military service an unavailable for interview, wrote, "Israeli restraint as regards proactive thwarting of offensive capabilities in the Gaza Strip stems from a clear Israeli strategy that strives to reduce the influence of the enemy on the current routine of life in Israel, even at the price of worsening of the threat in the future

" Ortal pointed out that this policy was natural and that "a Western nation cannot lead its life in an endless state of emergency. But alongside the understanding of the need for a containment policy, it must be recognized that the risks are high, as evidenced by the steeply worsening intensity of conflicts between Israel and the terrorist organizations in Gaza

"

According to Ortal, in recent decades, Hamas and Hezbollah developed ballistic missiles and terror tunnels in response to Israeli policy that sought minimal friction with the enemy through separation and withdrawal from the security zone in southern Lebanon, and the Gaza Strip. Ortal points out that between Operation Pillar of Defense in 2012 and Operation Protective Edge in 2014, Israel significantly reduced targeted countermeasures against terrorist operatives, and none focused on Hamas operatives

--- Chunk ---
According to his analysis, this was because, prior to the Iron Dome coming into use in 2011, the most dangerous threat posed by Gaza developed in the period preceding Operation Protective Edge. The understandings that Israel reached with Hamas in 2012 were made "to stop the fighting", Ortal says, and to get life back to normal as quickly as possible. This, after air raid sirens sounded in Tel Aviv and Jerusalem for the first time since the Yom Kippur War, and the education system shut down for more than a week

--- Chunk ---
Even after Iron Dome, Israel found it difficult to stand up against the significant disruption of daily life on the home front. "Despite the clear threat posed by Gaza, the decision makers preferred to avoid a policy that would mean returning a large part of the country's population to the reality of air raids and disrupted daily routines

--- Chunk ---
The bottom line: the Iron Dome did not change the essential strategic situation; as firepower from the Gaza Strip developed, so did the terrorist organizations’ ability to control daily life in Israel’s hinterland, hold it hostage, and restrain Israel from taking proactive measures against them. "

"Why didn't the relative success of the Iron Dome translate into the even more important strategic achievement of restoring Israel's freedom of action against Hamas in the Strip?" asks Ortal rhetorically, and names several factors. "The first, like any other operational system, Iron Dome is also not perfect

--- Chunk ---
The enemy studies it and develops its own challenges against it, and the decision makers recognized the fact that the State of Israel is not hermetically protected. Second, the enormous cost involved in deploying and operating [Iron Dome] batteries significantly impedes a policy based on continuous rounds of violence. Thirdly, as long as the rockets are intercepted in the skies over Israel, and not the skies over Gaza, the Israeli home front is forced to experience sirens, security rooms and shelters, and disrupted routine living

In other words, even the complete success of the Iron Dome left daily life on the home front in the hands of the terrorist organizations. "

On Saturday, October 7, for example, suspicious movement in Gaza convinced the Shin Bet head to send a special team to the southern border, but he was unable to convince the top IDF echelons to prepare accordingly. To handle those weak signals, Eiland claims, one must use "scenario theory", meaning, taking into account scenarios that have a low probability of occurring, but with devastating results should they occur, and the simple way to prepare for them. Eiland explains: "You detect certain noises on Friday night, but conclude that the probability of an attack is low, let's say only 10%

Those who act only on the probability do not consider the question: if this attack happens - will you be able to live with yourself for eliminating this threat? There’s also a third consideration, which is ease of effort: what is the effort required of me to prepare for this unlikely but dangerous scenario? It may be a relatively simple effort, like waking the troops up at 4:00 am, placing them position, and putting an aircraft in the air for a few hours. You don’t even need pilots - unmanned aircraft operators are enough

There’s no need to mobilize reserves or convene a cabinet. Every commander is allowed to give instructions to those under him - if that would have happened, everything would be different.

About 45% of our audience attends the Festival from North America, 13% from Europe and Asia and about 12% come from African countries outside of Ghana and South Africa. Can you tell us more about the Rising Star Challenge?

Our annual ‘Rising Star Challenge’ is one of our flagship competitions for unsigned and emerging artists in Africa. The ‘Rising Star Challenge’ is our way of supporting live music not only in Ghana, but throughout Africa. To enter into the contest, artists upload an original song to Audiomack and create an Instagram Reel that includes an introduction about the artist, their approach to music and the music-making process, and what they want their potential audience to know about their style of music. As an exciting lead-up to the festival, 10 musicians are chosen from a shortlist of 25 unsigned and emerging artists

From there, five finalists are chosen to perform on AfroFuture’s Rising Star Stage alongside the festival’s headliners. “Our annual ‘Rising Star Challenge’ is one of our flagship competitions for unsigned and emerging artists in Africa. ”

For the grand finale, one artist from the “Rising Star Challenge” is selected for the ultimate prize – an exclusive recording agreement with Sony Music Africa for a single release. In addition, winners receive global distribution for their new single, marketing support such as a music video and more, free access to AfroFuture’s recording studio and mentoring and training from industry executives and leading musicians and producers. In 2022, we took things up a notch by introducing an expansion to the “Rising Star Challenge” with the addition of the “Rising Star DJ Challenge,” a call for DJs from across the diaspora to share their talents with our audience and to have the chance to grace the stage at our AfroFuture festival

As one of the flagship events hosted in Ghana, we had the exciting challenge of bringing 20,000 visitors to the country and establishing Ghana as the premier destination for all travelers worldwide. What are your ambitions for AfroFuture over the coming years?

We’re seeking to continue to strengthen our narrative within our primary pillars of food, art, fashion, and music as well as striving towards a united diaspora. Our future is bright and is currently manifesting itself through our extended global activities like ‘Road to AfroFuture. ’

As we previously shared, in 2022, we launched our ‘Road to AfroFuture’ experiential popup activation to catapult our brand into the Sub-Saharan market. Since the launch of this initiative in 2022, we’ve had the opportunity to expand our presence to the UK, South Africa, Côte d’Ivoire, and France. As we continue to gain momentum and garner more popularity around our “Road to Afrofuture” events, we’ll aim to explore additional locations and expand our reach to more diverse markets

What is the AfroFuture Foundation?

The AfroFuture Foundation is a program we established to give back to the local Ghanaian community in a long-term and meaningful way. Through our philanthropy efforts, we’re able to connect with local groups and international charities to educate and feed students and families in Accra. Our foundation goals are strategically aligned with the United Nations’ 17 sustainable development goals. In 2017, we had the opportunity to collaborate with local schools within Madina Zongo, Greater Accra, and Kumasi Ashanti Region, to provide $5,000 in school supplies (notebooks, pads, pencils, pens, erasers, textbooks) and bookbags

Treasury yields have been climbing sharply as Wall Street accepts a new normal where the Federal Reserve is likely to keep interest rates high for longer. The Fed is trying to push still-high inflation down to its target, and its main tool of high interest rates does that by trying to slow the economy and hurting prices for investments. The Fed’s main interest rate is at its highest level since 2001, and the central bank indicated last week it may cut interest rates next year by less than it earlier expected

Friday’s economic data shows that not only was inflation a touch cooler than expected in August, so was growth in spending by US consumers. That can be a positive for inflation because it means not as many dollars are pouring into purchases. That in turn could give companies less encouragement to try to raise prices further. But it may also dent what’s been a big driver keeping the US economy out of a recession

From Ten Hag’s future to a leaking roof: Ratcliffe’s Manchester United in-tray

The manager’s future

Erik ten Hag’s team are treading water at precisely the wrong moment: as Sir Jim Ratcliffe takes charge of Manchester United’s sporting department before making sweeping changes in the posts that will directly affect the manager. Richard Arnold has left despite officially staying until the end of the year and into his role may come Jean-Claude Blanc, the CEO of Ratcliffe’s Ineos Sport, as the man Ten Hag reports to

Ten Hag’s line manager may change too, as Ratcliffe considers whether a new football director is required, a position held by John Murtough. Ten Hag may have a first clue of his status in Ratcliffe’s new empire if he is sounded out for his view of a prime factor in his ability to coach and manage the side to success: United’s transfer policy. This leads us to Murtough …

Will Murtough survive?

The football director has no plans to depart but whether he remains in situ may be a matter for Ratcliffe

Some inside the club believe Murtough will either be moved sideways or follow Arnold through the exit door. Ratcliffe might have signalled his assessment of him when, during a March tour of the club, he questioned the signing of a 30-year-old Casemiro on a four‑year deal worth about £350,000 a week. Murtough, whose football department has a transfer veto, and Ten Hag, who has the same, were responsible for the Brazilian’s signing. The word is that Murtough, present when Ratcliffe raised this, was hardly impressed

Particularly as Nice, the French club owned by Ratcliffe, recruited Aaron Ramsey, Kasper Schmeichel and Ross Barkley as part of the nine signings in the same summer Casemiro joined United. Schmeichel was 35 and signed a three-year contract in a £1m transfer from Leicester; Ramsey, then 31, and Barkley, then 28, came on frees and were given one-year deals. All three players left Nice this summer. Newcastle’s sporting director, Dan Ashworth, and Paul Mitchell, Monaco’s sporting director until March, are among those mentioned in dispatches as a potential Murtough replacement

Can any CEO make United a best-in-class elite club again?

Blanc, who has an MBA from Harvard, is billed as the “Lionel Messi of business” by Nice’s chief executive, Fabrice Bocquet. At 60 years old Blanc has been the Juventus CEO and president, CEO at Paris Saint‑Germain and French Tennis, and the executive overseeing the Tour de France. But once he or whoever becomes Arnold’s successor is in place, it will dawn rapidly that United are a one-off hydra-headed beast of a club which is treacherously difficult to control

And there is this, too: across town Manchester City have accrued six championships since United’s last in 2013 and boast a commercial operation that leaves Ratcliffe’s new concern light years behind. Old Trafford (and the training ground)

To find an apt shorthand for the lurching ship that is United, end the search at the roof of their stadium where on Manchester’s (many) wet days rain leaks through. Old Trafford remains a storied venue but as it continues to crumble the tale of disrepair has become a central narrative in its recent history

As Premier League titles have become scarce (zero in a decade) the tale of neglect of a ground that dates to 1910 is emblematic of the Glazers’ quasi‑absentee proprietorship. Ratcliffe will invest $300m (£237m) into infrastructure but this is small beer when considering the multibillion-pound facelift or new venue required. There is also the cramped Carrington base: as on Sir Matt Busby Way, the footprint is large at the training ground but the configuration and facilities are ageing – badly

Communications

The Glazers treat a microphone or TV camera as United fans do Liverpool or Manchester City: as a fierce enemy. No family member has given a press conference or interview during their 18-year tenure. Ratcliffe has arrived on a ticket of, partly, being the local lad made good (Failsworth, where he was born, is next to Newton Heath, United’s birthplace) so if he proves as silent as the Americans then this will be: a) poor PR; and b) just plain poor

Football fans can be classed as the most loyal citizens of any society but even the faith of United enthusiasts has been stretched by the cold relationship created by the Glazers’ stance regarding communication. A tap-in, then, for Ratcliffe is to remedy this by opening and maintaining a regular line into supporters. The Glazer family have little relationship with the Manchester United fans – something Ratcliffe would do well to avoid. Photograph: Michael Regan/Getty Images

Sen. Robert Menendez, facing bribery charges, stumps bank CEOs by asking how much their firms paid in settlements for allegedly ripping off consumers

Sen. Bob Menendez (D-N. J. ), charged with bribery, gave Wall Street bank executives a pop quiz about their own corporate misbehavior that they all failed. On Wednesday, at a congressional hearing, the embattled Menendez grilled Wall Street executives about how much money the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ordered each of their firms to pay back to consumers for allegedly violating federal laws including charging illegal junk fees and opening fake customer accounts

He started with JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon and moved down a long table asking Bank of America’s Brian Moynihan, Citigroup CEO Jane Fraser, and Wells Fargo CEO Charles Scharff how much each had “returned to customers in the form of redresses and payments at the direction of CFPB?”

Though the executives didn’t know the answer, the numbers are large, even for top Wall Street firms: $360 million for JPMorgan Chase, $819 million for Bank of America, $1 billion for Citigroup, and “over $2 billion” for Wells Fargo. All in all, it amounts to nearly $4 billion

“It’s amazing you don’t know the number because they’re not small in nature,” Menendez said. “It’s over $4 billion returned to hardworking consumers in the past dozen years. ”

Menendez’s own adherence to the law happens to also be in question. In September, the Justice Department charged him and his wife Nadine with accepting bribes and allegedly using his Senate seat to improperly aid the Egyptian government. A raid of Menendez’s house turned up $100,000 in gold bars and bundles of cash stuffed into jacket pockets. Menendez pleaded not guilty

“The lawsuit currently before the Supreme Court over the CFPB’s funding structure has the potential to upend every rule, guidance and order the CFPB has ever issued, tossing over a decade of consumer protection law out of the window,” Menendez said during the hearing to defend the CFPB. “That’s not just harmful for consumers. I think it’s dangerous to the financial system. ”

The annual Senate hearing featured eight executives, including the four Menendez questioned, from the biggest financial institutions. Executives and legislators discussed new regulations that would require the big banks to keep larger capital reserves

The big banks argued the new rules would limit their ability to lend to lower and middle income buyers. In contrast, committee chair Senator Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio) disagreed and said any reduced lending would be due to banks prioritizing riskier investments that have higher returns. “You’d rather fund risky trading and derivatives bets than boring bread and butter small business lending,” Brown said in his opening remarks. The indicted Menendez also framed some of the banks’ unpopular practices, like overdraft fees, as a decision rather than a necessity

“Charging the fees is a choice—one that disproportionately harms Black and brown communities, Menendez said. Getting rid of overdraft fees would “change the course of events for a significant part of [your] consumer base. ”

Research points to the fact that overdraft fees disproportionately affect Black and Hispanic customers. A 2021 study found that Hispanic Americans paid $3. 1 billion in overdraft fees a year Black Americans were hit with $1. 4 billion in total. Another survey found they paid double the amount of fees than White people did

Menendez commended Citibank’s Fraser for her company eliminating such fees in 2022 after government officials urged an end to the practice. Big banks like Citi also face competitive pressures from fintech startups and smaller banks, like Ally Bank, that offer bank accounts without overdraft fees. “Is it fair to say that Citi is still a profitable bank?” Menendez asked Fraser. “Yes, Senator,” Fraser replied. Menendez pressed her further, asking if their elimination led to wholesale changes at the bank. “Did [removing] overdraft fees upend your business model,” Menendez continued. “No, Senator,” Fraser answered. “We work hard to protect our customers and make sure that they don’t fall into overdraft. ”

Menendez used this line of questioning to encourage Scharff, Dimon, and Moynihan to learn from Fraser and Citigroup. “I suggest you call Mr. Fraser after this hearing to figure out how you can still be able to eliminate the fees in their entirety and still run a profitable bank,” Menendez urged Scharff, Moynihan, and Dimon. The other banks have made some steps to ease overdraft fees but haven’t done away with them completely

In 2021, JPMorgan Chase eliminated fees for overdrafts that were under $50. The new policy still led to an increase in revenue from overdraft fees, which rose 3% in 2022, a year after the policy was implemented, according to Bloomberg. Wells Fargo also loosened its rules without getting rid of the fees entirely, affording customers a 24-hour grace period to pay back any overdrafted accounts. Meanwhile, Bank of America cut its overdraft fees from $35 to $10

Dissecting impact of Israel-Hamas conflict on markets 

The world can ill-afford another full-fledged war, when economies are already battling high inflation and interest rates, an ongoing Russia-Ukraine war and now, a slowing China. This is precisely why many countries are trying to restrict any escalation in the ongoing Israel-Hamas conflict. The non-escaltion of the current hostilities seems to be the base case presumed by the Indian stock market presently, going by the market movement in the last week. The US treasury secretary also stated that the current conflict is not likely to significantly impact global economic outlook. History too shows that the these conflicts tend to have limited impact on markets. We studied the history of conflicts between Israel and Hamas, and found that these tend to have limited impact on global financial markets, across crude oil, US 10-year yields, US equities and market volatility (see charts). However, as far as trade goes, there may be some impact. In 2022-23, Israel’s share in exports from India stood at 1. 87 per cent. India shipped goods around $8billion to Israel

Petroleum products account for 65 per cent of the exports, followed by gems and jewellery (15 per cent) and electrical machinery (3 per cent).

But, what if the current hostilities turn into a full-scale conflict?

What supports this proposition is the fact that while there have been many conflicts between Israel and Hamas in the past decades, there have been none of this intensity. With at least 1,200 Israelis killed, this has been the biggest single-day killing of Jews since Holocaust, and Israel opposition is also united in retaliating. Israel has termed it a ‘War’, formed a war management cabinet with a key opposition member, and vowed to change the look of the ‘Middle East’

A massive strike by Israel in Gaza, potentially killing civilians in collateral damage, may attract more of the Middle East countries, including the de-facto leader Saudi Arabia to raise serious issues against Israel on humanitarian grounds.

Even before the Hamas attack, Saudi Arabia and Russia further cut oil production, in an already tight supply market. Iran is a big incremental supplier of oil, contributing 3 per cent to the global supply and any escalation risks taking energy prices higher.

Buckle up for more ‘turbulence’ in the housing market, BofA says—it’s a housing recession, 1980s style

Housing market pessimists have been sounding the alarm for years about a pending crash in the U. S. residential real estate market. Even before the Federal Reserve began hiking interest rates to fight inflation last year, pushing mortgage rates to a 23-year high this month, years of surging home prices left some experts warning that the housing market was a massive bubble ready to pop

However, despite a widely bearish outlook in the industry, most real estate veterans have avoided arguing that home prices will drop like they did during the 2008 crash that kicked off the Global Financial Crisis (GFC). And so far, that’s been a wise decision. It took until June 2022 for national home prices to peak, even as mortgage rates soared and purchase applications plummeted amid the Fed’s first interest rate hikes. And while prices fell more than 5% from that peak by January of this year, they returned to a record high in July

Still, a Bank of America team led by U. S. economist Jeseo Park warned this week that there’s more “turbulence” coming for the housing market due to high mortgage rates. They explained that they’re getting an eerie feeling of “déjà vu,” but it’s not 2008 that is coming to mind, it’s the 1980s. “Looking back at previous housing recessions, we think the 1980s are a better analogy for today’s market than the 2008 housing crash,” they wrote in a Thursday note

This isn’t 2008

While the housing crash of 2008—fueled by the collapse of subprime mortgages—haunts the memories of many Americans, the real estate market of that era was very different from what Bank of America’s experts see today. Park and her team noted that there are no “noticeable signs” of excess housing development today like there were back then, and households aren’t nearly as burdened by mortgage debt. Household mortgage debt represented roughly 65% of U. S. consumers’ disposable income in the second quarter, compared to 100% before the GFC

And the ratio of Americans’ mortgage debt to their real estate assets—also called loan-to-value—was just 27% in the second quarter, compared to over 40% in 2008 and roughly 50% in 2010, Bank of America’s data shows. New legislation was also enacted since the GFC to help prevent worst-case scenarios in the housing market. One of the most obvious effects of these new laws is that there are far fewer risky adjustable-rate mortgages today

Adjustable-rate mortgages can lead to higher default rates when interest rates rise, but they now represent less than 5% of total purchase and refinance loans, compared with over 35% at the peak of the pre-GFC housing cycle. “We reiterate that we do not expect another housing crash like 2008,” Park and her team concluded after presenting this evidence. Is it a repeat of the ‘turbulence’ of the 1980s?

According to Bank of America, today’s housing market looks a lot more like the early 1980s than it does 2008

Back then, just like today, home prices had boomed for years before Fed officials were ultimately forced to hike interest rates aggressively in an attempt to fight inflation. The rise in the consumer price index peaked at around 14% in 1980 before then–Fed Chair Paul Volcker’s hawkish policies sent mortgage rates to 18% in a year’s time, cooling inflation, but sparking a recession. This caused a serious downturn in the housing market in which home sales and building levels cratered. However, national home prices actually remained stable

At the start of Volcker’s term as Fed chair in August 1979, the median U. S. home sales price was $64,700. And even after a near doubling of mortgage rates, that figure rose to $69,400 by the second quarter of 1981. Over the past 18 months, the Fed’s current chair, Jerome Powell, has been following a very similar game plan to Volcker’s, raising interest rates aggressively to quash inflation. The average 30-year fixed mortgage rate, the most common type of mortgage in the U. S. , has soared from 3. 8% in March 2022 to over 7

5% today as a result. This, in turn, has slowed mortgage purchase applications and caused home sales to plummet, just as it did in the ’80s; but home prices, echoing the dynamic of that era, have yet to collapse. One of the key reasons for the resilience of the housing market in both of these periods is demographics. “Noticeably, demographics were favorable back then, with baby boomers having entered the prime homebuying age,” Park and her team wrote Thursday, arguing millennials are in a similar position today

“Some sales activity should be supported by millennials reaching the prime homebuying age, and single-family building permits have steadily held up. This can help the housing market retain some of its momentum without falling apart. ”

Bank of America economists believe that low inventory of existing homes for sale combined with solid home sales to millennials could help put a “floor beneath home prices,” but that doesn’t mean there won’t be some near-term pain due to higher mortgage rates. “With rates likely staying higher for longer, we are cautious of potential turbulence ahead,” the group warned

Bank of America has previously forecast 0% home price growth and falling home sales for the full year 2023, but it didn’t offer a new prediction in its latest note.

"There are no sacred numbers"

The first week of fighting in the bitter war in Israel’s south is almost over, with the financial markets trying to gauge the damage that the Israeli economy will sustain. Clearly, we are talking about a very significant event, but the fog of war makes it hard to estimate its full consequences. The main index on the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange, the Tel Aviv 35, fell 6. 4% over the week. Prof

Leo Leiderman, chief economic adviser at Bank Hapoalim and a professor of economics at Tel Aviv University, sets out for "Globes" his proposals for rehabilitating the economy and repairing the damage that the war will cause. What has been going through your mind in these first days of the war?

"What most preoccupies me is not the economy but concern for the families of the soldiers, the wounded, and the captives, and solidarity with them. I have four relatives from Kibbutz Nir Oz who are still missing, and we have no information about them

--- Chunk ---
I find it hard to understand how a war like this landed on us in a country as powerful as Israel. But we have no choice but to win. "

As for the effect of the war on economic activity, Leiderman says: "First of all, the duration and character of the war will have a decisive impact on the depth of damage to the economy. Many studies, as well as past experience, indicate that the longer the war lasts, the broader will be the impact on the economy

--- Chunk ---
It is also known that this connection between the length of the fighting and the economic damage might not be linear. And of course, the more the war widens to more fronts, the greater will be the economic damage. "

Do you have a forecast for the consequences of the war for economic growth?

"It’s too early to make a quantitative estimate of the effects on the growth of the economy in 2024 and 2025

--- Chunk ---
We have a great deal of information about loss of growth and product in various episodes in the past, such as the Yom Kippur War, the Lebanon War, two intifadas, various military operations, and the Covid pandemic. "We see this is a completely different episode, however. This is a new situation that has no precedent as far as the damage to the economy is concerned. There’s a whole spectrum of possible scenarios, from a short war on the southern front only, to the nightmare scenario of a prolonged war with additional sectors involved

--- Chunk ---
We are only in the fifth day of the war, and it’s to be hoped that the picture will start to become clearer. "

Which industries will be hit by the war?

"A substantial decline can be expected in private consumption, particularly of services. This is not just because of the damage to output and income, but also for psychological reasons. Distress, uncertainty, the possibility of prolonged reserve duty by some of the public - all these things will affect consumer sentiment. Alongside this, tourism, commerce, transport services, entertainment, and restaurants will be hurt

What’s your view of the Bank of Israel’s move in the foreign exchange market?

Leiderman: "It’s important to welcome the Bank of Israel’s decision to intervene, as necessary, in the foreign exchange market, in order to ensure the market’s regular operation. The decision to extend the term of Amir Yaron as governor of the bank at least for the duration of the war, and I hope beyond that, is also a stabilizing factor.

The behavior of the investment community in Israel, including the financial institutions, indicates high confidence in the economy’s resilience and financial strength. It’s important to maintain a level-headed, correct economic policy that will preserve this ‘asset. ’"

What about the economic cost of the war?

"As with any war, the current war has and will have direct and indirect impacts. The war will substantially raise defense spending in the coming years, for procurement of equipment, ammunition, and advanced systems in accordance with the new needs. Another direct expense is payment for the reserve duty days of those mobilized

Given current interest rate levels around the world, the cost of servicing public debt as a proportion of GDP will rise. Besides all this, there will be a decline in state revenues from taxation and a rise in the fiscal deficit. "

), and that will happen, it’s permissible for a country at war to raise its fiscal deficit by what is seen as the right amount. This is in order to ensure that the economy functions properly, to carry out rehabilitation actions, and to prepare for recovery and a return to growth in the near future. "

How high should the deficit go?

"I mean a deficit of 3% of GDP, or 5%, or 8% - there are no sacred numbers. As was said during the Covid pandemic, the state has to do whatever it takes to achieve these goals

Nevertheless, it’s important to make sure that the growth in expenditure and in the deficit is temporary, until economic activity gets back to normal. I’m also sure that there are various budget items that were approved that don’t support economic growth, and that don’t need to be implemented in the new reality. Such a policy will be accepted with complete understanding by investors overseas and in Israel, and also by the credit rating agencies

What else do you propose on the economic policy plane?

"Despite the uncertainty over how the war will develop, alongside an emergency budget, this is the time to start preparing a general economic plan with a strategy for rehabilitating the economy after the war.

"

How do you propose doing this?

"One possibility is to task the Bank of Israel and the Ministry of Finance Budgets Division with coordinating the work, with help from the various research institutes and economists, engineers, and professionals in academic institutions and in the private sector. It’s important to talk to the private sector, and to understand in every place and every industry what the main damage is and what they need in order to get back to normal. It should be done professionally, preferably with no politicization of the recommendations

"

What do you think the Bank of Israel should do in its next interest rate decision, on October 23?

"It’s still to early to tell how the war will affect the rate of inflation in the short and medium term. Just as there are new inflationary factors, such as the depreciation of the shekel, there will also be factors working in the opposite direction, given the expected decline in private consumption, tourism, and other items. "As with fiscal policy, here too a country at war is allowed to deviate temporarily from the set inflation target

--- Chunk ---
At the moment there is no surge in inflation expectations, and the investment community is aware of the existence of index-linked assets and the exchange rate that can assist in hedging inflation risk. "As for cutting the interest rate, it’s too early to consider that. The current interest rate is at the right level for the state of the economy, and together with the policy on exchange rates, it contributes to ensuring financial stability," Leiderman concludes.

&#039;Massive intel failure by Mossad&#039;: Hamas&#039; surprise attack on Israel shocks internet

Hamas' surprise attack on Israel has shocked many who are now questioning the country's famed intelligence agency Mossad, which is known for its intelligence-gathering capability. For some, the belief that Mossad was among the best in the spying world was shattered today when Hamas carried out the biggest coordinated attack in Israel and captured some territory in southern Israel. It is not the attack that has surprised people but the scale at which Hamas operated and got control of some military bases and soldiers

Israel's blockade of Gaza means that a region the size of Philadelphia faces a real risk of starvation, says Peace Studies scholar

International aid groups are warning that they cannot deliver food and other basic services to people in the Gaza Strip and that a “dire” humanitarian crisis is set to worsen. International aid groups provide food and other means of support to about 63% of people in Gaza. Israel stopped allowing deliveries of food, fuel and other supplies to Gaza’s 2. 3 million residents on Oct. 10, 2023, and is reportedly preparing for a ground invasion. On Oct. 12, 2023, Israel warned 1. 1 million Gaza residents in the northern section of the enclave to leave for the southern region, in advance of a potential ground invasion. I am a scholar of peace and conflict economics and a former World Bank consultant, including during the 2014 war between Hamas and Israel. International aid groups now face the same problem in Gaza that local businesses and residents have encountered for about 16 years: a blockade that prevents civilians and items, like medicine from easily moving into or out of the enclosed area, roughly 25 miles long

That 16-year blockade did not apply to the food and fuel that groups brought in to Gaza. Now, it does. Gaza’s blockade and economy

Gaza is about the size of Philadelphia and requires trade with different businesses and countries in order to maintain and grow its economy. But Gaza is heavily dependent on foreign aid. This is partially the result of Israel setting up permanent air, land and sea blockades around Gaza in 2007, one year after Hamas rose to political power

Egypt, which borders Gaza on its southern end, also oversees one checkpoint that specifically limits people coming and going. While Israel has granted permits to about 17,000 Gaza residents to enter and work in Israel, the food, fuel and medical supplies that people in Gaza use all first pass through Israel. Israel controls two physical checkpoints along Gaza, which monitor both the entry and exit of people and trucks. Israel limits the kind and quantity of materials that pass into Gaza

And the blockades generally prohibit Gazans who do not have work permits or special clearance – for medical purposes, for example – from entering Israel. Israel’s restrictions through the blockade intensified since Hamas’ surprise attack on 20 Israeli towns and several military bases on Oct. 7, with Israel then announcing a broad blockade of imports into Gaza. This stopped all food, fuel and medical supplies from entering the region. Gaza’s isolation

6 billion in losses each year, as the value of the imports they receive greatly outweighs the value of the items they produce and sell elsewhere. More than 53% of Gaza residents were considered below the poverty line in 2020, and about 77% of Gazan households receive some form of aid from the United Nations and other groups, mostly in the form of cash or food. Gaza’s weak economy is caused by a number of complex factors, but the largest is the blockade and the economic and trade isolation it creates. For the average Gazan, the blockade has several practical effects, including people’s ability to get food. About 64% of people in Gaza are considered food insecure, meaning they do not have reliable access to sufficient amounts of food. Food as a percentage of Gaza’s total imports has skyrocketed by 50% since 2005, when Israel first imposed a temporary blockade. And the amount of food the West Bank and Gaza actually produce has tumbled by 30% since then. It is hard for Gaza to produce food within its own borders

The biggest of these aid groups in Gaza is the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East – also known as UNRWA. Today, UNRWA is the second-largest employer in Gaza, following Hamas. It provides the bulk of the education, food aid and health care services for people in Gaza, in addition to 3 million other people registered as Palestinian refugees who live in Jordan, Lebanon, Syria, the West Bank and other places. Over time, UNRWA has evolved into a kind of parallel government, alongside Hamas, which Israel, the United States and other countries designate as a terrorist organization. UNRWA funds and runs a network of 284 schools in Gaza alone, employing over 9,000 local people as staff and educating over 294,000 children each year. UNRWA runs 22 hospitals in Gaza that employ almost 1,000 health staff and has 3. 3 million patient visits per year. Its schools are converted into humanitarian shelters in times of crisis, such as the current war

Gen Z just saw the worst war in Israel in 50 years break out all over the internet, but they were raised on 'disturbing images'

The “disturbing images” warning is one that Gen Z, the first fully digital native cohort, is used to encountering on their lingua franca: social media posts. On Saturday, the Islamic militant group Hamas launched an unprecedented attack on Israel, resulting in the worst war the region has seen in 50 years

In three days, more than 1,500 people have died on both sides, and graphic, difficult-to-watch videos have blanketed the internet—from Israeli civilians being captured, tortured, and killed by Hamas militants, to Palestinian civilians screaming in grief, and people on both sides attending to their dead and injured among the rubble. If Gen Z feels like they’ve seen it all, in some ways, they have. This generation, ages 11 to 26, has already lived through numerous historic events, ranging from a once-per-century pandemic, to the Jan. 6 insurrection—an event unseen for centuries in American politics

One of the major sources of Gen Z’s distress, of course, is climate change. Nearly seven in 10 Gen Zers say they experience anxiety when viewing climate change content on social media, according to a 2021 Pew Research report

And extreme heat is likely here to stay—and get worse—unless countries can rapidly reduce their carbon emissions.

Gen Z in the workplace

By 2030, Gen Z will account for nearly one-third of the U. S. workforce, but they’re already radically redefining the meaning of work. Gen Zers want a sense of purpose, so they prioritize environmental, social, and governance (ESG) in the workplace, which encompasses their companies taking accountability for their sustainability and environmental impacts, providing education and awareness for social issues, and ensuring diverse and inclusive boards and teams

And it tracks: Roughly two-thirds of Gen Zers say they frequently speak about important societal issues while at work, according to the Edelman report. They’re also influencing their older coworkers when it comes to areas like work-life balance, fair pay, and employers’ involvement on social issues. Gen Z’s financial stress

But don’t forget, Gen Zers have also lived through a global pandemic that shuttered the world for nearly two years, two recessions, and a mounting student debt crisis, leaving them with little savings but an abundance of financial despair. Roughly 60% of Gen Zers say they are stressed about money this year more than last year, according to a Bankrate survey from July. It’s no surprise either—85% of Gen Zers say that they couldn’t afford one month’s expenses if they lost their job today. And since young people are typically affected by inflation the most, as they are the most likely to work part-time or low-paying jobs, this economic climate may have left Gen Z with permanent “psychological scars,” one expert says

The result was that five Rogers Communications directors were fired, replaced by five allies of Edward Rogers.

In early 2022, family members agreed to temporarily shelve their disagreements, according to this week’s court filing, to avoid negative publicity as the company sought regulators’ approval for the takeover of Shaw Communications Inc. The C$20 billion transaction was the company’s biggest deal ever and among the largest corporate transactions in Canadian history. Negotiations Collapse

As part of that truce, Rogers-Hixon and Martha Rogers agreed not to participate in board discussions about the Shaw deal or receive materials on it, because of an argument about Rogers-Hixon’s personal lawyer, whose firm also does work for Telus Corp. , a competitor to Rogers and Shaw. The Shaw takeover finally closed on April 3 of this year, and the Rogers siblings engaged in talks “intended to resolve all issues between us,” Rogers-Hixon stated in an affidavit. “I was hopeful all issues could be resolved without negative publicity. ” But those negotiations collapsed last month, she said

The committee has asked for copies of “all correspondence” between Rogers-Hixon and former CEO Natale, three other former executives, the five ousted directors, Martha Rogers, journalists and others, according to a letter to Rogers-Hixon that’s included with the court filing. “The investigation is intended to inform decisions that may be made about your status as a director of RCI,” says the letter signed by Robert Gemmell, a former Citigroup Inc. banker who is Rogers’ lead director

Although the company is controlled by a family trust, it’s structured in a way that gives significant power to the trust’s chair, in this case Edward Rogers, the only son of late founder Ted Rogers. That’s what allowed him to reshape the board in 2021 over the opposition of family members. The family dynamics have grown even more complicated in recent months because of the deaths of three key insiders.

Beyoncé tops box office with $21 million debut for concert film ‘Renaissance’

Beyoncé ruled the box office this weekend. Her concert picture, “ Renaissance: A Film by Beyoncé,” opened in first place with $21 million in North American ticket sales, according to estimates from AMC Theatres Sunday. The post-Thanksgiving, early December box office is notoriously slow, but “Renaissance” defied the odds. Not accounting for inflation, it’s the first time a film has opened over $20 million on this weekend in 20 years (since “The Last Samurai”). Beyoncé wrote, directed and produced “Renaissance,” which is focused on the tour for her Grammy-winning album. It debuted in 2,539 theaters in the U. S. and Canada, as well as 94 international territories, where it earned $6. 4 million from 2,621 theaters. “On behalf of AMC Theatres Distribution and the entire theatrical industry, we thank Beyoncé for bringing this incredible film directly to her fans,” said Elizabeth Frank, AMC Theatres executive vice president of worldwide programming, in a statement

“To see it resonate with fans and with film critics on a weekend that many in the industry typically neglect is a testament to her immense talent, not just as a performer, but as a producer and director. ”

Despite several other new releases including “Godzilla Minus One,” the Hindi-language “Animal,” Angel Studios’ sci-fi thriller “The Shift,” and Lionsgate’s John Woo-directed revenge pic “Silent Night,” it was a slow weekend overall. Films in the top 10 are expected to gross only $85 million in total

But it was in this traditional “lull” that AMC Theatres found a good opportunity for “Renaissance” to shine. “They chose a great weekend,” said Paul Dergarabedian, the senior media analyst for Comscore. “There was competition but it was from very different kinds of movies. ”

Though “Renaissance” did not come close to matching the $92. 8 million debut of “Taylor Swift: The Eras Tour” in October, it’s still a very good start for a concert film. No one expected “Renaissance” to match “The Eras Tour,” which is wrapping up its theatrical run soon with over $250 million globally. Prior to Swift, the biggest concert film debuts (titles held by Miley Cyrus and Justin Bieber for their 2008 and 2011 films) had not surpassed the unadjusted sum of $32 million. The 39-city, 56-show “Renaissance” tour, which kicked off in Stockholm, Sweden in May and ended in Kansas City, Missouri in the fall, made over $500 million and attracted over 2. 7 million concertgoers. Swift’s ongoing “Eras Tour,” with 151 dates, is expected to gross some $1. 4 billion. Both Beyoncé and Swift chose to partner with AMC Theatres to distribute their films, as opposed to a traditional studio

Both superstars have been supportive of one another, making splashy appearances at the other’s premieres. Both had previously released films on Netflix (“Miss Americana” and “Homecoming”). And both are reported to be receiving at least 50% of ticket sales. Movie tickets to the show were more expensive than average, around $23. 32 versus Swift’s $20. 78, according to data firm EntTelligence. Critics and audiences gave “Renaissance” glowing reviews – it’s sitting at 100% on Rotten Tomatoes and got a coveted A+ CinemaScore from opening weekend audiences who were polled

EntTelligence also estimates that the audience, around 900,000 strong, skewed a little older than Swift’s. “To have two concert films topping the chart in a single year is pretty unprecedented,” Dergarabedian said. But to compare them too closely would be a mistake. “Taylor Swift was a total outlier and the result of a very specific set of circumstances,” he said. “These two films are similar in genre only. “

Lionsgate’s “ The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes ” fell to second place in its third weekend with an estimated $14. 5 million

Japan’s prime minister Kishida says: ‘reassess our economy’

Throughout September, in Tokyo, New York, Hong Kong and London, the world’s biggest investment banks hosted a series of conferences for the world’s biggest investors, all gravitating around the same theme: is Japan really back?

And, according to both the attendees and hosts of those events — which were run by JPMorgan, Goldman Sachs, Bank of America, Mizuho, BNP Paribas, and Jefferies — the answer is now clearer than it has been in a very long time

Japan is back, but global investors may take a little more persuasion that it is truly back for the duration. So, this week, prime minister Fumio Kishida will make his strongest ever push for a bet on Asia’s biggest advanced economy — as BlackRock founder Larry Fink, and other heads of global funds, gather in Tokyo for a series of events to attract investment

“I would urge you to evaluate what we are doing in my country, look at the underlying strength of our economy and our plans for the future and then invest in Japan,” Kishida said in a recent speech at the Economic Club of New York.

But, because so many global funds have diverted expertise away from Japan in recent years, they are concerned that they need to know more, as a matter of urgency. “There is heightened interest in Japan after what has been, for many, a long period of not being focused on that country,” says Paul Hitchens, the head of the Japan research department at Jefferies, which hosted a major investor conference in Hong Kong

There are distinctive catalysts for that, he adds — noting a recent push by the Tokyo Stock Exchange for companies to improve their capital efficiency, and the high profile decision of Warren Buffett to invest heavily in five of Japan’s largest trading houses. Hitchens says: “Is there some healthy scepticism? Yes

However, global investment firms know that they need to invest and build their offerings in Japan to meet the growing appetite, and that they need to pay attention to an equity market at a 33-year high. ”

Large global funds are not the only ones to have had their interest in Japan piqued, says Keith Truelove, head of global markets at UBS Securities Japan. “There is still a lot of dry powder on the sidelines,” he observes. “There is a lot of interest in Japan from family offices and from high net worth individual investors, who value wealth preservation more highly than institutional investors — it’s really taking off now

”

“They took their time to decide if it was safe to invest in Japan again, because they need to get confidence in the idea that the Japan story will be more sustainable this time,” Truelove adds. He notes that Japan has offered investors a number of false-dawns over the years, and the bar for deciding that ‘this time is different’ remains high. One of the most significant changes, say asset managers, is the fundamental shift in the way global funds now look at China

The geopolitics of US-China tensions, chip wars, decoupling and “friendshoring” seem, in particular, to be working significantly in Japan’s favour. Asia-focused global investment is rotating out of China and into Tokyo stocks, real estate and other assets, just as large parts of corporate Japan are engaging more actively with shareholders than at any time in the past. China, after years of stunning growth and investor attention, is very rapidly losing that sheen. Its economy is growing more slowly and the expected post-pandemic rebound is proving elusive

On top of that, Beijing’s policymaking — with its sudden crackdowns on entire industries, like video games and private tutoring, has generated a series of nasty surprises — and the unshakeable fear that others could occur at any time. “You are seeing more interest in Japan from investors, who were primarily invested in China, as China has slowed and some of its economic policies have been confusing and opaque,” says Kirk Neureiter, president of Fidelity Management & Research Japan. “Deployment of capital to China has been a bit more risky in terms of eventual outcome of investment decisions, given that lack of clarity. ” But interest in Japan has not only come about because of the push away from China, he adds. Japanese companies are increasingly aligning themselves with the interests of shareholders in a way that once seemed unlikely. Part of that, he says, is generational

Companies that replace their chief executive on five or seven year cycles now have leaders that reached their positions after the establishment of Japan’s stewardship code (in 2014) and corporate governance code (2015). Many have a very different view of the role of a chief executive than their predecessors did. “I think that Japan, in terms of the unifying message that companies and the Tokyo Stock Exchange are sending out, now gives a lot more confidence about where they are deploying capital,” says Neureiter. “So people looking at the region are finding Japan incrementally more attractive

Moreover, the proportion of these companies not contemplating the implementation of digital twins appears to have reduced to 9% in 2023, down from 33. 6% in 2020. Supporting this trend, an analysis of job postings on SimplyHired suggests a growing demand for digital twin expertise. Postings mentioning “digital twin” increased by 11% in October 2023 compared to just two years prior, while openings for most other tech topics declined in the same timeframe. Notably, among the 60 tech-related skill sets we tracked, digital twin-related skills experienced one of the most significant growths. Based on these observations and additional insights from our report, our current projection estimates that the global digital twin market could grow at a CAGR of approximately 30% between 2023 and 2027. Against the backdrop of this growing market, the report notes eight trends that help promote the advancement and adoption of digital twins. Here, we will focus on four:

1. Digital twins deployed to meet sustainability goals

2. Digital twins employed as virtual sensors in complex conditions

3. Partnerships between cloud hyperscalers and OT and simulation specialists

In terms of the digital twin market, our market model only considers software spending for digital twins, which we break into two scopes:

Broad digital twin market – includes the revenue for all software solutions that provide capabilities that are used for digital twins, such as solutions that integrate data sources into a digital twin and are capable of simulation, visualization, and predictions

– includes the revenue for all software solutions that provide capabilities that are used for digital twins, such as solutions that integrate data sources into a digital twin and are capable of simulation, visualization, and predictions Narrow digital twin market – only considers spending for digital twin-specific software, such as software intended to model the digital twin data

Though hardware and services related to digital twins can bolster the capabilities of digital twin software, we only view them as supporting services for the software, and we do not consider them in our digital twin market model

That said, this ability to bolster capabilities means they can aid digital twin market growth, as shown in some of the trends below. Digital twin market trends

We will now look at four trends helping digital twin market growth. Trend 1: Digital twins deployed to meet sustainability goals

Sustainability was discussed in approximately 21% of recent CEO earnings calls and has remained a consistent topic throughout 2023. This pairs with our report’s analysis that the pursuit of sustainability goals is a tailwind macro factor for the digital twin market. To achieve their sustainability goals, many companies are exploring digital twins. Due to their ability to simulate real-world conditions and deliver real-time information, organizations can optimize resource usage, reducing carbon emissions and improving supply and transportation networks. According to Capgemini Research Institute’s 2022 digital twins report, 57% of organizations agreed that one of the key drivers for their digital twin investments was improving their sustainability, and 51% agreed that digital twins would help achieve their organization’s environmental sustainability goals. In our report, a former VP at an industrial automation vendor shared, “Digital solutions provide the visibility, analysis, and insight needed to address the challenges inherent in sustainability goals

3D simulations assist facility managers in visualizing, predicting, and optimizing energy consumption, and the expected benefits include lower annual energy consumption, water usage, and waste. Trend 2: Digital twins employed as virtual sensors in complex conditions

Virtual sensors approximate data that otherwise cannot be obtained via physical sensors, often due to physical sensors being impractical, costly, or hazardous to employ. Companies are now building digital twins to model hardware and calculate data based on other conditions. This not only allows the collection of data from complex equipment but also enables operators to track equipment performance and predict maintenance and downtimes

Example: In large motor applications, such as room-sized motors that pump high volumes of gas, oil, or other chemicals, operators need to monitor the motors’ temperatures—especially if the motors are high-powered and repeatedly started. If a motor is too hot during a restart, the components could cause serious damage. Unfortunately, using a direct, physical sensor within a motor is often impractical, and operators must work from an assumptive time it takes for the motor to cool (with an additional safety buffer time). This means motors can be down longer than necessary, impacting efficiency and revenue

To address this issue, Siemens developed a prototype virtual sensor based on a digital twin. It offers a simulation of how a physical sensor would operate if it were possible to install it within a motor. Using AR headsets, operators can see a simulation of the motor and its interior with a demonstrator superimposed over it, and they can see the motor’s temperature.

, AWS IoT TwinMaker and Azure Digital Twins, that allow for interconnecting various data sources and building digital twin topology. However, these companies realize they cannot deliver end-to-end digital twin solutions by themselves and are thus partnering with OT and simulation companies to add capabilities to their networks. Hyperscalers and OT companies

OT companies provide industrial data management capabilities and connections to millions of local physical assets. By partnering with hyperscalers, OT companies can reach broader audiences looking for digital transformation solutions by offering typical cloud benefits like storage and computation power. Example: In 2021, Siemens and AWS announced an expansion of their partnership, with digital twin technology being an area of focus. The companies aimed to accelerate Siemens Xcelerator adoption and democratize new digital twin solutions using AWS IoT TwinMaker, a service intended to make creating digital twins that incorporate multiple data sources faster and easier. Hyperscalers and simulation companies

Simulation companies bring specialized expertise in creating accurate, high-fidelity models of physical entities, be it machinery, buildings, or entire ecosystems

Trend 4: Initiatives promoting interoperability of digital twins across systems from different vendors

Agreement on integration standards among the various digital twin technology providers is crucial for building cross-system digital twins. With standards, manufacturers can offer services that can be applied to unique situations with other digital twin technology and software. Recognizing this, countries and industry organizations have taken several steps to address this need:

Plattform Industrie 4. 0 and CESMII

Plattform Industrie 4. 0 and the Clean Energy Smart Manufacturing Innovation Institute (CESMII) partnered to establish standards for manufacturers in Germany and the United States to better enable smart, sustainable competition. The partnership addressed similar challenges related to Industry 4. 0 and Smart Manufacturing. DTC digital twin interoperability framework

Spanish artist Iñigo Quintero’s Si No Estás rose to the top of Spotify‘s Global Top 50 in late October – and has stubbornly refused to leave the upper reaches of digital charts ever since. (Even amongst the early December onslaught of Christmas standards in Spotify’s flagship global chart, the Spanish-language track currently remains comfily snuggled in at No. 7. )

To date, having only been released on September 23, Si No Estás has racked up over 330 million plays on Spotify, and over 100 million on YouTube. From a music industry perspective, Si No Estás is especially interesting because it provided Believe, the Paris-headquartered indie biz giant, with its first-ever chart-topper on Spotify’s Global Top 50. Iñigo Quintero – who last week released his follow-up track. Lo Que Queda de Mí – was signed to Believe in March via indie label/aggregator Acqustic. The act’s worldwide success is just part of the story of Believe’s steady growth in Latin music in the past few years, which has been led by Alejandra Olea, the company’s Managing Director, Americas

Spanish and Latin artists have much more options to develop their audiences and monetize their music at each stage of their career. Artists like Iñigo Quintero and labels like Acqustic are prime examples of this profound shift within the Latin and wider music industry. We are in a world where music discovery and consumption are now primarily digital, and artists have now understood that. They look for partners who get it too and whose expertise will allow them to leverage digital platforms to reach new and existing audiences wherever they are. “Artists today are also much more conscious of their career trajectory and look for better deals, with more freedom, more transparency, and more options. ”

This is especially the case in Spanish-speaking markets, where music fans are amongst the most engaged audiences in the world, whether on digital platforms or on social media. Music content is consumed with more frequency, in different formats, across multiple platforms and through different aspects related to the track. Beyond that, artists today are also much more conscious of their career trajectory and look for better deals, with more freedom, more transparency, and more options

We do see, all around the world, more and more artists able to reach massive levels of success, not only in their own markets, but internationally too, without the need to for major label support and traditional label deals. At Believe, Inigo has of course been a fantastic example of this. But we have also had similar success stories in other markets, notably France, where the Top 5 albums of the week of June 16th where all by artists signed to Believe directly or through their labels

Michelle Jubelirer on Ice Spice, The Beatles, and reinventing Capitol Music Group: ‘I don’t think any label group has been able to turn things around as quickly as my team and I have done in less than two years. ’

Two years ago, this writer sat down for a Chinese meal on a chilly winter’s night in London with Michelle Jubelirer and some of her closest allies at Capitol Music Group. Jubelirer had just been promoted to Chair and CEO of the Los Angeles-based label group – a key pillar of Universal Music Group

The mood that night was suitably celebratory… but it was also, it’s fair to say, imbued with knowledge of a tough road ahead. Jubelirer was widely tipped as the natural successor to Steve Barnett when the British exec stood down as head of CMG in 2020. She had been by Barnett’s side throughout a run of success at CMG over multiple years – via artists like Sam Smith, Halsey, Paul McCartney, and Lewis Capaldi, as well as transformative deals like a JV between Motown (then part of CMG) and Quality Control

In actuality, Jubelirer’s immediate ascension to running CMG was not forthcoming. Instead, Barnett was succeeded in December 2020 as Chairman/CEO of the label group by Jeff Vaughn, a fast-rising exec who’d previously impressed as a data-and-socials-savvy A&R at Mike Caren’s Artist Partner Group (APG). Mid-pandemic, Vaughn entered CMG with bold ideas, but it didn’t take a genius to figure out there was a culture clash: Within a startlingly short 12 months, Vaughn was gone from CMG. (He has since launched his label JV, Signal Records, with Sony‘s Columbia)

In the wake of this corporate untidiness, Jubelirer was (some may suggest was overdue-ly) named Chair & CEO of Capitol Music Group. Her most pressing brief? Calm everything the hell down, and get the Good Ship Capitol out of the eye of the hurricane. So, the mood at that Chinese dinner? Understandable. Yet if some nervous energy was detected that night, so was a healthy confidence. Jubelirer and co. have been putting both to good use ever since

Two years on, Jubelirer’s CMG hasn’t only returned to calmer waters – with US market share YTD in the high-5% region – it’s also achieved some glittering successes while priming a promising array of new talent. A key example: CMG, along with its colleagues at Capitol UK and the artist’s team, has been behind the Grammy-winning global smash that is Sam Smith’s Unholy (an unapologetically ribald banger from a singer who refuses to be pigeonholed as a sweet balladeer). CMG has also been a crucial partner, alongside Elliot Grainge‘s 10K Projects, in the rise of Ice Spice

Other priorities at Capitol over the past 12 months have included Tampa-born rapper/singer Doechii, signed to CMG via a JV partnership with Top Dawg and TDE at the start of Jubelirer’s reign as Chair/CEO of CMG.

Structurally, Jubelirer has had some fun and games to contend with at CMG in her first two years in charge. One of Jubelirer’s most successful gambits, indie distribution/services company Caroline (later Virgin Music) was in recent years ‘spun out’ of CMG – forming a foundation for the global UMG priority venture that is today known as Virgin Music Group. Meanwhile, Motown was also ‘spun out’ of CMG, to become a standalone frontline label, in early 2021… before being ‘spun back’ into CMG at the top of this year

Capitol Music Group is in significantly stronger shape than it’s been for a while. It also feels meaningfully influential in pop culture – with several tracks in TikTok’s end-of-year / most popular playlists. It’s fair to say things looked less steady when you took over as CEO & Chair in 2021

As you well know, [before Jubelirer was named CEO/Chair] CMG had undergone a few leadership changes within a short period of time, and that turmoil was compounded by the economic volatility of the pandemic. As a result, the company faced eroding market share, low morale, and a stagnant artist roster

What have been the pros and cons of that move for you?

Virgin [first, Caroline] was a major priority for us since the launch of Capitol Music Group in 2012. We really prioritized this area, and oversaw the transition from Caroline into Virgin directly within our company. We were so fortunate to have the talent, and friendship, of [now-Virgin Music Group President] Jacqueline [Saturn] and her team as part of our company for many years

It wouldn’t have made sense to have multiple indie label/artist services divisions within UMG, so the plan to globalize Virgin and scale it to work with all the labels made so much sense. Do I miss having Jacqueline and her team only a few steps away? Of course. But I’m proud of the crucial roles they’ve played in Virgin’s growth and evolution, and we work as closely together as we ever did. On the flip side, Motown has returned as an imprint within CMG after a period as a standalone label. Obviously, that came with an inevitable downsizing process

As Arjun can tell you, digital marketing was key to the effort; the song is in the Top 3 of all-time creations and shares for a pre-release campaign, and the global teams worked together brilliantly to connect that pre-release momentum to the biggest looks at the DSPs, in the media and at radio. The fact that Unholy broke records at the streaming services was extremely gratifying, and the Grammy that they won with Kim Petras was so well-deserved

Nike misses revenue expectations for the first time in two years, beats on earnings and gross margin

Nike reported revenue Thursday that fell short of Wall Street's sales expectations for the first time in two years, but it beat on earnings and gross margin estimates, sending its stock soaring in after-hours trading. Here's how the sneaker giant performed during its fiscal first quarter compared with what Wall Street was anticipating, based on a survey of analysts by LSEG, formerly known as Refinitiv:

Earnings per share: 94 cents vs. 75 cents expected

Revenue: $12. 94 billion vs. $12. 98 billion expected

The company's reported net income for the three-month period that ended August 31 was $1. 45 billion, or 94 cents per share, compared with $1. 47 billion, or 93 cents per share, a year earlier. Sales rose to $12. 94 billion, up about 2% from $12. 69 billion a year earlier. Revenue for the quarter was just shy of the $12. 98 billion analysts had expected, according to LSEG. Nike shares rose about 8% in extended trading Thursday. The retailer maintained its full-year guidance of revenue growth in the mid-single digits and gross margin expansion of 1

Investors have been laser focused on Nike's recovery in China, its relationship with its wholesale partners and how the resumption of student loan payments will impact sales. They're also keen to see Nike's margins recover after bloated inventories, high promotions and supply chain woes contributed to lower profits over the last few quarters. During the quarter, Nike's gross margin fell about 0. 1 percentage points to 44. 2%, but it was higher than the 43. 7% analysts had expected, according to StreetAccount. The company attributed the gross margin drop to higher product costs and currency exchange rates, but those trends were offset by price increases, which contributed to the earnings beat. Sales in China grew by 5% compared to the year-ago period to $1. 7 billion, which fell short of the $1. 8 billion analysts had expected, according to StreetAccount. During the previous quarter ended May 31, Nike saw China sales jump 16% compared to the year-ago period. But the numbers were against easy comparisons because the region was still under Covid-related lockdown orders during the prior year

While Nike remains bullish on China, the region's economic recovery has so far been a mixed bag. Following a sluggish July, retail sales picked up during the month of August to rise 4. 6% compared to the prior year, beating expectations of a 3% growth forecast by Reuters. "We feel good about the market there and our position," said CEO John Donahoe, adding he's traveled to China twice in the last four months. "Frankly, a couple things stand out. One, sport is back in China, you can just feel it, and that gives us great confidence about the future and the Chinese consumer in our segment, regardless of the macroeconomic outlook there. "

Nike saw sales jumps in every region besides North America, its largest market by revenue. Sales in North America fell 2% from the year-ago period to $5. 42 billion, just above the $5. 39 billion analysts had expected, according to StreetAccount. In Europe, the Middle East and Africa, sales were up 8% at $3. 61 billion. That compared with the $3. 51 billion analysts had expected

Nike's direct channel, which includes its owned stores and its digital channel, led the retailer's growth during the quarter and was up 6% compared to the prior year. In June, the company noticed that shoppers were shifting towards its stores over its digital channels, signaling consumers are getting closer to pre-pandemic shopping habits. "We continue to see that consumers want to connect directly and personally with our brands and in fact, member engagement within our direct business is up double digits versus the prior year with increasing average order values," said Friend. "Our stores delivered an especially strong quarter with traffic up double digits from last year, and members driving an increasing share of our business as consumers shifted from our digital to physical channels. Our team was nimble in transitioning inventory to capture higher full-price sales across our entire store fleet," he said. When it comes to its wholesale revenues, Nike's relationship with those partners have been rocky. As the company has pivoted to a direct-to-consumer model, it has focused on driving sales online and in its stores at the expense of its wholesale accounts

However, as Nike grappled with excess inventories throughout 2023, it relied on those partners to move through that merchandise. It has now restored its relationship with both Macy's and DSW – accounts that it previously cut in favor of its DTC strategy. Some analysts expected Nike's wholesale revenue to be sluggish during the quarter because excess inventories have been a problem throughout the retail industry – and some wholesalers are being more particular in what they order to avoid another backlog. Wholesale revenue during the quarter was flat compared to the year-ago period at $7 billion

Both Donahoe and Friend made it clear to analysts that Nike is ready to meet customers in all channels — including through wholesalers and directly. The retailer shouted out Dick's Sporting Goods as one of its key partners and noted that it's still in the process of resetting its business with Footlocker , which has seen two quarters in a row of plunging sales and profits. Despite the shift in how it's working with wholesalers, Nike insisted that direct sales will pave the way to its future growth

"Ultimately, we have a segmented portfolio of strong partners across price points and channels.

"While the ultimate landing spot of digital and direct isn't as clear, we do believe we're going to be a more direct and a more digital company, and a more profitable company," he said.

The drop was driven by a decrease in units but offset by product mix and higher manufacturing and production costs. "On the whole, we're very comfortable with the level of inventory in the marketplace in relation to the retail sales that we're seeing as we begin increasing levels of wholesale sell in our second half," said Friend. Amid decades-high inflation rates, consumers have been pulling back on apparel and footwear. With the resumption of student loan payments looming ahead, some analysts expect those sectors to take an even greater hit. Jefferies conducted a survey on U. S

Office rents in Israel stay firm - for now

Less than a month before the war, "Globes" reported a huge deal in which Amnon Shashua's unicorn AI21 Labs announced it was leasing 7,000 square meters for NIS 15 million annually in Tel Aviv's Da Vinci project. It will now be interesting to see when the next such big deal for office space is signed in Tel Aviv following the impact of the Israel-Hamas war

Sources in the income-producing property sector in Israel say that over the past few weeks there has been some interest in the sector, although mainly for smaller deals involving hundreds of square meters each. The reports: "No change in rents

Azrieli Group (TASE: AZRG), is one of the biggest companies in the sector, with 15 office buildings comprising 632,000 square meters of space and 97% occupancy. Last week Azrieli published its financial results for the third quarter of 2023 saying that the company had not been impacted by the war

However the company added that due to the uncertainty about the length of the war and its development, it could not assess the future impact of the war on business activities in Israel in general and on the company in particular. Amot Investments (TASE: AMOT), another of the biggest companies in the income-producing property sector, has 1. 15 million square meters of office space for leasing with 93. 5% occupancy with a further six projects in various stages of construction. Amot wrote, "In the third quarter several new contracts were signed including the exercising of options and the renewal of immaterial contracts for 14,000 square meters of space for an unchanged rent. "

Amot raises concerns about the continuation of the war which would lead to damage to the economy, including to the company's tenants. The report says, "The uncertainty that existed in the profitable real estate market in Israel even before the outbreak of the war and that was felt in the moderation in demand and the lengthening of the negotiations to close agreements, has intensified following the war

According to the Central Bureau of Statistics, between 2020 and 2022, construction was begun on 3. 56 million square meters of office space. Avison Young Israel co-CEO Guy Amosi says, "I am now doing four or five deals for companies that must rent space. Not large-scale deals. There are a few companies that end contracts or companies that grow and want more space. On the other hand, Midtown was written off when it was built next to Azrieli and now these are the most sought-after towers. Everything is a question of how long will it take to occupy

Amosi says that there are many areas in the central region, which in his opinion he fears could remain empty for a long time before they are occupied. He says, "A company asked us to find them 15,000 square meters and asked us to map out options for offices from Rishon Lezion to Kfar Saba.

Companies subletting are under pressure

So if there is huge supply and a fall in demand for offices, why aren't rents falling?

'Too big to fail' Egypt faces economic crisis but has an anti-Gaza refugee policy. Israel and the U. S. hope that will change

With long-held ties to Israel and a border with Gaza, Egypt’s stance is shaping up as key to the fate of any refugees and a sustained flow of aid for the besieged territory’s 2 million residents after Israel cut off crucial supplies in response to Hamas’s deadly Oct. 7 assault. That opens up opportunities for the most populous Arab nation as it wrestles with its worst economic outlook in decades and President Abdel-Fattah El-Sisi prepares for elections in less than two months’ time. A host of domestic and regional considerations, however, are seen ruling out any refugee deal

The Israeli government has spoken to counterparts in several countries about Egypt temporarily housing Palestinians fleeing the violence in Gaza, according to officials with knowledge of the matter. Israel has suggested they could be moved to tent camps in the Sinai Peninsula — funded by the United Nations and the US — and then returned once military operations end, said the people.

All the same, multiple economists, bankers and investors Bloomberg spoke with this month in Morocco during annual meetings of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank saw Egypt as likely to receive some economic backing, whatever its refugee stance. The crisis has reminded global players of the North African nation’s status as a regional linchpin, entrenching the idea it’s too big to fail. Egypt, which reached a deal with the IMF in December, is already in talks on boosting that rescue program to over $5 billion from $3 billion, people familiar with the discussions told Bloomberg this month

It’s possible the IMF’s key shareholders in the US and Europe may pressure the Washington-based lender to soften its requirements and move ahead with the program despite Cairo’s slow pace of reforms, according to Riccardo Fabiani, project director for North Africa with Crisis Group. That’s also because the current conflict serves to highlight the growing instability on all sides of Egypt, in Libya, Sudan and now in Gaza. It confronts the US and Europe with the need to ensure that “Cairo remains a stable and reliable partner in the area” that “deserves external support,” Fabiani said

Opening a route for Palestinians may also present a new security risk in the Sinai peninsula, where the army has only just managed to get a handle on its fight with Islamist militants. Jordan has also refused to accept more Palestinians and it’s unlikely Egypt would become a regional exception and take in refugees many suspect may never be let back into Gaza. That would risk being seen in the Arab world as facilitating another mass displacement and betraying the Palestinian cause all Arab countries vocally espouse

Back then there was general consensus that since Kuwait had been invaded, it needed to be supported, and while Egypt’s participation “was not met with any great joy in military circles, it was not a particularly hard sell and the debt relief was an immense added incentive,” according to the Middle East Institute’s Mabrouk. Not so today, not least because Egypt’s commitment would not be comparable with its burden in 1991 when it was the second-largest source of manpower in the US-led coalition, and so it couldn’t expect anything like a similar level of economic assistance, Satloff said

Republicans dump Jim Jordan as House Speaker nominee, leaving Congress in crisis yet again

Republicans dropped Rep. Jim Jordan on Friday as their nominee for House speaker, making the decision during a closed-door session after the hard-edged ally of Donald Trump failed badly on a third ballot for the gavel. Afterward, Jordan said simply of his colleagues, “We put the question to them, they made a different decision. ”

The hard-charging Judiciary Committee chairman said House Republicans now need to come together and “figure out who our speaker is going to be

The House impasse deepening into a full-blown crisis, Republicans have no realistic or workable plan to unite the fractured GOP majority, elect a new speaker and return to the work of Congress that has been languishing since hard-liners ousted Kevin McCarthy at the start of the month. Majority Leader Steve Scalise said they’re going “come back and start over” on Monday. Angry, frustrated Republicans who have been watching their majority control descend into chaos left the private session blaming one another for the divisions they have created

Next steps are highly uncertain as lawmakers start offering new ideas for a possible speaker. But it appears no one at present can win a GOP majority. “We’re in a very bad place right now,” McCarthy said earlier.

But after two failed votes, Jordan’s third attempt at the gavel essentially collapsed — in large part because more centrist Republicans are revolting over the nominee and the hardball tactics being used to win their votes. They have been bombarded with harassing phone calls and even reported death threats. Ahead of the vote, Jordan showed no signs of stepping aside, insisting at a Capitol press conference: “The American people are hungry for change. ”

But afterward Jordan told colleagues behind closed doors, “I tried my best,” according to one of his opponents, Rep. Don Bacon, R-Neb

What was clear was that Jordan was refusing to step aside, appearing determined to wait out his foes even as his path to become House speaker was all but collapsing.

Democratic Leader Jeffries reiterated that his party was “ready, willing and able” to partner with more traditional Republicans on a path to re-open the House —- particularly as Congress is being asked to consider President Joe Biden’s aid package for Israel, Ukraine and other needs. A closed-door meeting Thursday to regroup grew heated at times with Republican factions blaming one another for sending their majority into chaos, lawmakers said.

Republicans are loath to partner with the Democrats in a bipartisan way on the arrangement, and it’s highly unlikely Republicans could agree to give McHenry more powers on their own, since their hard-liners don’t like it. McHenry himself has brushed off attempts to take the job more permanently after he was appointed to the role after the unprecedented ouster of McCarthy more than two weeks ago. To win over GOP colleagues, Jordan had relied on backing from Trump, the party’s front-runner in the 2024 election, and groups pressuring rank-and-file lawmakers for the vote

Two of Sam Bankman-Fried's former friends from MIT, who also worked at crypto exchange FTX while living with the company's founder in the Bahamas, took the stand in a Manhattan courtroom this week to testify against their former classmate, confidant, and boss — a man who allegedly ran a crypto empire that defrauded thousands of customers out of billions of dollars.

On the drive, Bankman-Fried told Wang to transfer assets to Bahamian liquidators because he believed they would allow him to maintain control of the company. Wang said he wasn't in the meeting with the securities authority, though Bankman-Fried's dad was present. Wang said he returned to the U. S. and met with prosecutors the next day. He faces up to 50 years in prison when he faces a judge for sentencing following this trial. He told jurors he signed a six-page cooperation agreement that requires him to meet with prosecutors, answer their questions truthfully and turn over evidence

For months, Bankman-Fried has known that Wang and Ellison, who were integral members of his personal and professional inner circles, had turned on him. Both pleaded guilty in December and have since been cooperating with the U. S. attorney's office in Manhattan. Wang's testimony, which stretched into Friday, was given under a cooperation agreement with the government. Ellison is expected to take the stand under a similar arrangement. U. S.

at age 7, and grew up in Minnesota before going to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology to study math and computer science. He worked at Google after college. Wang, who first met Bankman-Fried during high school at a summer camp, owned 10% of Alameda, while his boss owned the other 90%. Wang told the court about the advantages that Alameda received by having code baked into FTX's software that allowed special access to the crypto exchange. Those privileges ultimately resulted in Alameda owing FTX $8 billion worth of customer deposits. "We gave special privileges on FTX that gave unlimited withdrawals on the platform to Alameda," Wang said. Alameda was allowed to withdraw and transfer those funds and had a $65 billion line of credit. "When customers deposited USD, it went to Alameda," he said. "It existed in the computer code. Alameda could have negative balances and unlimited withdrawals. " That "bug" in the code was written by Nishad Singh, who was FTX's director of engineering, and reviewed by Wang. Bankman-Fried was calling the shots, Wang said

Wang also told the court about a $1 million personal loan he received and a $200 million to $300 million loan in his name from Alameda that was never deposited into his account, but rather was used to make investments into other companies on behalf of FTX. That was all done by Bankman-Fried, he testified. In early 2020, Wang said he discovered for the first time Alameda's negative balance exceeded FTX's revenue, an indication that Alameda was taking customer funds.

An $8 billion bug

Adam Yedidia, who was the prosecution's second witness on Wednesday, continued his testimony on Thursday. Yedidia met Bankman-Fried in college at MIT, and the pair remained close friends. Yedidia, assuming a robotic posture on the stand, worked out of FTX's Hong Kong office from January to October of 2021 and then in the Bahamas until last year's collapse. In his testimony, he referred to a group Signal thread called "People of the House," referring to Bankman-Fried's $35 million penthouse, where many employees lived

In terms of who was paying the rent, Yedidia recalled Bankman-Fried saying he "assumed it's just Alameda paying for it in the end. " Yedidia said Bankman-Fried had told him, before he began working in the Bahamas in 2019, that he and Ellison had sex. Bankman-Fried asked Yedidia if it was a good idea for them to date, to which Yedidia said no

Bankman-Fried responded by saying he was expecting that answer. One of Yedidia's responsibilities was fixing the bug in the code that gave Alameda preferential treatment. In June 2022, he submitted a report to Bankman-Fried on Signal that showed $8 billion in customer money held in an internal database tracking the cash wired to an Alameda account called "fiat at ftx. com" was missing. Yedidia said he and Bankman-Fried spoke about it at the pickleball court at the resort in Nassau, Bahamas. He asked his boss if things were OK

He was concerned because it "seemed like a lot of money" from FTX customers was at risk. "Sam said, we were bulletproof last year. We aren't bulletproof this year," Yedidia testified. Yedidia said he asked when they would be bulletproof again. Bankman-Fried said he wasn't sure, but it may be six months to three years. Yedidia said Bankman-Fried appeared "worried or nervous," which he said was atypical. Still, Yedidia said he trusted Bankman-Fried and Ellison to "handle the situation. " On cross-examination, Christian Everdell, Bankman-Fried's attorney, focused on how Yedidia was the one responsible for developing and reviewing the code

He asked about the long hours employees worked and Yedidia's concern for Wang being near burnout. That resulted in Yedidia instituting a rule to not wake Wang at night for bug fixes because he needed sleep. Everdell also drilled Yedidia on his high level of compensation in his less than two years at FTX. His base salary was between $175,000 and $200,000, but he received multiple bonuses of more than $12 million in cash and company equity.

He invested most of the millions he earned as bonuses back into FTX, and his equity stake is now worthless. As FTX was failing, Yedidia said he was by Bankman-Fried's side. He highlighted a Signal exchange in November 2022, during which he wrote, "I love you Sam. I'm not going anywhere. " He said he wrote the message because so many people had left. When asked what changed, Yedidia said he learned that FTX customer deposits had been used to pay loans to creditors. He said Alameda's actions seemed "flagrantly wrong

From plain chemotherapy, to surgery, to radiation and now immunotherapy, cancer treatment has come a long way. Immunotherapy, as the name suggests, is a pharmaceutical way of using the body’s immune system to eradicate cancer cells. Pembrolizumab (Keytruda) approved in 2014 is the first major Monoclonal anti body or mAB from Merck. The product has raked in approvals for several cancers and has generated $20 billion in sales in 2022

This works by helping T-cells find and attack cancer cells. The PD-1 protein on T-cells is deactivated by PD-L1 protein found on the surface of a cancerous cell. Keytruda and Opdivo (from Bristol-Myers Squibb) that target PD-1 and Tecentriq (a PD-L1 inhibitor by Roche) can stop T-cells from switching off — by blocking the PD-1/PD-L1 interaction between a cancer cell and a T-cell. This allows for normal immune action on cancer cells. However, mABs have not had a high success rate. Treatment-resistant patient cohorts to mABs stood considerably high at 70-80 per cent

Combining the chemo route of toxicity and mABs’ targeted actions on cancer cells are Antibody Drug Conjugates or ADCs. These rely on an mAB to target cancer cells and then release the cytotoxin into the cancer cells. The link to join the mAB and the toxin makes ADCs a three-part drug. The three parts involved in this process, along with the fact that several mABs are available, have opened the ADC market. Compared to mABs, ADC market is dominated by smaller players

Chimeric antigen receptors (CAR), which can affect cancer cells, are then induced in these T-cells. This is done by infecting them with a nullified virus that is engineered to generate CARs. Such cells are cultured to multiply and then reinfused into the patient’s blood stream. For instance, leukemia and lymphoma cancers have CD-19 markers, which are targeted by the CAR-T cells and then they do their job of destroying the cancer cells.

These novel approaches may also address the shortcomings in hematological cancers (blood) which have not faced as much success as in solid cancers. Diabetes

Antidiabetic treatment kicked off with the discovery of the first animal-made insulin around a century ago. From there, innovation brought forth insulin synthesised from humans, synthetic insulins, longer and shorter acting insulins. Apart from pills and the ever-reliable metformin, three leading categories operate in anti-diabetes. There are Dipeptidyl Peptidase IV inhibitors (DPP-IVs Januvia/Janumet), Sodium-glucose Cotransporter-2 Inhibitors (SGLT2s Jardiance, Farxiga) and Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1RAs Trulicity, Victoza, Ozempic)

GLP-1RA is inching over the other categories with improved glycemic control in clinical trials. With positive impact on non-glycemic aspects as well including weight loss, cardiac events and kidney functions, GLPs will witness more product innovation and R&D commitment in the short term. GLP-1 is a normal peptide released by the intestine in response to a meal. This binds to GLP-1 receptors in the pancreas and activates insulin production, which is impaired in Type-2 diabetes patients. GLP-1 receptor agonists are external agents that bind to the GLP-1 receptors and elevate insulin secretion by the pancreas

But, GLP-1 receptors are also found in kidney, lung, heart, skin, immune cells, and several other tissues. This allows GLP-1RA to attain a multi-modal result, which improves cardiac and renal outcomes, and aids weight loss slower gastric emptying by binding to intestinal receptors. This feature separates GLP-1RA from other modes. Treatment regimens are now not just restricted to glycemic control.

From being a near-fatal prognosis, HIV is now a chronic condition with near-normal life expectancy. The first antiretroviral therapy (ART) started with azidothymidine in the late 90s, which belongs to the nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NRTI) class of medications.

This formulation also addresses the pill burden with a single pill. That said, by limiting viral replication, ARTs, by design, cannot cure or lead to remission of HIV. There is hope, though. By pinpointing a cohort of patients whose viral load was under control with limited treatment, researchers have identified broadly neutralising antibodies or bNAbs as a potential cure for HIV. Antibodies deal with viruses but fail to do so in HIV infection. By engineering bNAbs in a manner similar to mABs for cancer or vaccines (where antibody reaction to neutered virus generates immune protection), HIV cure may be on the horizon. Gilead’s several Phase-2 programmes with ART combination are in progress. Studies as recently as February 2023 presented proof of concept — 90 per cent participants showed virological suppression at 26 weeks. Incidentally, Gilead’s Sovaldi and Harvoni were the first cures for Hepatitis C. The World Health Organization (WHO) aims to eradicate the virus by 2030

Alzheimer’s

The degenerative disease of the brain has proved to be a difficult challenge for pharmaceutical companies. Leqembi (lecanemab), developed by Eisai in collaboration with Biogen, was the first and only approved drug for Alzheimer’s in July 2023. This comes after several failed attempts, and one controversial false start in the recent years. Alzheimer’s disease is characterised by amyloid beta deposits on brain cells leading to shrinking and loss of cognitive abilities

Despite a clear marker of amyloid plaques and a target area to work on, pharma companies failed to address plaque removal or a statistical improvement in cognitive functioning after plaque removal, till the recent approval. Pfizer, Eli lilly, Merck and many others faced failure in the space. The amyloid theory itself was in question. Biogen’s adacanumab had a peculiar start. The company itself stopped development in 2019, but it surprisingly pursued a high-dose study into 2021. Later, FDA approved adacanumab with an accelerated approval for high-dose version, which faced sharp criticism

Three advisers resigned over the approval of the drug that could have cost $56,000 per annum to administer. However, with a “traditional” approval for Eisai-partnered lecanemab for Alzheimer’s (compared to accelerated approval for adacanumab), Biogen has the first approved treatment, putting adacanumab on the backburner. Cognitive function improvement is a critical marker for Alzheimer’s treatment and lecanemab delivers lower degeneration compared to placebo on this count. The treatment reduced clinical decline by 27 per cent at 18 months on clinical dementia scoring and on daily living scale delivered a 37 per cent improvement compared to placebo

As is evident, the development is satisfactory but a lot more progress is left to be made on Alzheimer’s treatment curve. Takeaways for Investors

Analysing pharma stocks in the US rests on three factors: drugs about to expire, drugs in ramping up stage and the pipeline. With sharp fall post genericisation, drugs about to expire will be a major overhang for any company, without a portfolio in ramping up stages. Pipeline products cannot really offset absence of products in ramp-up stage, as pipeline assets are given lower probabilities of success. Generally, Phase-I/II/III assets get 10/20/50 per cent probability of success

--- Chunk ---
So a good pharma stock should have low impact from expiries and fairly distributed pipeline. Along such lines, we earlier recommended Novo Nordisk (+140 per cent since July-21) and Abbvie (+27 per cent since Oct-21). We reiterate the recommendation on two stocks which are now trading at 31 times and 12 times FY24 earnings. Novo Nordisk, with sales ramp-up in weight loss, pill format and weekly injections of GLP-1RA, is well poised to grow even now. The pipeline will address NASH (untreated liver disease), hematology and other non-diabetic areas as well

Abbvie, despite Humira’s patent loss by end 2023 ($22 revenue billion in 2022) will continue to be powered by Rinvoq and Skyrizi in autoimmune, apart from deep pipeline assets. The Allergan acquisition, funded out of the cash flows from Humira as a replacement for Humira, can cushion the patent loss to an extent. Analyst focus for Merck (12 times FY24 EPS) will start shifting to Keytruda’s likely patent loss in 2028. Despite the overhang, investors can accumulate the stock on dips

The deep pipeline powered by Keytruda combinations in immunology, ADC and other cancers, and the balance sheet strength should support Merck’s stock. While biosimilar launches will impact Keytruda’s sales in 2028, the rate of decline may be lower owing to strong physician preference for Keytruda. Another important aspect to consider is the pipeline valuation. Here’s an example of how it is done. For instance, Biogen (and Eisai’s) Leqembi for Alzheimer’s (AD) is expected to generate peak sales of $7 billion by 2030

It has announced a list price of $26,500 for annual course and we assumed 50 per cent rebate to insurers on average here. Considering the 6 million patients in AD in the US, assuming 50 per cent are mild to moderate (applicable group according to FDA label) and 15 per cent on treatment by year 7, the drug alone can rake in $12 billion (halved to account for Eisai’s share) by 2030 in cumulative sales for a company whose market cap is $33 billion trading at 14 times FY24 EPS

26-year-old with $145,000 in student debt can't afford Christmas. She's giving 'affordable gifts or combining gifts with my older sister'

For Nicole Plauché and her family, Christmas is the time of the year where they can use their preferred love language: gift giving. This year, however, Plauché is worried about how much she can afford to spend on gifts. Her main struggle? Student loan payments. “It just doesn’t leave much room for anything outside of just basic necessities,” said Plauché, a 23-year old tech sales manager from Dallas, Texas

Marisa Johnson, 26, has approximately $145,000 in student loan debt from both her bachelor’s and master’s degrees. Since the COVID-era payment pause ended in October, she’s been paying back $300 a month while she waits to see if she’ll be enrolled in a new income-driven repayment plan. Because all of her money is going to necessities and paying back her student loans, Johnson hasn’t been able to spend as much on gifts as in previous years

“I’ve mostly been trying to think of affordable gifts or combining gifts with my older sister,” said Johnson, a non-profit worker in Citrus Heights, California. Plauché and Johnson are just two of the millions of people who had to start paying back student loans after the Biden administration ended the three-year payment pause. “We know that the holidays are often a very joyful time of the year and an expensive one every year,” said Courtney Alev, consumer financial advocate at Credit Karma

“With federal student loan payments just resuming, it’s going to add another often very significant line item into holiday budgets. ”

If student loan payments are cutting into what used to be your holiday budget, here are some recommendations:

THE PRESSURE IS REAL

From family expectations to social media and TV ads showing lavish gifts, many people feel that the only way they can show love is to spend a lot of money. Between being a mom and a new grad with a salary to match, Plauché says she can barely manage her daily expenses

Still, she feels a responsibility to give her family gifts because that’s how they have traditionally shown each other love. “I don’t want to give my family this message that they’re not loved and it definitely adds a lot of pressure,” she said. Johnson feels guilty because the holidays are the time she feels she can show her family how grateful she is for them. She has always prided herself on being a great gift giver who not only finds something nice but knows how to spot unique and special gifts

“I think I’m a little embarrassed to tell them that this year I might not be able to be a good gift giver,” said Johnson. Acknowledging that you’re feeling pressure is a good first step towards making a plan to set expectations and be realistic about what you can spend. BUDGET

Alev is a big proponent of the 50-30-20 budgeting method, where 50% of your income is allocated for necessities like food and rent, 30% for things you want, and 20% for savings and debt repayment

To find space in your budget for gifts, Alev recommends that you plan ahead as much as possible and only take money from the 30% portion of your budget. If the 50-30-20 is not the right format for you, there are plenty of other budgeting methods that you can use. Whether is recording your spending on an Excel spreadsheet, using an app or writing it down on a notebook, keeping a budget is most effective when you do it in a format that works for you

If you’re experiencing a lot of financial pressure this holiday season, Alev recommends that you try to communicate your feelings to your loved ones. “One of the hardest things is resentment can build up if you feel like you need to buy gifts for your family and you can barely make your student loan payments, so bring things up,” Alev said. Sharing your financial struggles can be hard

If you want to talk but don’t want to share every detail of your financial struggles, that’s okay. Ultimately, what you want is for your loved ones to understand how you’re feeling. Plauché just recently started sharing her money worries with her family. “I have been open with my family, just that I’m not going to be able to give gifts that year,” she said. EXPERIENCES VS. GIFTS

Another great way to save money is to skip material gifts and instead, grant your time. In many cases, your family would rather spend quality time with you

Alev recommended planning low-cost activities such as a hike with your family, or attending a free event in your city. Other options can be a holiday movie marathon with your friends, a free museum with your parents or a volunteering day with your family. USE CREDIT RESPONSIBLY

Since Plauché is already paying her student loan debt every month, she is avoiding using her credit card this holiday season to avoid carrying more debt. If using your credit card is your only option, it’s important that you use it wisely

If you struggle with overspending during the holidays, Alev also recommends setting a budget for each of your credit cards. If you can’t pay your balance in full every month, it’s important that you understand when you payment is due and have a plan to avoid paying a lot of interest. If you’re planning to use “ buy now, pay later services ”, it’s best to be very intentional, Alev said. “It’s easy to get caught up. It’s easy to use it a lot and have several different payments that will come down the road,” she said

There is more than one way to find the “perfect” gift for your family and it doesn’t always involve spending a lot. In her quest to find gifts that don’t cause her financial stress, Johnson has been getting creative. “I’ve definitely been trying to save or just make gifts because I don’t really have the disposable income to buy other people gifts or even buy myself a Christmas gift,” Johnson said

Investment options for high networth investors

India’s remarkable economic growth has resulted in a notable increase in the country’s high-net-worth investors (HNIs). According to recent wealth reports, the population of high-net-worth individuals (HNIs) with assets worth $1 million or more, which was 7. 9 lakh in 2022, will rise to 16. 5 lakh, a 107 per cent increase in five years

--- Chunk ---
The growing number of HNIs, as well as their desire to diversify their portfolios and access opportunities outside of traditional avenues such as stocks, mutual funds, and fixed deposits, has prompted the innovation of existing investment products, leading to the emergence of a new asset class known as ‘Alternatives. ’

Although the same principles of financial and investment planning apply to all investors, HNIs have an advantage. They can choose from a broader range of conventional and unconventional investment opportunities

--- Chunk ---
Investing in unconventional avenues, such as Alternatives, can improve portfolio performance, generate alpha, and allow investors to grow their wealth faster. Let us look at a few examples of such investment opportunities:

1. Alternative Investment Funds (AIFs)

These funds were launched in 2012 after the market regulator SEBI issued guidelines for their management. The guidelines enable AIFs to identify and make investment opportunities available to investors in the public and private markets. AIFs, for example, can invest in listed and unlisted equities via private equity, infrastructure assets, venture debt, stressed assets, start-ups, and so on

--- Chunk ---
As a result, the term “alternatives” came about. The guidelines have divided these funds into three categories to make it easier for investors to understand the fund’s investment objective. These categories are I, II, and III. A noteworthy feature of AIFs is that their returns are generally uncorrelated with publicly traded equity or debt markets, providing a natural hedge against volatility and genuine portfolio diversification. Because of the minimum investment threshold of ₹1 crore, AIFs are only available to HNIs. However, not all funds are required to collect ₹1 crore in a single transaction

--- Chunk ---
They can collect the money in tranches (called drawdowns) over 2-3 years. The drawdown mechanism makes these funds easy on the wallet. AIFs have amassed an AUM of ₹8. 30-lakh crore in the 11 years since their inception, demonstrating the shift of HNI money to this asset. The following are some of the investment opportunities available only to HNIs and presented by AIFs:

a) Start-up funds: Angel investors looking to invest in ideas that have the potential to grow into full-scale businesses can do so through start-up funds, which provide a unique platform for bringing promoters and investors together

--- Chunk ---
These funds handpick start-ups after extensive due diligence and build a portfolio with the potential to multiply capital several times. b) Mid-stage private equity (PE) funds: Investors who are hesitant to take the risk of investing in start-ups can invest in companies in the middle of their evolution cycle. Their business valuations grow exponentially as they mature and enter the late-stage or pre-IPO stage. The mid-stage PE fund allows investors to participate in the growth of such companies. c) Late-stage or pre-IPO funds: Pre-IPO funds allow investors to invest in mature companies preparing to list on the stock exchange

--- Chunk ---
Such funds build a portfolio of companies about to go public and plan to exit them after their anticipated blockbuster listing, which can magnify returns in a relatively short period. Such funds gained immense popularity after the 2020 stock market rally that witnessed the blockbuster listing of some of the popular IPOs of B2C companies. d) Hedge funds: These funds invest in both publicly traded and unlisted stocks. They manage their funds using long-only and long-short strategies, with the latter allowed to use complex derivative techniques to hedge the portfolio

--- Chunk ---
The specialty of long-short funds is that they try to optimise returns in every market situation. Hence, they tend to rise and fall lower than their peers. Investors with stock and mutual fund portfolios can diversify with hedge funds to reduce volatility. e) Performing credit funds: Many operating companies cannot raise funds from banks and NBFCs due to their size or credit ratings. This is where performing credit funds come into play

--- Chunk ---
These funds specialise in credit risk assessment and, after thorough due diligence, offer credit to such companies at relatively higher rates, resulting in higher overall returns than AAA/AA-rated bonds. These funds are attractive for investors seeking higher returns on their fixed-income portfolio, which includes debt funds and AA/AAA-rated bonds. f) Infrastructure Funds: These funds invest in long-term infrastructure assets owned by PSUs or private companies, such as roads, power transmission lines, and solar power plants. Most infrastructure projects provide essential societal services and thus have intrinsic value

--- Chunk ---
These assets generate cashflows in the form of annuities backed by Central and State governments, lowering the risk of future cash flows significantly. These annuities are regularly distributed by funds to the investors, giving them the characteristic of yield. When the fund reaches maturity, the assets may be sold to another fund or infrastructure trust, resulting in capital gains in overall fund returns. g) Venture debt funds: Start-up promoters frequently want to raise money without selling equity. As start-ups, they are unable to approach banks and mutual funds

--- Chunk ---
This is where venture debt funds, which specialise in providing credit to start-ups, come in handy. It goes without saying that such AIFs help these start-ups raise funds at high rates. The higher returns of such funds and risk management appeal to risk-taking, yield-hungry investors. The above fund list is not exhaustive but highlights some of the unique investment opportunities available to HNIs through AIFs. Many more such options are available to investors, such as special situation funds, real estate yield funds, and so on

--- Chunk ---
Along with the investment opportunities presented by AIFs, some other alternatives available to HNIs are:

2. Portfolio Management Services (PMS)

PMS guidelines in India date back to 1993, but this investment avenue has grown in popularity with HNIs recently. The growing financialisation of savings, the formalisation of the economy, and the growing prosperity of tier 2 and 3 cities have resulted in an increase in AUM (excluding EPFO/PF), which stood at ₹5. 28 lakh crore as of July 2023. Because the minimum investment is ₹50 lakh, this option is also only available to HNIs

--- Chunk ---
Both PMS and mutual funds provide expert guidance in navigating volatile markets and seizing investment opportunities that help create wealth. Because mutual funds cater to retail investors, their guidelines are relatively stringent, and compliance is rigorous. Regarding PMS, the investment guidelines are somewhat more flexible, allowing portfolio managers to outperform mutual funds. Another feature that appeals to HNIs is that the beneficial ownership of securities is that of the investors, as opposed to mutual funds, where the ownership is that of the fund. Furthermore, PMS is available in two options: discretionary and non-discretionary

--- Chunk ---
In the former case, the portfolio managers make all decisions; in the latter case, the investor makes all decisions. 3. Market-linked Debentures (MLD)

For HNIs looking to invest a part of their investible surplus in debt, MLDs can be a prudent option. MLDs are non-convertible debt instruments whose returns are tied to a specific financial market benchmark, such as the Nifty 50, the BSE Sensex, or the 10-year G-Sec. The maturity periods of MLDs can vary from one year to five years. Though the minimum investment for MLDs is ₹1 lakh, making it easier even for small investors to invest in them, they are more popular with the HNIs owing to the complex structure of these debentures. MLDs, unlike traditional fixed-income securities, do not provide periodic interest payments before maturity. Income multipliers and principal protection are common features of equity-linked MLDs. In the former case, the MLDs can generate a return that is a multiple of the underlying index’s return. This increases the likelihood of a higher overall return for a more minor market movement

--- Chunk ---
The latter option safeguards the principal (up to the face value of the debenture) in the event of an adverse market movement. This feature allows even investors with a moderate risk tolerance to easily participate in the market. From the discussion above, it is amply evident that HNIs have various alternative avenues to grow their wealth. The distinct value proposition of AIF, PMS, and MLDs, with unique features, distinctive risk-return profiles, and low correlation with traditional asset classes, makes them genuinely deserving of a place in the portfolio of every HNI

Reliance Industries: With the stock having underperformed Nifty 50 in last three years, is it time to buy?

The stock of India’s most valued company, Reliance Industries (RIL), after a decade-long underperformance — from 2007 to 2017 — has managed to treble over the last six years. However, when you look at the stock on a three-year basis, RIL with 11 per cent CAGR returns (including the value of demerged Jio Financial Services), has underperformed Nifty 50 which has delivered CAGR returns of a little over 14 per cent in the same time period

Spanning expansive refining and petrochemicals business, the O2C business performance can be volatile depending on trends in crude oil prices and refining margins. In times of high crude oil prices, higher refining and petchem margins have helped the overall profitability. Similarly, there have been times when, due to falling crude prices, refining and petchem cracker have been on a falling spree, thereby adding to the pressure on the overall profit performance.

WHAT DISCOVERY WON THE NOBEL PRIZE IN CHEMISTRY?

Quantum dots are tiny inorganic particles that glow a range of colors from red to blue when exposed to light. The color they emit depends upon the size of the particle. Scientists can engineer the dots from materials that include gold to graphene to cadmium, and create their color by controlling their size. The tiniest particles, in which electrons are most tightly confined, emit blue light. Slightly larger particles, in which electrons bounce around a longer wavelength, emit red light

Chemists sometimes compare the size of the particle itself to a confining box. The underlying “particle in a box” theory of quantum mechanics was first described nearly a century ago. But it wasn’t until several decades later that scientists could manufacture quantum dots in a lab. In the 1980s, Ekimov, 78, and Brus, 80, honed the theory and developed early laboratory techniques for creating particles that emit varying colors by adjusting sizes

This morning (December 19), the company’s board – now led by Chairman, Rob Naylor – issued a statement announcing that HSF would no longer, as previously expected, be issuing its latest financial results today. Instead, the results (covering the six months to end of September 2023) are now expected to be published sometime before the close of December 31. The reason for the delay? According to UK-listed HSF, it’s all to do with a recently-updated company valuation from HSF’s official independent valuer, US-headquartered Citrin Cooperman (CC)

The HSF board says this valuation from CC was “materially higher than the valuation implied by proposed and recent transactions in the sector”. HSF’s board particularly points to two transactions/would-be transactions as evidence:

The proposed sale earlier this year of assets to Blackstone-backed Hipgnosis Songs Capital for USD $440 million (pre-costs) – or $417. 5 million (post-costs) – a proposal that was ultimately rejected by HSF shareholders; The sale of 20,000 “non-core” songs from HSF’s portfolio to an unnamed buyer (possibly Kobalt Music Group) for $23. 1 million, as announced on December 11

That price, according to HSF’s board, represented a 14. 2% discount on Citrin Cooperman’s valuation of this portfolio as of September 30 (something we’ll come back to). As part of its announcement this morning, the HSF board took something of a swipe at its investment adviser, Merck Mercuriadis‘ Hipgnosis Song Management. After seeing Citrin Cooperman’s latest valuation and believing it to be too high, said HSF, it then “sought advice from Hipgnosis Song Management… which is majority owned by funds managed and/or advised by Blackstone, on their opinion on the independent valuer’s valuation

”

HSF’s board added: “Hipgnosis Song Management… eventually provided an opinion, which was heavily caveated, such that the Board has concerns as to the valuation of the Company’s assets in its interim results. ”

In response, Hipgnosis Song Management issued its own statement today: “Hipgnosis Song Management has fulfilled its duties to [HSF] with respect to both the independent valuation and preparation of the interim results in a timely and efficient manner

--- Chunk ---
“Notwithstanding the Board’s decision to delay publication of the interim financial statements, [we] will continue to work in a constructive manner to support the interests of the Company and its shareholders. ”

The oddest thing about all of this? Citrin Cooperman’s valuation of Hipgnosis Songs Fund is, according to HSF’s own company documentation, appointed and overseen… by the HSF board. See this line, in every annual and interim report from HSF so far (bolding MBW’s own): “Portfolio Independent Valuer… Citrin Cooperman Advisors LLC, formerly Massarsky Consulting, Inc. , [is] appointed by the Board to independently value the Company’s Catalogues within the Portfolio. ”

Not to mention this line in various HSF company reports to date: “The [HSF] Board is ultimately and solely responsible for overseeing the valuation of the Company’s investments in music catalogues and has appointed [Citrin Cooperman] to perform this specialist work. ”

WHAT’S really going on?

It’s a fair bet that Hipgnosis Songs Fund’s board – which last week appointed activist investor Christopher Mills as a non-exec Director – is making something of a ‘hidden’ statement to shareholders with today’s announcement

--- Chunk ---
It may be a coded attempt by HSF’s board to gnash teeth towards HSM/Mercuriadis’ ‘call option’ – which, as MBW has pointed out before, leaves the exec with the exclusive power to sweep in and acquire HSF’s portfolio under several different circumstances. There are a few clues in HSF’s latest public statement to this end, perhaps including its rare – not to mention conspicuous – mention of HSM being “majority-owned by funds managed and/or advised by Blackstone“

--- Chunk ---
In addition, today’s statement is also a clear signal from the HSF board that it has understandable concerns over the now-infamous ‘discount rate’ used by Citrin Cooperman to value HSF’s portfolio (as MBW covered in depth through here). Citrin Cooperman continues to stick to an 8. 5% discount rate in its valuations, despite interest rate rises over the past 12-18 months – and has long refused to move this 8. 5% figure upwards to, say, 9% or 9. 5%. If Citrin Cooperman ever did raise this discount rate, the independent valuation of Hipgnosis Songs Fund’s portfolio would, in turn, instantly fall. Worth remembering: The HSF board has known about Citrin Cooperman’s latest valuation (as of September 30) for at least the past eight days. We know this because, as mentioned, on December 11, HSF announced that the $23. 1 million price of an agreed HSF ‘non-core’ asset sale represented a 14. 2% discount vs. Citrin Cooperman’s latest valuation of the portfolio (i. e. the HSF board had seen this latest valuation)

Yet it took until today (December 19) for HSF to alert its investors to its dissatisfaction with this valuation. WHAT does JP Morgan make of it all?

One of the closest watchers of Hipgnosis Songs Fund in recent years has been JP Morgan and its analyst Christopher Brown. In a rather damning note issued today covering the delay in the publication of HSF’s results, Brown wrote: “This is an early blow to the credibility of the new [Hipgnosis Songs Fund] Board, and casts further doubt over the credibility of the independent valuer, Citrin Cooperman

”

Brown added that he was “surprised” to see that a second valuation expert had not been drafted in to value the HSF portfolio for the latest interim results, especially as Kroll was appointed to consider the “reasonableness” of Citrin Cooperman’s assumptions for HSF’s previous set of results (to end of March 2023). Added Brown: “We think the easiest solution now for the [HSF] Board is to apply an additional discount rate to the [Citrin Cooperman] valuation to reflect current market uncertainty, on the basis that it is probably too late to employ another valuer. ”

Brown noted that a 0. 5% rise in Citrin Cooperman’s discount rate (i. e. raising it from 8. 5% to 9. 0%) would “reduce the fair value of the [HSF] portfolio by 7. 9%, which on a leveraged basis is [approximately a] 10% reduction in NAV [Net Asset Value]”. Should HSF’s board go down this route, he noted, he expected “the [HSF] shares to weaken… given that this represents another ‘unforced error’”

His point: If HSM turned around and said, “yep, HSF’s valuation is 25% too high, better bring it down”, then it would produce a new valuation for HSF that may allow Blackstone (or the Blackstone-controlled Hipgnosis Song Capital) to launch an acquisition bid for the HSF portfolio. (Or, at least, a part of that portfolio. )

The likely price for this hypothetical Blackstone bid would be smaller than the failed $440 million ($418. 5 million post-costs) bid that HSC (via HSM) made for a chunk of the HSF portfolio earlier this year

”

Brown further noted that JP Morgan would “not be surprised to see Citrin Cooperman resign, having been very publicly undermined by the [HSF] Board today”. JP Morgan retained its ‘overweight’ rating against HSF’s share price “in spite of yet another [HSF] own goal”. A Final thought…

As mentioned in the opening sentence of this article, there is plenty of drama surrounding HSF right now – from the ‘discontinuation vote’ we saw at the company in October, through to a recent lawsuit launched against Hipgnosis Songs Fund by a former business partner of Merck Mercuriadis

Such questions will only be answered when Hipgnosis Songs Fund’s board elects to release the company’s six-monthly financial results to end of September 30.

YouTube influencer who gave parenting advice pleads guilty to horrific child abuse

A Utah mother of six who gave parenting advice on YouTube pleaded guilty Monday to child abuse charges and will go to prison for trying to convince her two youngest children they were evil, possessed and needed to be punished to repent. Ruby Franke stood shackled in gray and white jail clothing as she closed her eyes and took a deep breath before pleading guilty to each of her first three charges

On the fourth, she fought back some emotion before saying: “With my deepest regret and sorrow for my family and my children, guilty. ”

Judge John J. Walton scheduled sentencing for Feb. 20 after accepting the plea agreement, which described new details of the abuse the children endured, including the claims that they were possessed. Under the plea agreement, Franke agreed to serve a prison term and the sentences will run consecutively. Sentencing would be up to the judge. Franke pleaded not guilty to two other counts, court records said, and was returned to custody after the hearing

Under Utah law, second-degree aggravated child abuse can be charged if that person knowingly or intentionally inflicts serious physical injury to a child or causes or permits another to inflict serious physical injury to their child. Each charge carries a sentence of one to 15 years in prison. Winward Law said in a statement Friday that the abuse occurred while Franke was influenced by a relationship counselor who led her to “a distorted sense of morality. ”

“Ruby Franke is a devoted mother and is also a woman committed to constant improvement,” Winward Law said in a statement

Franke initially believed that her co-defendant Jodi Hildebrandt “had the insight to offer a path to continual improvement,” but said that Hildebrandt “took advantage of this quest and twisted it into something heinous. ”

In the plea agreement, Franke admits that she tortured her son from May 22 through Aug. 30 by forcing him into hours of physical tasks, summer work outdoors without adequate water and “repeated and serious sunburns” that blistered. He was denied food or given very plain meals, and he was isolated from other people without access to books, notebooks or electronics

After he tried to run away in July, his hands and feet were regularly bound, sometimes with handcuffs. At times, ropes were used to tie together handcuffs that secured his hands and feet as he lay on his stomach, lifting his arms and legs off the ground and injuring his wrists and ankles, the plea agreement said. Franke also admitted to kicking her son while wearing boots, holding his head under water and smothering his mouth and nose with her hands, according to the plea agreement

“He was also told that everything that was being done to him were acts of love,” the agreement states. Franke acknowledged similarly abusing her 9-year-old daughter by forcing her to work outside, run on dirt roads barefoot, and go without food and water. “She was also repeatedly told she was evil and possessed, the punishments were necessary for her to be obedient and repent, and these things were being done to her in order to help her,” the plea agreement said.

In the US, one of the key efforts on that front is being spearheaded by the US Copyright Office, which this past summer issued a call for submissions on the issue of AI and copyright. The goal is for the USCO to put together a study to ”help assess whether legislative or regulatory steps in this area are warranted. ”

Numerous businesses involved in AI, and those with substantial copyright holdings, have submitted their thoughts on the issue, including Universal Music Group and AI developer Anthropic

However, to get the clearest view of the direction the music industry would like to see things head, it might help to read the submission from the National Music Publishers Association (NMPA). The NMPA’s submission, dated October 30, 2023, pulls no punches. It starts off by stressing that its membership – US music publishers major and independent – are “not opposed” to AI. “There is widespread belief in the music industry that great benefits could come from generative AI systems that can assist human creators,” the NMPA states

The submission adds: “Even more alarming is that we do not know how long the window is to act before it is too late. We therefore implore the [US Copyright] Office to support proactive protections for human creators and, where there is uncertainty, to err on the side of protecting human creators. ”

That position might not come as a complete surprise from the NMPA, which earlier this year joined the fledgling Human Artistry Campaign, whose goal – in broadest terms – is to ensure that AI doesn’t replace or “erode” human culture

Here are some of the key arguments the MNPA made in its submission…

Works created principally through AI should not be copyrightable

In the view of the NMPA, simply giving a prompt to a AI music generator – “compose a power ballad about falling in love” – shouldn’t be enough to create a copyrightable work. “Policies surrounding copyrightability of AI-generated content will either serve to incentivize continued investment and effort into human creativity or to disincentivize it,” states the submission, which can be read in full here. “The law should never be such that human creators stand to gain more from repeatedly clicking a button to generate massive amounts of AI-produced materials than from putting their hearts, souls, experiences, skills, talents, and emotions into expressive works of art. ”

The law should treat a musical work created entirely by AI the same way it treats works that are in the public domain, the NMPA argues – not copyrightable, and free for anyone to use as they see fit, whether for commercial or other purposes

But the submission draws a clear distinction between music generated by AI, and music generated with the help of AI. “Where creators use AI technology as a tool in the creative process to make works that represent their original authorship, their works should be entitled to protection under copyright law,” the NMPA states. “Creators that use AI to refine, recast, or modify, or to create new derivative works based on their preexisting works, may also have legitimate claims of authorship over the resulting work in some circumstances

2. AI developers should be required to license materials and keep records of the materials they use for training

However, enforcing copyright when it comes to AI algorithms could be exceedingly difficult for rights holders, a point the NMPA makes repeatedly in its submission: “Reverse-engineering” an AI algorithm to prove it was trained on content to which the developer had no right is no easy task, save for when that AI produces a work that is substantially similar to the original (as in the case of the lawsuits currently pending against AI companies). So the NMPA is arguing for a new regulation: That AI developers be required to keep records of what data their algorithms ingested

The NMPA is opposed to an ‘opt-out’ regime for use of copyrighted works in AI

One of the questions the US Copyright Office posed in its call for submissions was “should copyright owners have to affirmatively consent (opt in) to the use of their works for training [AI], or should they be provided with the means to object (opt out)?”

The NMPA made it clear it’s on the side of “opt in. ”

“US copyright law is an opt-in system,” the NMPA said. “Opt-out regimes fundamentally undermine copyright protections by shifting the burden to obtain a license away from users. ”

The submission continued: “An opt-out scheme that requires rights holders to opt out on an AI company-by-AI company or application-by-application basis would not be feasible, given the sheer volume of AI companies and applications; it is nearly a full-time job to keep up with developments in the AI marketplace… Copyright owners, particularly individual creators and small businesses could not possibly meet such a burden. “NMPA strongly opposes consideration of such a measure. ”

On this issue, the NMPA is fully aligned with UMG, which made a similar argument in its own submission to the Copyright Office. “An opt-out system is based on the erroneous premise that training on copyrighted works without permission is by default lawful unless each copyright owner objects,” UMG stated in its submission. “That philosophy does violence to basic principles of copyright law, imposes undue burdens on copyright owners, creates the wrong incentives for AI developers, and is neither practicable nor effective for protecting the rights of copyright owners or ensuring the sensible use of copyrighted works for training purposes. ”

4. Training AI on copyrighted works is not “fair use” under almost any circumstance

Another area in which the NMPA and UMG are aligned is on the issue of whether using copyrighted material constitutes “fair use

Fair use is the carve-out to copyright law that allows copyrighted materials to be used without permission in certain limited circumstances, such as for educational purposes or for reporting news. First, a quick reminder on the test US courts use to determine fair use, which has four factors:

The purpose and character of the use – is the use of the copyrighted work for educational purposes or for commercial purposes?

The nature of the copyrighted work – whether or not the work is particularly creative and original

The amount and substantiality of the portion taken – just how much of a copyrighted work was used without permission?

The effect of the use on the potential market for, or value of, the copyrighted work. The NMPA’s submission argues that the way AI developers use materials to train AI would fail every one of these tests for determining fair use. AI algorithms are not used for non-profit or educational purposes, as “the training of AI models is fundamentally a commercial endeavor, especially in the case of generative AI,” the NMPA stated. “AI can be used to generate works that compete in the marketplace with the copied works, thereby reducing revenue from existing licensing markets. ” NMPA

Furthermore, it contends that any argument that an AI algorithm was trained on copyrighted material for “noncommercial” or “research” purposes should be “viewed skeptically. ”

Any business could claim it’s training AI for research or non-commercial purposes, “then shift entirely to commercial exploitation, leaving the creators of the copied works with no compensation,” the submission argued

AI training also fails the fair use test on the second factor, as generative AI can be used to create “expressive” works of music, and on the third, given that AI training means the entirety of a copyrighted work is ingested, “although there is no inherent need for that,” the NMPA states. AI training also fails the final test because “AI can be used to generate works that compete in the marketplace with the copied works, thereby reducing revenue from existing licensing markets as well,” the NMPA stated

The issue of fair use could prove to be one of the key battlegrounds between AI developers and copyright holders. In its own submission to the Copyright Office, Anthropic argued that using copyrighted works to train AI is, indeed, fair use.

“In this way, the use of the original copyrighted work is non-expressive; that is, it is not re-using the copyrighted expression to communicate it to users… To the extent copyrighted works are used in training data, it is for analysis (of statistical relationships between words and concepts) that is unrelated to any expressive purpose of the work. ”

“This sort of transformative use has been recognized as lawful in the past and should continue to be considered lawful in this case. ”

The Blueprint of Regeneration: Scientists Discover How to Turn Stem Cells’ Fate

How Do Intestinal Stem Cells Know Their Destiny? What Triggers Stem Cells to Repair Our Intestines? New Research Offers Answers

What Tells Intestinal Stem Cells to Regenerate? New Study Explains

Stem cells have the remarkable ability to transform and replenish dying or injured cells. Yet, the process by which they select their cellular identity in particular scenarios remains a puzzle. The research team led by Bon-Kyoung Koo at IMBA, in collaboration with the Institute for Basic Science, has pinpointed a previously unknown gene, Daam1

This gene is critical for activating the formation of secretory cells in the intestines. This breakthrough, documented in the November 24 issue of Science Advances, heralds a new chapter in the understanding of cancer. Much like automobiles that require constant maintenance to remain operational, our bodies rely on the continual renewal of cells to sustain organ function. Such regeneration is made possible by adult stem cells native to the tissues, which, unlike their embryonic counterparts that can become any cell type, are programmed to only replace the specific types of cells in their respective tissues

Determining how these cells are guided to develop into specific tissue cells has been a key question. Gabriele Colozza, a postdoctoral researcher with Bon-Kyoung Koo at IMBA—currently directing at the Center for Genome Engineering at the Institute for Basic Science in South Korea—took on this challenge by delving into the mechanisms that direct intestinal stem cells. Intestinal stem cells

“In our intestines, cells are exposed to extreme conditions,” comments Colozza. Here, cells face harsh conditions due to factors like mechanical stress, digestive enzymes, and fluctuating pH levels

To counteract this, stem cells within the intestinal lining constantly evolve into new cells to replace those that are damaged. “Uncontrolled stem cell proliferation may lead to tumor formation; on the other hand, if too many stem cells differentiate, the tissue will be depleted of stem cells and ultimately unable to self-renew. ”

This intricate balance is maintained through a complex network of signaling pathways and regulatory feedback loops that enable intercellular communication. A crucial player in this process is the Wnt signaling pathway, a well-established mechanism in embryonic growth. However, without proper regulation, an overstimulated Wnt pathway may result in abnormal cell proliferation and, consequently, tumor development. How Is the Fate of Intestinal Stem Cells Determined?

Rnf43 is a known regulator that tempers the activity of the Wnt signaling pathway, a role initially discovered by Bon-Kyoung Koo. Previously, Rnf43 was recognized for its ability to flag the Wnt receptor Frizzled for destruction. “We wanted to know how Rnf43 works, and also what – in turn – controls Rnf43 and helps it to regulate Wnt signalling,” explains the research team

--- Chunk ---
It was understood from past studies that Rnf43 could not effectively degrade Frizzled by itself, which is embedded in the cell’s plasma membrane. “In our project, we used biochemical assays to identify which proteins interact with Rnf43. ”

They discovered that the protein Daam1 is a crucial collaborator with Rnf43. To probe the influence of Daam1 on Rnf43 and the tissue systems they influence, Colozza utilized intestinal organoids. “We found that Daam1 is required for Rnf43 to be active, so for Rnf43 to regulate Wnt signaling at all. Further work in cells showed Rnf43 needs Daam1 to move the Wnt receptor Frizzled into vesicles called endosomes. From the endosomes, Frizzled is shuttled to the lysosomes where it is degraded, dampening Wnt signaling,” Colozza elaborates. Intestinal organoids, which are three-dimensional cultures derived from adult stem cells, replicate the environment of the intestinal lining. For Colozza, these organoids were a window into how Rnf43 and Daam1 influence the intricate interplay between the renewal and differentiation of stem cells in the gut. “We found that when we knock-out Rnf43 or Daam1, the organoids grow into tumor-like structures

These tumor-like organoids keep on growing, even if we withdraw the growth factors they usually depend on, such as R-spondin,” Colozza notes. What Tells Intestinal Stem Cells to Regenerate? Here’s What a New Study Says

Activating Paneth Cell Development

Upon delving deeper into this research using mouse models, Colozza and team found something unexpected. “When Rnf43 was missing, the intestines grew tumors – as expected. But when Daam1 was missing, no tumors grew. We were puzzled by this striking difference: how can the loss of factors in the same pathway, that behave similarly in organoids, lead to such different outcomes?”

Upon closer inspection of the intestinal samples, the team observed a proliferation of Paneth cells—secretory cells known for producing growth factors like Wnt that prompt cell division—in the intestines without Rnf43. Conversely, intestines deficient in Daam1 showed no such increase in Paneth cells. “Daam1 is required for the efficient formation of Paneth cells. When Daam1 is active, stem cells differentiate to form Paneth cells

--- Chunk ---
When Daam1 is not active, the stem cells differentiate into another cell type. ”

Tumor Growth Influenced by Cellular Environment

This finding helps to explain the contrasting outcomes observed in intestines and organoids. “In organoid culture, we scientists provide growth factors, so the knockout of both Rnf43 and Daam1 lead to tumor-like organoids. But in the intestine, there is no little scientist providing growth factors. Instead, Paneth cells provide growth factors, like Wnt, and create the right conditions for stem cells to survive and divide. When Paneth cells are lacking – such as when Daam1 is not active to drive cells into becoming Paneth cells – stem cells will not divide much. But when there are too many Paneth cells – such as in intestines lacking Rnf43 – the excessive growth factors can contribute to the formation of tumors. ”

The findings from Colozza and his team mark the first genetic evidence that Daam1, associated with the non-canonical Wnt pathway, plays a critical role in designating Paneth cell fate and the evolution of this key secretory cell type

That’s because the container shipping industry, cast as the Grinch that spoiled Christmas over the past two years with record-high freight rates and slow deliveries, is returning to its pre-pandemic place in the corporate world: perennial underachiever Charlie Brown. The biggest carriers posted net income totaling $364 billion in 2021 and 2022, according to figures compiled by industry veteran John McCown, after a decade of scant profits. They’ll likely drift back into the red this quarter as the rates they charge fall below costs and look to stay there for the foreseeable future

Booms-turned-busts have been more abrupt and sensational, but rarely has an established industry so tied to the global economy lurched from historic profits to below break-even levels more directly than the shipping lines that move 80% of the world’s merchandise trade have this year. After Covid’s massive demand shock, the culprit now is too much supply. “I’m certainly concerned about the next 24 to 36 months,” Rolf Habben Jansen, chief executive officer of Hamburg-based Hapag-Lloyd AG, said in an interview last week. “We are going to see a downturn. ”

It can take two to three years to build a container ship, which typically operate for about 25 years. So timing their launch and retirement with the ebbs and flows of the business cycle is inherently difficult. To manage capacity in the short term, the main tools at the carriers’ disposal are canceling individual voyages or suspending services entirely on trade lanes where demand is weak. In prolonged slumps they can also let charter contracts expire, idle some ships or sell old ones in the scrap steel market

Kovatchev said what’s emerging is a standoff between the strong and the weak. “The bigger companies such as Maersk and Hapag-Lloyd have the cash to wait and focus on cost-cutting, as opposed to aggressive capacity reductions — for now,” he said. “It all boils down to supply, demand and who will blink first. ”

Of course, the flipside of shipping’s pain are lower costs for the manufacturers and retailers that own the cargo being transported, which ultimately helps central bankers tasked with bringing down still-elevated inflation across many developed economies

For the container carriers, the cost of moving merchandise can’t stay this low indefinitely, because their expenses are heading in the opposite direction.

OpenAI's ex-chairman accuses board of going rogue in firing Altman: 'Sam and I are shocked and saddened by what the board did'

ChatGPT-maker Open AI said Friday it has pushed out its co-founder and CEO Sam Altman after a review found he was “not consistently candid in his communications” with the board of directors. “The board no longer has confidence in his ability to continue leading OpenAI,” the artificial intelligence company said in a statement

In the year since Altman catapulted ChatGPT to global fame, he has become Silicon Valley’s sought-after voice on the promise and potential dangers of artificial intelligence and his sudden and mostly unexplained exit brought uncertainty to the industry’s future.

As a result, European countries largely followed the “reciprocity principle” that has been written into international copyright treaties such as the WIPO Performances and Phonograms Treaty of 1996: In those countries where artists and labels are paid performance rights, there was no obligation to pay US artists and labels, since European artists didn’t receive those payments from airplay in the US. However, in 2020 the European Court of Justice (CJEU) ruled that the “reciprocity” principle no longer applies to EU member states, even if it exists in copyright treaties and national laws. The court ruled that the European Union’s Rental/Lending Directive of 2006 doesn’t allow EU member states to withhold payments to nationals of non-EU countries. What the failure of the “reciprocity” principle means in practice: US-based artists whose recordings are played on the radio in the EU will be able to collect performance royalties, while EU artists will continue to get nothing from their recordings being played in the US

Because royalties are paid from a collective pool of income, this will reduce payments to European artists by as much as 40% in some countries, the artists’ groups said, as that is the share of US music played on the radio in those countries. IMPALA estimates that the annual loss to EU recorded music rightsholders as a result of “reciprocity” protections not applying in Europe would amount to approximately €125 million (USD $137m) – money which would instead be handed to their US counterparts. “Unless this error is fixed, EU member states will not be able to continue applying the longstanding principle of material reciprocity in the payment of broadcast and public performance royalties on sound recordings from non-EU countries,” the artists’ groups said in a statement issued on Tuesday (November 28). The reciprocity principle “has proven vital in raising the level of copyright protection across the globe for decades,” the statement added. ”A devastating transfer of over €125 million [USD $137 million] every year out of Europe is on the horizon,” IMPALA Executive Chair Helen Smith said this past March

In its 2020 ruling, the CJEU made it clear that the EU legislature has the power to change this by rewriting the directive governing copyright payments. “It is for the EU legislature alone, which has exclusive external competence in the matter, to decide on such a limitation,” the court stated following the ruling. The artists’ groups noted in their statement on Tuesday that the European Commission “has on several occasions acknowledged concerns about the impact of the ruling and made clear its intention to find a balanced solution.

According to the analysis, commissioned by TikTok and carried out by US market monitor Luminate, 62% of US TikTok users pay for a music streaming service, compared to 43% of all consumers. To produce TikTok’s new report, which you can read in full here, Luminate researchers studied data from the US, UK, Germany, Brazil and Indonesia, as well as global data, for a 12-month period from July 1, 2022 to June 30, 2023, and found that “compared to average consumers, TikTok users are significantly more likely to be music streamers”. We know that TikTok counted 150 million users in the United States as of February 2023, which means that, if we look at this stat through the lens of the Luminate analysis, then at this point it appears that approximately 93 million TikTok users in the US are paying for a subscription to one of the various streaming services available in the United States, including Spotify, Apple Music and others

To put into context the number of music subscribers at individual streaming services in the market, we reported in July that as of February, in the United States, Spotify counted 44. 4 million paying subscribers, while Spotify rival Apple Music had 32. 6 million subscribers, and Amazon Music had 29. 3 million subscribers. The new TikTok study looked at consumption data from Luminate Connect, audience insight from the Luminate Music 360 Study, and TikTok engagement volumes provided by the platform in five markets: the US, UK, Brazil, Indonesia, and Germany, as well as globally (see below). Including both paid and ad-supported streaming services, roughly nine out of 10 TikTok users in each market studied used at least one music streaming service. In the US, 89% of TikTok users subscribed to at least one music streaming service, compared to 74% of overall consumers, while in the UK, 85% of TikTok users had a streaming service account, compared to 62% of consumers overall. “In the global and US markets, TikTok user engagement metrics are strongly associated with streaming volumes

In other words, higher TikTok engagement — whether that’s likes, views or shares — corresponds with elevated streaming volumes,” the Luminate report stated. However, TikTok’s impact on music isn’t limited to DSPs. The analysis found that TikTok users are also larger spenders on music off-platform as well. By wide margins, they are more likely to buy merch and attend live shows than the average consumer. In the US, 45% of TikTok users bought music-related merch over a 12-month period, compared to 35% of overall music listeners. Meanwhile, 38% attended a live music event during the year, compared to 33% of overall music listeners. Overall, US TikTok users spent 22% more on music-related purchases, compared to overall music listeners. A similar pattern was found in the four other countries they study looked at. The study also found that the TikTok audience can be an effective marketing tool for artists, as TikTok users, in particular, are considerably more likely to discover and share music than overall social media and short video platform (SFV) users

In the UK, TikTok users were 108% more likely to discover and share music than other social media users, while in Germany, they were 100% more likely. US TikTok users were 71% more likely to discover and share music. “In doing so, TikTok users help both emerging and established artists to reach new audiences,” the Luminate report stated. The study found that TikTok’s platform appears to be a major driver of the glocalization of music – the trend of local artists, performing in local languages, being elevated to a regional or global platform. “TikTok users have a stronger preference for international music than the average music listener,” the report said. “This preference, combined with the high volume of music discovery and sharing activity on TikTok, can be harnessed to grow a fanbase without borders and has helped to launch global artists from genres such as Reggaeton, Afrobeats and K-Pop. ”

The report added: “TikTok users‘ interest in international music is evident in their music streaming preferences

Compared to the average music listener across each market, this audience is more likely to indicate that ‘access to music by global artists’ is an extremely important factor when selecting a music streaming service. ”

“TikTok is already famous for being the launchpad for creating viral hits and breaking new artists, but we wanted to understand how TikTok and its users impact the music industry more broadly,” Ole Obermann, TikTok’s Global Head of Music, said in a statement. “Luminate’s findings prove what we had long known: that TikTok is the driving force behind music discovery in the industry, and that TikTok users are active, engaged and highly valuable drivers of music industry revenues. ”

The new study is part of an ongoing effort by TikTok to highlight its growing role in the development of global music culture. Last year, TikTok released a report asserting that 13 out of the 14 songs to reach number on the US Billboard Hot 100 in 2022 were driven by viral trends on TikTok

Check Point sees 'fantastic' year ahead even as rival report disappointing billings

The financial damage from cybercrimes will reach an astronomical $10. 5 trillion by 2025. As global economies go, that would rank third behind only the U. S. and China. But what’s bad for global conglomerates and the average person could be an opportunity for cybersecurity firms like Check Point Software (NASDAQ:CHKP). Even as rivals like Palo Alto Networks (PANW) and Fortinet (FTNT) cite an uncertain macroeconomic environment for weak billings forecasts, the need for cybersecurity is clearly growing. Global cybercrime damage costs are expected to increase 15% annually over the next two years, according to Cybersecurity Ventures. “There’s never been a better time to be in cyber,” Check Point (CHKP) President Rupal Shah Hollenbeck said in a Zoom interview this week. “It’s fortunate in that organizations are understanding the business value of cybersecurity in a really big way.

However, she stressed operations are normal and business is continuing as usual.

Bolstered by rallies in bitcoin and ether as well as crises at key competitors, Coinbase has been one of Wall Street's best bets all year, climbing more than 250% in the first 11 months of 2023. For early holders of the stock, the rebound helps ease the pain of 2022, when Coinbase lost 86% of its value as soaring inflation and rising interest rates pushed investors out of crypto and high-growth tech companies, and into assets deemed safer in a recession. Tech stocks have roared back this year, particularly those tied to the artificial intelligence boom and crypto

Coinbase has the added benefit of having survived the so-called crypto winter, while so many of its rivals disappeared or downsized. The industry fallout came to a head this month, when Sam Bankman-Fried, founder of former Coinbase rival FTX, was found guilty of seven criminal fraud counts tied to the collapse of his exchange and the theft of customer funds. His conviction landed on Nov. 2 after a monthlong trial. Less than three weeks later, on Nov

Meanwhile, Coinbase executives have floated the idea of leaving the U.

Republicans just dumped Jim Jordan again. They're looking for another speaker candidate

Republican Rep. Jim Jordan failed again Wednesday on a crucial second ballot to become House speaker, the hard-fighting ally of Donald Trump losing even more GOP colleagues who are refusing to give him the gavel. Next steps were highly uncertain as angry, frustrated Republicans looked at other options. A bipartisan group of lawmakers floated an extraordinary plan — to give the interim speaker-pro-tempore, Rep. Patrick McHenry, R-N. C. , more power to reopen the immobilized House and temporarily conduct routine business

What was clear was that Jordan’s path to become House speaker was almost certainly lost. He was opposed by 22 Republicans, two more than he lost in first round voting the day before. “We’ll keep talking to members, keep working on it,” Jordan, a founding member of the hard-right Freedom Caucus, said after the vote, vowing to stay in the race. The House came to another abrupt standstill, stuck now 15 days without a speaker — a position of power second in line to the presidency — since the sudden ouster of Kevin McCarthy

Once a formality in Congress, the vote for House speaker has devolved into another bitter GOP showdown for the gavel. As Republicans upset and exhausted by the infighting retreated for private conversations, hundreds of protesters, if not more, amassed outside the Capitol over the Israel-Hamas war, a stark reminder of the dangers of having the House adrift as political challenges intensify at home and abroad. Ahead of the morning vote, Jordan, the combative Judiciary Committee chairman, made an unusual plea for party unity — almost daring his colleagues to put forward the alternative proposal for a temporary speaker

“We’ve been at this two weeks,” Jordan said at the Capitol. “American people deserve to have their government functioning. ”

But as the roll call got under way, he lost more than he gained, picking up three backers but adding more detractors. No further votes were scheduled. The holdouts added to a surprisingly large and politically diverse group of 20 Republicans who had rejected Jordan’s nomination the day before, many resenting the hardball tactics seeking to enforce support, and viewing the Ohio congressman as too extreme for a central seat of U. S. power

The House had never ousted its speaker before McCarthy, and McHenry could tap the temporary powers that were created after the Sept. 11, 2001, terror attacks to ensure continuity of government. The novel concept of boosting the interim speaker’s role was gaining favor with a pair of high-profile Republicans: Former GOP speakers Newt Gingrich and John Boehner.

Some years ago, Jordan denied allegations from former wrestlers during his time as an assistant wrestling coach at Ohio State University who accused him of knowing about claims they were inappropriately groped by an Ohio doctor. Jordan has said he was never aware of any abuse. ___

(In our report, MBW suggested that YouTube parent Google‘s recent submission to The United States Copyright Office (USCO) – in response to a request for written submissions as part of a study around copyright law and policy issues raised by AI systems – may have influenced Sony’s absence from Dream Track. )

Google was just one of various tech giants and AI companies that submitted responses to the USCO, amongst them, Anthropic and Stability AI. Anthropic, in its submission to the USCO, also argued that training (large language models) LLM’s on copyrighted material is fair use

Stability AI made a similar argument. Its position on the issue of “Fair Use” concerning AI and copyrighted content resulted in the resignation of prominent generative AI executive Ed Newton-Rex from the company. As reported by MBW last week, Universal Music Group submitted its response to the USCO. Unsurprisingly, amongst the highlights of UMG’s submission was the rejection of the notion that using copyrighted material to train LLMs is “fair use”. In his speech on Wednesday, Kooker commented directly on the flurry of submissions to the USCO from the tech industry at the end of October

In what may have been a nod to Google’s filing and “fair use” position, Kooker told Senators that “based on recent Copyright Office filings it is clear that the technology industry and speculative financial investors would like governments to believe in a very distorted view of copyright”. He added: “[That view is] one in which music is considered fair use for training purposes and in which certain companies are permitted to appropriate the entire value produced by the creative sector without permission, and to build huge businesses based on it without paying anything to the creators concerned

Kooker also openly discussed Sony Music’s efforts to get unauthorized AI content removed from platforms online – including the fact that the firm has already issued close to 10,000 separate takedowns. Kooker further discussed Sony Music’s optimism about AI’s potential for enhancing creativity, as well as key principles the company has adopted around generative AI. Here are three things that stood out from Kooker’s speech…

1. Sony Music has issued close to 10,000 takedowns for unauthorized deep fakes of artists

Kooker argued in his speech that, while “the music industry sees great potential with various forms of AI technology in this early phase of AI,” so far, “the available generative AI products are not delivering on the expected promise of new products in creative industries”. He clarified that point by explaining that some generative AI platforms “are not expanding the business model or enhancing human creativity”

Kooker suggested that the “more dire outputs of early generative AI technology are deep fakes and unauthorized voice clones” of artists and that in the United States, “artists are not adequately protected from these deepfakes”. “An artist literally makes their livelihood from their voice,” he said. “Deep fakes intentionally exploit an artist’s talent and reputation to steal that income stream. “Every stream of a deep fake takes streams and royalty payments away from the legitimate artist. Deepfakes are also misleading and confusing to consumers and music fans who are not typically interested in supporting fake versions of their favorite artist

“Every stream of a deep fake takes streams and royalty payments away from the legitimate artist. ” Dennis Kooker, Sony Music

Kooker reported that to date, Sony Music Entertainment has sent “close to 10,000 takedowns to a variety of platforms hosting unauthorized deepfakes that SME artists asked us to take down. ”

He added that “platforms are quick to point to the loopholes in the law as an excuse to drag their feet or to not take the deepfakes down when requested

Kooker commended the No FAKES Act policy drafted by senators earlier this year, which he explained “would create a federal property right in one’s voice or visual likeness and protect against unauthorized AI-generated replicas”. 2. Sony has ‘roughly 200 active conversations taking place’ with AI startups that “include potential equity investments”

Kooker explained that despite the negative impacts of AI, including unauthorized clones and low-quality AI music, there are still “many positive and optimistic developments to highlight”. He highlighted legitimate AI startups and established firms “with music ideas that want to partner with the industry”. According to Kooker, Sony Music has “roughly 200 active conversations taking place with startups and established players” right now about building new AI-related products and tools. These products range from tools for “creative or marketing assistance”, to tools that “potentially give us the ability to better protect artist content or find it when used in an unauthorized fashion” as well as “brand new products that have never been launched before”. Kooker said that some of these conversations “also include potential equity investments which would accelerate the development of these companies”

The Sony Music exec cited, as an example, a recent generative AI-powered project around a reissue and remix of an album. Although Kooker didn’t name it specifically, SME did recently announce a generative AI project with The Orb and David Gilmour, which was a partnership between Sony Music Entertainment, Legacy Recordings AI company Vermillio

“These artists are known for their cutting-edge experimentation in music,” said Kooker. “About the time that we started the discussion with this artist, we had begun informal talks with a generative AI start-up company whose business model focused on working with IP rightsholders the ‘right way’

3. SME has asked Congress to embrace a set of principles around generative AI

Kooker told the lawmakers during his speech on Wednesday that “if copyrights are protected and enforced appropriately, we are at the beginning of a multi-decade marathon that will change the creative and commercial landscape for music”. With that in mind, Kooker explained that Sony Music has established a set of principles to guide the company’s decision-making around generative AI. “If copyrights are protected and enforced appropriately, we are at the beginning of a multi-decade marathon that will change the creative and commercial landscape for music. ” Dennis Kooker, Sony Music

Kooker added later in the speech: “Music is a tremendous driver for AI technology, and AI technology presents a tremendous opportunity for the creative development of music. “But these opportunities must be grounded by the human creators’ vision with the machine assisting, not with the machine replacing the human creator

”

To achieve this, Kooker said that SME wants Congress to embrace the following principals:

Assure Consent, Compensation, and Credit. “New products and businesses built with music must be developed with the consent of the owner and appropriate compensation and credit. It is essential to understand why the training of AI models is being done, what products will be developed as a result, and what the business model is that will monetize the use of the artist’s work. Congress and the agencies should assure that creators’ rights are recognized and respected

--- Chunk ---
” Confirm That Copying Music to Train AI Models is Not Fair Use. “Even worse are those that argue that copyrighted content should automatically be considered fair use so that protected works are never compensated for usage and creators have no say in the products or business models that are developed around them and their work. Congress should assure and agencies should presume that reproducing music to train AI models, in itself, is not a fair use. ” Prevent the Cloning of Artists’ Voices and Likenesses Without Express Permission. “We cannot allow an artist’s voice or likeness to be cloned for use without the express permission of the artist. This is a very personal decision for the artist. Congress should pass into law effective federal protections for name, image, and likeness. ” Incentivize Accurate Recordkeeping. “Correct attribution will be a critical element to artists being paid fairly and correctly for new works that are created. In addition, rights can only be enforced around the training of AI when there are accurate records about what is being copied

Otherwise, the inability to enforce rights in the AI marketplace equates to a lack of rights at all, producing a dangerous imbalance that prevents a thriving ecosystem. This requires strong and accurate record keeping by the generative AI platforms, a requirement that urgently needs legislative support to ensure incentives are in place so that it happens consistently and correctly. ” Assure Transparency for Consumers and Artists. “Transparency is necessary to clearly distinguish human-created works from AI-created works.

Added Kooker: “While these principles are simple and basic, they require a new level of commitment and investment from generative AI platforms. “If established early on, they will result in an even playing field for all participants so there will not be an unfair competitive advantage for a few at the expense of future innovators. “The principles will ensure that intellectual property businesses can succeed in this new world alongside tech partners, further advancing investment and expanding economic opportunities. “Music Business Worldwide

‘Fair use’ is, as it sounds, the argument that there are cases where copyrighted material can be used and even replicated that are, well, fair enough. A clumsy example: I read a great book, then I meet you for breakfast, where I tell you about the story and quote a couple of my favorite passages to you. To suggest I’ve just committed copyright infringement wouldn’t only be silly – it would mean that copyright protections were getting in the way of the commercial furtherment of the author/rightsholder (i. e. you might go and buy the book on my recommendation)

MBW’s sources close to Sony Music were keen to point out that the company’s general ongoing relationship with YouTube and YouTube Music is a harmonious one. (YouTube is, after all, now the second largest commercial partner of the major record companies – with a stated ambition to catch up with Spotify in the years ahead. YouTube says it paid out over USD $6 billion to music rightsholders in the year to end of June 2022, with around $2 billion of that coming just from ads on user-generated content

However, the October US Copyright Office filing from Google has definitely put the cat amongst the pigeons at Sony Music HQ. As we’re sure it has at the other two major record companies. “Any prohibition or limitation on the use of copyrighted materials for purposes of Al training would undermine the purpose of copyright and foreclose the many opportunities that come with this technology. ” Google filing with the US Copyright Office, October 30

Witness Universal Music Group’s own filing with the US Copyright Office on the topic of AI. It couldn’t offer a starker contrast to Google’s assertion that “prohibition or limitation on the use of copyrighted materials for purposes of Al training would undermine the purpose of copyright and foreclose the many opportunities that come with this technology”.

As well as part-explaining Sony Music’s refusal to be included in ‘Dream Track’ thus far, Google’s USCO filing also perhaps explains the careful words selected by Robert Kyncl and especially Sir Lucian Grainge in their respective comments endorsing YouTube’s AI experiment. (Grainge’s statement, remember, began: “We have a fundamental responsibility to our artists to ensure the digital ecosystem evolves to protect them and their work against unauthorized exploitation, including by generative AI platforms…”)

GROWTH THROUGH TRADE AND INVESTMENT

The Philippine Development Plan (PDP) 2023-2028 aims for a deep economic and social transformation to reinvigorate job creation and accelerate poverty reduction by steering the economy back to a high-growth path. In this regard, two main performance indicators are identified and will be monitored by the National Government. The first is for the country to graduate into upper middle-income class status within the term of the current administration

For this, the economy must grow its per capita income above the threshold set by the World Bank, which means a gross national income (GNI) per capita of at least $4,466. In 2022, the Philippines achieved a GNI per capita of $3,950. The second is to lower the poverty level from 18. 1% in 2021 to single digits by 2028 — the end of the term of the current administration. Both indicators require high growth rates. For the next year through 2028, the government pencils the growth rate between 6. 5% and 8%

This plan gradually narrows the deficit to 3% of GDP by 2028, down from 7. 3% in 2022, such that the debt-to-GDP ratio is reduced from nearly 61% in 2022 to a more sustainable level of at most 53% by 2028

DEBT MANAGEMENT

The National Government’s debt was less than 40% before the pandemic struck. It expended much of its fiscal space combatting the pandemic, incurring debt and large budget deficits. While the current 61% debt-to-GDP ratio may be manageable for an emerging economy like the Philippines for some time, the country may not have the fiscal space to respond to another potential domestic or external shock. If the debt continues to rise more than the economy, risks will increase, and the government may “crowd out” private investment as it competes with the private sector for funds to service its debt

The planned fiscal consolidation entails harmonizing the revenue needs with the promotion of investment through the structure and administration of the reformed incentive system. The National Government plans to raise more revenue to finance the country’s socio-economic needs, largely through a progressive and simplified tax system, more efficient and effective tax collection measures through digitalization and, to some extent, from policy measures such as value-added tax on digital service providers and excise tax on sweetened beverages and junk food. Achieving fiscal stability presupposes the sustainability of fiscal policy, and fiscal stability helps “crowd in” private investment

PRICE STABILITY AND INFLATION

In his second State of the Nation Address (SONA), President Ferdinand Marcos, Jr. singled out inflation as the country’s most pressing problem. In the first nine months of 2023, inflation averaged 6. 6% — far above the upper end of the target range of 2-4% set by the BSP. If left unchecked, inflation could undermine growth. Not only does this increase costs to organizations, but it also sets in motion second-round effects as workers start demanding higher wages, consequently increasing business costs and discouraging investments

Inflation is partly driven by supply-side issues and the government is allocating more resources to the agriculture sector to boost production. Mr. Marcos also mentioned that the National Government had distributed 28,000 new tools and machinery to farmers. An additional 600 km of farm-to-market roads were laid down to support the 14 million hectares of farmland, enhancing farmer access to markets. In addition, he signed Executive Order No. 28 in May, forming the Inter-Agency Committee on Inflation and Market Outlook, which is tasked to keep inflation within government targets and boost the economy

ENHANCING CLIMATE RESILIENCE

While price stability and fiscal sustainability are important macroeconomic issues, environmental sustainability is increasingly gaining importance. Climate change uncertainties and challenges need to be managed and both the Philippine government and the private sector are hard-pressed to deliver their commitments to addressing them. Despite climate change risks, the Philippines has the opportunity to position itself as a prime destination of foreign investments against climate change or environmental, social, and governance (ESG) investments. The government calls for embedding resilience, sustainability, and nature-based solutions in infrastructure planning and investment to enhance climate resilience

Billie Jean King sees progress in her crusade for more investment women’s sports: 'We’re kind of at a tipping point'

Billie Jean King is still globetrotting in support of more investment and equity in women’s sports.

Talk about that whirlwind. KING: We started the WTA four days before Wimbledon. I won all three titles at Wimbledon, which for me was a big deal.

The Irish have been pressing for a ceasefire for a long time and I explain to them that if we had taken their advice and stopped firing then little Emily Hand would still be in captivity, and if we take their advice now to agree to a ceasefire then Hamas will commit more atrocities, because it will feel empowered and it will come out of this war with a feeling that the world has its back

In recent weeks Levy, and all Israel's spokespeople and volunteers in the National Public Diplomacy Directorate, headed by Moshe Aviv, have been working around the clock. "We try to be available 24/7. Last Friday I was interviewed at six in the morning and I finished with a CNN interview the following morning at 2am.

The world does not make life easy for Israel's spokespeople, to say the least, compared with the ease with which the Hamas narrative is adopted

"I remember an interview the day after the bluff about the Al-Ahli hospital, which the Palestinians claimed had been hit by an Israeli missile, killing 800 civilians, but in the end it turned out that it was actually by a splinter group of Islamic Jihad, and that no hospital was destroyed and certainly not 800 people were killed. I explained to them in Sky News that Hamas lies and makes up numbers and the reporter asks me almost speechless with surprise, if I doubt Hamas' numbers. "

Levy describes these moments as intensely frustrating

He recounts, "In a BBC interview, the interviewer told me 'Hamas denies what you are saying,' and you see the frustration on my face when I tell her that of course Hamas denies this. Hamas denies that it is even holding hostages. Hamas massacres, beheads, rapes, burns families, and then, day and night, denies that it did this.

Two months now, Levy has been fighting in this arena with the tools at his disposal. "We are fighting to make it clear to the world that the information coming out of Gaza comes either directly from Hamas or from independent reporters and photographers that are part of the system in Gaza. Everyone knows that even if they are not affiliated with Hamas, they are not free to present the full truth, because they are not allowed to

There is not a single photo of a terrorist, there is not a single photo of a missile being launched from a densely populated area, from a mosque or a school, not even a single photo from the Hamas tunnels under Shifa. Why? Because these reporters, even if they are not explicitly on the side of Hamas, operate under a dictatorial regime and cannot provide the information even if they wanted to. And it is very important to continue reminding the world how much the information that reaches them is biased and does not reflect reality

Despite all this, Levy feels he must stress that not everyone is against us. "I don't want to give the impression that all the interviewers are hostile and every question is delusional. Absolutely not. I have many interviews with reporters who understand what is happening here and simply want to get information and hear the Israeli side, which is completely legitimate. "

The UK is currently in the headlines over anti-Israel and pro-Palestinian demonstrations and antisemitism. Did you encounter antisemitism in your childhood there?

"I did not personally experience antisemitism but I was exposed to it during debates and every time there was a round of fighting I found myself defending Israel's position. "

One of the most significant occasions on which Levy was defending Israel was in 2013, when he was an undergraduate at the University of Oxford, and was conducting a debate with British MP George Galloway on his remarks about Israel

That was a moment that reverberates for Levy when he sees what is currently happening in universities around the world.

In 2014, on completing his master's degree in international relations at the University of Cambridge, Levy found himself at the crossroads that led him to Israel: "One option was to study law and work as a lawyer in London, and the other option was to go on a Zionist adventure. That summer I was on the March of the Living and I remember myself standing wrapped in a flag and crying, realizing that a decision had been made.

The decision was made just as Operation Protective Edge (2014) began. "I wanted to enlist to help in the war. It was the scariest experience in my life. I remember a child who looked out the window and said, 'Dad, I think I saw a missile. '"

So how does that all fit together - one day you are at a demonstration against the government and the next day you are its spokesperson?

"Like many, I participated in the protests against the reform. It's no secret. There was Israel before October 7 and there is Israel after. Nothing will return to what it was before. There is now only one task: to win the war, and for that we must put the wars of the Jews aside and unite. "

"It's so ridiculous what we argued about and what we pulled our hair out over for before October 7, a date that reminds us all of the big picture, why we are here, why we owe each other and in the end also love each other.

Fundamental Investing: The Art of Relative Valuation

The PE (price to earnings ratio) of a stock is 18. Is that cheap or expensive? Well, it depends. On what? Many things! Welcome to the world of relative valuation. The findings from research done a decade earlier by Aswath Damodaran indicated that around 85 per cent of valuation done by equity research analysts and 50 per cent of corporate M&A transactions were based on relative valuation. So, what exactly is this relative valuation?

It is the art of attempting to determine the fair value of a stock based on how it is valued relative to many factors. So, whether the PE of a stock is 15 or 18 or 30, the only way you can make an assessment of whether it is cheap or expensive is by analysing this one number — against its growth prospects, peer company multiples, industry trading range, historical average PE, the prevailing interest rates, etc

However, due to a combination of complexities involved in building appropriate models, insufficient information, time constraints and also the fact that there are hundreds of stocks you want to consider, it is just not possible to do a DCF ( discounted cash flow model) for all your stock investments, and hence relative valuation as an approach to picking stocks too is well accepted and widely prevalent. When you decide to buy or sell a stock based on its PE or P/B or EV/EBITDA or EV/Revenue or even EV/subscriber ratios, you are engaging in the art of relative valuation

In simple words, one way to understand the difference between absolute valuation (explained in last week’s edition) and relative valuation is this – absolute valuation is made up of an interesting story that is backed by credible and validated numbers, while relative valuation is made up of an interesting number backed by a credible and validated story. What are those numbers in relative valuation? Every number in relative valuation is the result of a number A divided by a number B. For example, PE is price of the stock divided by its earnings

--- Chunk ---
These are all numbers that are used to compare against similar metrics of other stocks and assess the merits of the stock. Before we proceed on using relative valuation to pick stocks, it is important to understand that you can do relative valuation using equity multiples or firm/enterprise multiples. Equity multiples

If you check the balance sheet of any company, the liabilities side is primarily made up of two line items — shareholder funds and borrowings

--- Chunk ---
To the contrary, a Profit and Loss statement has many line items — starting with revenue, followed by variable costs and then fixed costs and taxes. The only claim that equity shareholders have for distribution or for appropriation amongst themselves is what is left after paying the taxes — net profit. So, if you are doing relative valuation based on equity multiples, it is important to ensure you divide the equity – ie price per share or market cap of the company by line items that apply to equity shareholders

--- Chunk ---
Based on this, there are only 3 items that can be attributed to equity shareholders — net profit from P&L statement, book value or shareholder funds from the Balance Sheet, and the free cash flows to equity (FCFE) from the cash flow statement. Any relative valuation multiples will be linked to these three items one way or the other. Any other metric could be wrong and misleading. For example, price by revenue or price by EBITDA is incorrect

--- Chunk ---
Why? How do you differentiate between two companies A and B — both having same market cap of ₹100 and similar in all means except for debt levels — same revenue (₹100) and same gross margin and same EBITDA margins of 20 per cent and thus same EBITDA of ₹20. But A has zero debt, while B has debt of ₹10. Since revenue or sales and EBITDA are same, if you do a market cap/revenue or Price /Sales, or marketcap/EBITDA, both companies will have the same valuation
--- Metadata ---

--- Chunk ---
However, let’s assume depreciation is ₹10, interest cost is 10 per cent and taxes are zero. This means the net profit of A is ₹10, while that of B is ₹9. Thus although both companies are similar in terms of Price/Revenue and Price/EBITDA, A is cheaper on the PE ratio – ie PE of A is 10 and PE of B is 11. 1. On a relative valuation basis, you must choose A instead of B, but you would not have spotted it if you had used incorrect metrics. Hence it’s very important to use the right multiples

When it comes to equity metrics, it always has to be price or market cap (or variations of the same) in numerator divided by line items attributable to equity holders (or variations of the same)

The accompanying table gives the commonly used equity multiples for relative valuation. Once the metrics and importance are understood, there are, as such, no limits to how you can use them to pick stocks. You can use one or two metrics or a combination of many more metrics to assess which stocks are undervalued or overvalued

--- Chunk ---
Depending on specific cases, you can use further variations to pick stocks. For example, during the 2003-2007 bull market, many textile stocks, for instance, Bombay Dyeing, turned out to be multibaggers. Was their textile business booming? Not really. But the stocks were zooming because there was real estate boom and many textile mills had manufacturing facilities in prime real estate locations. So the markets started to factor value of the company based on market value of their land. In such a case you can deviate from Price/Book multiple to price/market value of net assets (assets – net debt)

--- Chunk ---
Similar is the case with holding companies. If you think there is a reasonable case for underlying value of assets to be unlocked and Holdco discount to shrink, like it has happened in bank holding companies in the last 2-3 years, then there is a case to move beyond book value to market value. Enterprise value multiples

Enterprise value refers to total value of a company/business. This total value as perceived by the market is represented by the sum of its market cap + net debt (includes minority interest)

--- Chunk ---
What works in the case of EV is that it helps in doing a capital-agnostic analysis of a company. Whether a company is funded only with equity, or a combination of equity and debt, the total value of the business is the same. Sources of funding don’t matter. Using EV, the value of equity (share price) is derived from the value of the business. Since the capital structure of companies varies significantly, an EV approach enables valuing them on similar terms

--- Chunk ---
One can arrive at the value of the business first and then subtract net debt, to arrive at the equity value. The advantage with EV-based metrics is that you have more options to value a company. Bear in mind, valuation accuracy is better the lower down the P&L and cash flow statement one can get to. But there are many times when company profits are low, but its operational performance ie EBITDA is not bad.

For example, take the case of Bharti Airtel: at the start of FY22 (April ‘21) its trailing PE was negative/invalid due to losses in FY21. The stock would have been avoided if one went by PE alone. However, on trailing EV/EBITDA basis, it was trading at 10 times EV/EBITDA. When this was considered against its estimated next 2 years EBITDA CAGR of over 20 per cent, the valuation, combined with qualitative factors, made it an interesting buy. Since then, net profits have improved substantially as operating leverage played out. At bl

Where even EBITDA multiples are not clear, as was the case with many new-age company IPOs that were reporting losses even at the EBITDA level, investors have no option but to go further up the P&L to metrics like EV/revenue, or even outside of P&L to use metrics like EV/subscriber. As we mentioned earlier, relative valuation represents a number backed by a credible and well-validated story. Hence, you can use non-P&L multiples. So when you compare companies and invest in one based on EV/Subscriber, there must be a credible story backing future monetisation of the subscriber in a profitable manner

But do bear in mind, the risks are higher and so may be the rewards or pain as the case may be. When the risks are higher, you must apply a higher margin of safety before choosing the stock. Another thing to bear in mind when it comes to EV-based valuation — any change in EV will impact only the equity value. For example, if EV of a company is ₹100 and it has ₹50 in debt, then the value of its equity is ₹50

In this case, if you think EV can increase by 10 per cent, the value of equity will increase by 20 per cent, and the reverse is also true. The higher the leverage, more the impact of change in EV on the value of the stock (both ways). Keep a weather eye on Ketchup Economics

Given the fact that relative valuation is based on comparison with peer multiples, investors must take measures to check whether the peer multiples are reasonable as well. An overvalued peer cannot be used to justify expensive valuation in one stock

This is what economist Larry Summers termed as Ketchup economists/economics. It was his sarcastic take on some of the highly paid economists and finance professionals who are concerned only with inter-relationships between prices of different financial assets. Based on this approach, they conclude whether the price of an asset independently is efficient or not. If two bottles of ketchup sell for twice as much as one bottle (except for minor differences traceable to transaction costs), the market is efficient. The risk in this – it ignores the aspect of whether one bottle of ketchup is priced rationally

So, what can you do to avoid pitfalls while using relative valuation? Here are a few pointers. One, after comparing stocks based on relative valuation, you can do more layers of comparison by assessing how their valuation fares relative to growth prospects

--- Chunk ---
This apart, many other factors can justify different valuations. For example, TCS has always commanded a valuation premium to peer stocks like Infosys, Wipro and HCLTech because of its superior margins and much more consistent growth. So just because the other stocks are cheaper on PE basis does not mean they are cheap compared to TCS. So you can also do one more layer of comparison by assessing each company’s valuation against its long-term (5-10 years) mean and median valuations and assess how they fare relative to their own history. Two, equity valuations do not function in a silo

Investors have many options — fixed deposits, bonds, real estate, etc. When other assets get more attractive one must assess scope for valuation change in equities as well. For example, interest rates and bond yields in many developed markets, including the US, are at their highest levels since 2007. This means investors may have to assess current valuations not just against last 10 years’ valuations, but of prior periods as well

Why? Near zero interest rates and low bond yields made stocks with earnings yield of mere 1-2 per cent attractive for an FPI — for example stocks such as Asian Paints, Nestle India and ABB India which today trade at PE of 65, 83 and 85 times respectively. This implies earnings yield of 1. 5 per cent for Asian Paints and 1. 2 per cent for Nestle and ABB. Such earnings yields of these stocks were fine for FPIs to hold when compared to zero interest income in their domestic market

--- Chunk ---
But now, with US bond yields offering 5 per cent, these may not be so attractive even when considering the growth prospects. While Indian interest rates were always higher, investors in equities benefited from the global investors’ hunger for yields. That advantage is diminishing today. This is not a recommendation on the stocks, but pointers on factors to consider to make your relative valuation process more foolproof. With discipline and experience, the process will keep getting better

Movie theaters are readying for an onslaught like they’ve never seen before, beginning Friday when “Taylor Swift: The Eras Tour” debuts. The concert film, compiled from several Swift shows at Southern California’s SoFi Stadium, is expected to launch with $100 million, or possibly more. Advance ticket sales worldwide have already surpassed $100 million. Swifties will descend. Dancing will be encouraged. “This is different,” says Marcus. “Take your phone out. Take selfies. Dance, sing, get up, have a good time. We want to create an atmosphere. ”

Concert films, of course, aren’t anything new

Just last month, the Talking Heads classic “Stop Making Sense” returned to theaters for a decades-later encore. But “The Eras Tour” heralds something new and potentially game-changing in the movie industry. Two of the biggest stars on the planet — Swift and , in December under a very similar arrangement, Beyoncé — are heading into cinemas in first-of-their-kind deals made directly with AMC Theaters that circumvent Hollywood studios and which, for now, leave streamers waiting on the sidelines

But how did the once declared-for-dead multiplex become the go-to place this fall a pair of stars previously at home on Netflix?

When studios began diverting some of their titles to streaming platforms, movie theaters began thinking harder about how they could fill their screens — a question exacerbated this autumn by an actors strike that’s led to the postponement of big releases like “Dune: Part Two. ”

BTS earlier this year released a concert film, with higher ticket prices and limited showtimes. The Metropolitan Opera has for years done popular live broadcasts in theaters.

Most wide-release movies open with Thursday showings and Friday daytime screenings. It’s another wrinkle in a nontraditional release that’s challenging Hollywood norms

Robot startups see huge market in replacing human workers: 'We can sell millions of humanoids, billions maybe'

Building a robot that’s both human-like and useful is a decades-old engineering dream inspired by popular science fiction. While the latest artificial intelligence craze has sparked another wave of investments in the quest to build a humanoid, most of the current prototypes are clumsy and impractical, looking better in staged performances than in real life.

Tesla CEO Elon Musk is also trying to build a humanoid, called Optimus, through the electric car-maker’s robotics division, but a hyped-up live demonstration last year of the robot’s awkwardly halting steps didn’t impress experts in the robotics field.

Sanctuary’s newest and first bipedal robot, Phoenix, can stock shelves, unload delivery vehicles and operate a checkout, early steps toward what Rose sees as a much longer-term goal of getting robots to perceive the physical world to be able to reason about it in a way that resembles intelligence.

Agility’s Digit robot caught Amazon’s attention because it can walk and also move around in a way that could complement the e-commerce giant’s existing fleet of vehicle-like robots that move large carts around its vast warehouses. “The mobility aspect is more interesting than the actual form,” said Tye Brady, Amazon’s chief technologist for robotics, after the company showed it off at a media event in Seattle. Right now, Digit is being tested to help with the repetitive task of picking up and moving empty totes

With hopes of victory fading, Ukraine's fight against Russia could get even harder in 2024

At the start of 2023, hopes were high that a much-vaunted Ukrainian counteroffensive — expected to be launched in the spring — would change the dial in the war against Russia. It didn't, and the prospect of a breakthrough in 2024 is also unlikely, military experts and defense analysts told CNBC. They predict intense fighting is likely to continue into the next year but say Kyiv's forces are unlikely to launch any more counteroffensives. Russia, meanwhile, is likely to focus on consolidating the territory it has already seized, particularly in eastern Ukraine. Away from the battlefield, military experts said that the trajectory the Russia-Ukraine war takes in 2024 will mostly be dictated thousands of miles away in the U. S

And, as you're seeing things now, if you really think about it, what has been achieved this year? Very little has been achieved by Russia, and you can say the same thing for the Ukrainians," he said

"We're in this situation now where if there's not a clear winner, there's going to be a stalemate, and there's going to be, perhaps, a future frozen conflict. What can tilt the balance, in my view, is if the Ukrainians are not resupplied and they're not re-funded and they don't get the equipment and people that they need. Then this war could tilt to the Russians," Twitty noted

Expectations not met

A year ago, Ukraine's international military support was solid with NATO pledging to support Kyiv for "as long as it takes" as it defended itself against Russia's invasion launched in February 2022. Over the summer, however, the challenge facing Ukraine's forces was glaringly obvious as they struggled to break through heavily fortified Russian positions and lines of defenses along a swathe of the 600-mile-long front line across the southern and east of the country

Specifically, all eyes are on former U. S. President Donald Trump, the Republican front-runner, who cultivated close relations with his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin during his presidency. There are concerns that, given Trump's previous good relations with Moscow and "America First" policy, aid for Ukraine could be shelved rapidly. Defense analysts agree that much of the outlook for Ukraine is dependent on the outcome of the U. S. vote. "I think it's important to understand the extent to which Ukraine is reliant on the U.

Rumblings of discontent over continuing Ukraine aid have been heard in some Republican quarters for months now, as well as in Eastern Europe. Former U. S. Ambassador to NATO Kurt Volker told CNBC he believes American and EU aid packages for Ukraine will be approved come January, saying he believed this funding would tide Ukraine over for another year, militarily

Volker said that aid packages must include more advanced weaponry for Ukraine, however, like F-16 fighter jets which have been pledged by Norway, Denmark and the Netherlands. Ukrainian pilots are beginning their training on the jets now but it could be a number of months before they're deployed in Ukraine. The U. S. is not providing F-16s to Ukraine but has authorized allies to provide their own jets. "A couple of things ought to change," Volker told CNBC. "We ought to lift restrictions on the weapons we're providing. We still don't provide the longest-range missiles and we still have not delivered any Western aircraft in Ukraine yet. Those things have to happen. And I think we have to try to give the Ukrainians more of a technological advantage," he noted.

Volker believes that a Trump presidency might not be the catastrophe for Ukraine that is feared, but said it would make future funding uncertain

Ukraine's Defense Ministry said last week that its main goal in 2024 is to boost its domestic defense industry in the face of uncertain future supplies from its Western allies.

In recent months, Warner Music Group CEO Robert Kyncl has been keeping a close eye on AI in the music industry – not surprising, given that he came to the music biz from ‘Big Tech’, namely YouTube, where he was Chief Business Officer. Nor is it surprising, given his current role, that he has been pushing for price hikes at music streaming services. Both of these topics came up during Kyncl’s Q&A session at the Code Conference in Laguna Niguel, California, on Tuesday (September 26)

But what was maybe more surprising – for a techie like Kyncl, anyway – was his rational, level-headed explanation for why traditional music labels continue to be relevant, and continue to thrive, in the current music ecosystem. With the arrival of digital platforms, including open ones like YouTube and SoundCloud – and with the proliferation of indie music distribution platforms like DistroKid and TikTok’s SoundOn – it’s inevitable that music biz observers from the world of tech like to speculating about the possibility that music labels could, in the long-term, be headed for irrelevance

In a world where anyone can record music using a desktop audio workstation (DAW) and upload it direct to YouTube, or to Spotify via a distribution platform, labels have little left to do, the argument goes. Kyncl offered strong a counterpoint to this argument at Code Media, drawing a parallel between music labels today and the advertising industry a decade or two ago. At that time, he said, many predicted ad agencies were headed for the scrap-heap thanks to the arrival of Google’s AdWords, which allowed any business to set up a customized ad campaign on Google services

Yet ad agencies didn’t go extinct. Today, “they’re the largest customers of companies like Google,” Kyncl told the audience at the Code Conference. “In the year 2000, when AdWords came out, everybody was predicting their deaths because all the brands [could] just go direct to AdWords and buy ads… However, what happened was lots of different platforms emerged. Lots of ad tech emerged, complexity increased exponentially, and brands needed help with that, and the agencies provided that value. “And I see a very close analogy [between that and] our business. Music is incredibly broadly distributed

Everybody on earth listens to music. We’re on every platform. And the complexity is high. And the more people can upload content, and the more people can be heard, the greater the noise, which means it’s harder to cut through the noise and sustain a career. ”

But a label’s value is not just about building an artist’s career – it’s about sustaining it once that career is established as well, Kyncl explained. “When they become established, it is also hard to remain at the top,” Kyncl said. “So their goals change. And again, we’re there to help with that

So it digitizes first,” he said. “Whatever happened to the music industry 20 years ago is starting to happen in the movies and TV shows now. In the meantime, music emerged out of [digitization] better and stronger and more resilient. So, I would imagine the same will happen here, which is we’ll likely be first

Asked when that sea change will occur, Kyncl said: “I would say within the next year you will see lots of evolution around AI… What you will likely see is increasing quality at a very fast pace. ”

Kyncl drew an analogy between the explosion of AI use among members of the public and the explosion of user-generated content (UGC) a decade or two ago. Just as user-generated content often infringed on copyright, so too does AI threaten the rights of artists and music rights holders

In Kyncl’s view, the solutions put in place to address UGC form a “blueprint” than can be used to address AI-generated content on platforms as well. “When YouTube was formed… people started to upload content, including copyrighted material, which, obviously, put YouTube into hot water with lots of different copyright holders

Kyncl was referring to YouTube’s Content ID system, which scours uploaded videos for copyrighted content (video and audio), then offers the copyright owner the option to monetize that video, or to request that it be taken down. The innovative system has essentially allowed YouTube users to upload content without paying much attention to copyright, while ensuring that copyright owners are paid. When it comes to the proliferation of AI, “we need to approach it with the same thoughtfulness, and we have to make sure that artists have a choice,” Kyncl added

From FAPE/PEAC to PhilEd

We recently presented a paper at the 5th Paderanga-Varela Memorial Lecture entitled “Alternate Service Delivery Systems: Health and Education. ” In that lecture, we looked at the Department of Health (DoH) and the Department of Education (DepEd) as service delivery systems, delivering healthcare and education respectively. We concluded that the service delivery system of the DoH is far superior to the DepEd for two main reasons. The first is that the DoH has devolved its hospitals to the local government units while the DepEd has not

--- Chunk ---
Secondly, the DoH has spun off its health financing into the Philippine Health Insurance Corp. (PhilHealth) while the DepEd has not. In this article we argue for the creation of the Philippine Education Development Fund (PhilEd). When Isidro Consunji, President of DMCI Holdings, Inc. was asked by his officers what the role of his Chief Financial Officer (CFO) would be, he gave a three-word answer, “Fund my dreams. ”

Likewise the role of PhilEd would be to fund the education dreams of all Filipinos especially the neediest and most deserving. Filipinos have three dreams in education

--- Chunk ---
The first is to enroll in a chosen course in the school of their choice. This dream will be funded by the School Vouchers Program which will now be transferred from DepEd to PhilEd. The second dream, especially for Filipino parents, is to save enough money to fund the college education of their children, hence the prevalence of pre-need Educational Plans. Unfortunately, most of the pre-need companies went into bankruptcies causing financial ruin and emotional distress to their plan holders. There has been a massive market failure and so government must intervene

--- Chunk ---
But intervention should not involve the government offering educational plans but rather in insuring these plans. Just as the Philippine Deposit Insurance Corp. (PDIC) insures the bank deposits of Filipinos, so will the PhilEd insure their educational plans. Just like PDIC which is funded from the premiums paid by the banks, PhilEd will fund this program from the premiums by the educational plan companies. PhilEd will be ideally suited to do this as it could swap the failed educational plans with school vouchers from its repository of school vouchers

The third dream is based on the realization of Filipino school graduates that their learning must continue even as they leave their alma maters. For in this modern age, the fount of personal knowledge must continuously be replenished. In healthcare, we have the Health Maintenance Organizations (HMOs) which continuously monitor and minister to our health. We need Lifelong Learning Organizations (LLOs) to continuously monitor and minister to our learning. HMOs exist in the Philippines. LLOs do not. In partnership with the international development agencies and the private sector, PhilEd will create this industry

The international development agencies will provide the technical assistance grants that will create the developmental and regulatory framework for the industry while the private sector will organize the LLOs. PhilEd will be the “bastonero” or project manager, managing the project as well as mobilizing government support and assistance. FAPE or the Fund for Assistance to Private Education was a part of the Special Fund for Education set aside by the American government in 1963 from the surplus funds authorized by the War Damage Act of 1962 and organized under Executive Order 156 issued by President Ferdinand Marcos on Nov

In contrast the trustees managing the fund have expanded their services, basically as service provider to the DepEd. As a consequence, it has been spun off as a separate organization, the Private Education Assistance Committee (PEAC)

Over the years, PEAC has evolved into co-implementing externally funded programs, namely the DepEd’s Education Service Contracting (ESC), Teachers’ Salary Subsidy (TSS), the SHS Voucher Program (SHS VP), the In-Service Training (INSET), and the Bayanihan for Basic Education (BBE) as well as implementing internally funded programs of assistance for private education in the areas of training, school quality assurance, school improvement programs, and grants programs. In sum, the PEAC has been an effective instrument to operationalize “complementarity” between private and public schools as provided in the Philippine Constitution

It has also been an incorruptible partner of the education agencies in efficiently co-implementing national subsidy programs for students and teachers in private schools.

Operationally this would mean folding into PhilEd, the roles and responsibilities of FAPE and PEAC as well as their financial resources. Folding FAPE/PEAC into PhilEd would mean the transfer of the funds of FAPE amounting to P277 million as of May 31, 2022 as well as the assets and liabilities of PEAC amounting to P567 million as of May 31, 2022

Interestingly, PhilHealth, in addition to premiums collected from members as well as subsidies from local governments who have enrolled indigents in the program, receives a share of the “sin taxes” collected from Tobacco and Sugar Sweetened Beverage.

Hipgnosis Songs Fund Chair, Andrew Sutch, to step down; all-important ‘continuation vote’ likely to take place on October 26

Hipgnosis Songs Fund (HSF), the UK-listed music rights fund, looks likely to hold its all-important 2023 ‘continuation vote’ on Thursday, October 26, according to an announcement from the firm today. Why’s that ‘likely’ rather than ‘definitely’? Because there’s still a possibility it might get bumped into November – the reasons for which we’ll get into later in this article

Even so: one wonders if some new changes at HSF, announced today, are related to this ‘continuation vote’ – and whether or not they amount to concessions to help keep HSF investors happy and confident in the firm’s long-term prospects… and voting ‘yes, let’s keep going’.

First, a bit of important context. The fundamental revenue performance of HSF doesn’t seem to be under scrutiny from shareholders: the company posted its best-ever revenues in the 12 months to end of March, while streaming ‘pro-forma’ revenue was up 14. 8% YoY in calendar 2022

Where HSF shareholders – as well as its management – are finding frustration is in the current gulf between the firm’s ‘operative Net Asset Value’ (‘operative NAV’) and its value on the public market (i. e. its share price). For example: On September 14, HSF’s market cap stood at approximately GBP £1. 125 billion, which represented a 40% discount on the firm’s operative NAV of USD $2. 316 billion as of the end of March this year. (Said ‘operative NAV’ was calculated by an independent valuer – Citrin Cooperman – using a discount rate of 8. 5%

This is where the importance of that potential $440 million transaction comes in. As MBW reported earlier this month, Hipgnosis Songs Fund’s shareholders are currently considering a proposal to sell 29 of the company’s catalogs to another Hipgnosis company – the Blackstone-backed Hipgnosis Songs Capital (HSC) – for USD $440 million. That potential transaction is being managed for both HSF and HSC by two separate teams within their mutual investment advisor, Hipgnosis Song Management (HSM), which is run and part-owned by Merck Mercuriadis. When it announced its intention to explore the $440 million catalog sale to HSC two weeks ago, Hipgnosis Songs Fund confirmed that one of its motivating factors was that the transaction could potentially act “as a catalyst for a re-rating of [HSF’s] share price”. Aka: Increasing that share price to bring it up closer to the current operative NAV of the company. HSC’s $440 million offer to acquire the 29 catalogs, HSF confirmed earlier this month, equates to a 26% increase on the amount HSF paid for those catalogs to acquire them in the past

The $440 million price also reflects a +51% premium on the value of the 29 catalogs implied by Hipgnosis Songs Fund’s public market cap for the 30 days ending September 13. What happened today?

Amongst the news confirmed by HSF today (September 28) is that the firm’s Chair of its board since 2018, Andrew Sutch, 73, is stepping down, both as HSF board Chair and as a director of the company

HSF says it’s begun a process to recruit a new Chair; Sutch (pictured inset) will leave his post as and when this person is hired, or in any case before HSF’s AGM next year (in Q4 2024). In addition, Andrew Wilkinson, 72, has informed the HSF board of his intention to retire as a board director, which will reduce the company’s board to five directors. HSF also confirmed a number of other new measures in a ‘circular’ to its shareholders today

These measures included the fact that, if Hipgnosis Songs Fund shareholders vote to remain a publicly-traded fund (via that 2023 ‘continuation vote’) at the firm’s next AGM, then another ‘continuation vote’ will be put in front of HSF shareholders at an Extraordinary General Meeting in January 2026. (The ‘continuation vote’ that will take place in Q4 2023 has been scheduled ever since HSF went public in 2018 – i. e. five years after it floated. The 2026 ‘Continuation Vote’, as newly-agreed, means another one is now being scheduled for around two years’ time

In addition, HSF today confirmed some new amendments to its ‘Investment Advisory Agreement’ (IAA) with HSM. These amendments would give HSM a 12-month notice period as HSF’s investment advisor should the IAA be terminated at any point following the upcoming 2023 ‘continuation vote’. Another clause in the new IAA: If HSF’s share price stands at an average discount to ‘operative NAV’ of 10% or more across the month of January 2025 (with that NAV determined at the time of publication of HSF’s interim report for the period to September 30, 2024), the HSF board says it intends to serve notice to terminate the IAA with HSM. However, HSF’s board has also given itself the freedom to un-terminate the IAA during the entire notice period that would follow (e. g

if HSF’s board serves 12-month notice on HSM at the end of January 2025, it would have until the end of January 2026 to withdraw its termination decision). One factor potentially making the future termination of HSM as HSF’s investment advisor less likely? MBW understands that, in such a scenario, HSM would have a first-refusal option to acquire HSF’s copyright portfolio – and could potentially turn to Blackstone (i. e. the backers of Hipgnosis Songs Capital) to find the money to pull off such an acquisition

Why the $440 million offer is connected to the date of HSF’s ‘continuation vote’

While HSF shareholders are considering the $440 million offer from HSC to buy the 29 catalogs, other non-Hipgnosis companies are also being invited to make bids for the same portfolio. Those bids are enabled by a ‘go-shop’ clause in the HSF/HSC proposal that allows the HSF board to consider these non-Hipgnosis approaches for a limited period (until 11. 59pm on October 23, to be precise). Today (September 28), HSF informed its investors that “credible third parties are already engaged in this go-shop process” following its announcement on September 14. As we’ve previously reported, there are potential obstacles in the way of these third parties’ bids. These include the fact that HSM (on behalf of HSC) has a ‘matching right’, meaning that if HSC decides to match the higher bid of a rival, HSF has to sell the catalogs to it – rather than the rival

--- Chunk ---
In addition, any ‘superior’ offer would have to exceed the aggregate cash net proceeds that would ultimately reach HSF’s coffers should HSC’s $440 million offer be executed. (Read more about this condition through here. )

Still, it’s a theoretical possibility that a non-Hipgnosis company swoops for the 29 catalogs from HSF, and gazumps HSC in the bidding process

--- Chunk ---
If a ‘superior proposal’ (versus the $440 million offer from HSC) is received during the ‘go-shop’ period, said HSF today – whether or not HSC uses its ‘matching right’ to beat it – it may be necessary to adjourn the HSF AGM (and therefore the 2023 ‘continuation vote’) into November. In its note to shareholders today, the HSF board reiterated its belief – and Hipgnosis Song Management’s belief – that HSF owns “a unique portfolio of iconic, culturally significant songs that will deliver strong long-term value as they benefit from the structural tailwinds in the music industry”

Whether you’re looking for a basic rewards credit card or want to take advantage of a low APR for a major purchase or balance transfer, the American Express Cash Magnet® Card could be a worthwhile option for you. With a $0 annual fee, it offers a flat cash back rate on all purchases, and there’s no limit on how much you can earn in rewards. Plus, it offers new cardmembers 15 months at 0% APR on purchases and balance transfers completed within the first 60 days of opening an account, giving you more than a year to make payments without interest. However, the card isn’t particularly useful if you travel often. It charges foreign transaction fees, and it lacks the travel benefits that other cards offer.

Using the Cash Magnet Card to earn rewards is simple: you’ll earn an unlimited 1. 5% cash back on every purchase you make

The only transactions you won’t earn rewards on are the following:

One important thing to note: American Express doesn’t allow cardholders to earn rewards during a billing period if the cardmember hasn’t paid the minimum payment due by the due date. Does American Express Cash Magnet® Card offer a new customer bonus?

--- Chunk ---
Once you’ve reached the spending threshold, American Express will credit the $200 to your account as a statement credit. However, it can take eight to 12 weeks after reaching the spending requirement to receive the credit. The bonus on the American Express Cash Magnet® card is relatively low—it’s possible to find cards without annual fees that offer higher bonus amounts—but the bonus offer gives customers more time to reach the spending threshold. Many cards require cardmembers to reach the spending threshold within three months, so unless you spend a significant amount of money each month with your card, you’re unlikely to reach the spending requirement. With the American Express Cash Magnet® card, you have six months to reach the spending threshold. Even if you only use the card for routine expenses, such as utility bills, streaming services, gas for your car or groceries, you could likely reach the spending requirement within six months and earn the $200 cash back bonus

Around the same time, Governor Bryan, who was sworn in in 2019, told George that Epstein had made a request: He wanted a new waiver to loosen certain restrictions placed on him as a convicted sex-offender, according to court filings.

Epstein wanted a new one, George testified during a deposition earlier this year. Governor Bryan told her that Epstein’s lawyers would be in touch, she said. They happened to work for Kellerhals Ferguson Kroblin, according to the former prosecutor, the same local firm that supported his gubernatorial campaign. Erika Kellerhals, who requested the waiver on Epstein’s behalf, had hosted a $1,000-a-head fundraiser for Bryan along with partner Greg Ferguson in 2018. Ferguson later was appointed to Bryan’s transition committee for economic regulation, according to a local press report

Governor Bryan texted George in May 2019, she testified in a deposition, telling her to make a decision. She denied Epstein’s request. George later testified that she thought Epstein was “flexing his political influence over or with the governor” rather than going through the usual channels. Given Epstein’s apparent influence in Virgin Islands, who would want to rock the boat? George says she was willing to try. Around St. Thomas, she has a reputation as a straightshooter. The former public-corruption attorney stops short of pointing to official wrongdoing

But on this sticky August day, in her gold-buttoned blazer, she makes clear that she, for one, wouldn’t tolerate it. “If I have to lose my job to avoid being part of a conspiracy to cover something up, I would do it,” George says. “My bar license, my integrity were more important to me. I wasn’t going to compromise that. ”

Epstein had quietly set up a trust in the Virgin Islands as a repository of his personal fortune, valued at $577 million at the time of his death. George decided to go after the estate and those who might have helped Epstein. “He is dead,” she thought to herself, “but his accomplices must be alive. ”

The law firm representing the estate: Kellerhals Ferguson Kroblin, the same one Epstein had used for years here, and the same one with connections to Governor Bryan

In court filings, the firm quickly blasted the Virgin Islands for sitting on its hands while Epstein was alive. Kellerhals did not respond to a request for comment. The governor gave his blessing when George indicated she wanted to launch a civil enforcement action against the estate. But the tone shifted when the litigation dragged on into a second year. Privately, Bryan expressed frustration. He wanted to know why it was taking so long to settle with Epstein’s estate

George claimed the civil racketeering case was complex and warranted a resolution that at least in part met Epstein’s myriad of wrongdoings in the USVI. In the end the estate returned $80 million in tax incentives, agreed to pay half a million to remediate environmental damage to one of Epstein’s islands, committed half the proceeds from the future sale of Little St James and established a victims’ compensation fund. Officially, George, not the governor, was in charge of making the legal calls. But Bryan was still her boss and held the purse strings. It was a delicate balance, George said

Trying to untangle a half-billion-dollar estate is a formidable task under the best of circumstances. It was even harder given the code of silence still surrounding the dead financier. Many of Epstein’s employees had signed nondisclosure agreements. Some alerted the estate’s lawyers the moment investigators reached out. On Little St. Jeff, groundskeepers avoided eye contact when authorities approached. George herself traveled to Little St. Jeff. She still can’t shake eerie absurdity of seeing a dentist’s chair inside the luxury island villa. In the end, the Epstein estate settled. The other battles would soon follow

George didn’t get much time to celebrate. Four weeks after that deal was struck – and four days after George filed the suit against JPMorgan – the official news arrived from the Office of the Governor. It was New Year’s Eve.

The housing winter arrives early as existing home sales crash to Great Recession levels and the long-feared ‘deep freeze’ sets in

After a long, hot summer that saw mortgage rates creep ever higher, October has brought an early winter for the housing market. Existing-home sales dropped a stunning 15% in September on a year-over-year basis to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 3. 96 million transactions, according to the National Association of Realtors (NAR). That’s the lowest figure in 13 years, since 2010, when the world economy, and particularly the U. S

Contributing factors to the continuous decline in home transactions include surging mortgage rates (which just hit 8% this week—a record in the 21st century), low inventory levels, and home prices that refuse to stop rising. In other words, there aren’t enough homes to buy, money isn’t cheap anymore, and the ones for sale are too rich for most homebuyers’ blood. Indeed, existing-home sales prices topped $306,000, a 5% increase since the year began, according to the Case-Shiller U. S. National Home Price Index

“As has been the case throughout this year, limited inventory and low housing affordability continue to hamper home sales,” NAR chief economist Lawrence Yun said in a statement. “The Federal Reserve simply cannot keep raising interest rates in light of softening inflation and weakening job gains. ” The Fed has raised rates several times this year, with Chair Jerome Powell arming his “higher for longer” stance. Declining housing inventory levels also contribute to the drop in housing transactions. Housing inventory is down 8. 1% from this time last year, according to NAR

Some real-estate experts and economists argue that housing affordability is even worse now than during 2008, when a damaging downturn in the U. S. housing market set off the dominoes that became the Great Financial Crisis that defined a whole decade economically—and in some ways, our current predicament. In 2010, the last time existing home sales were so low, the global economy was on life support and the Fed slashed interest rates down to zero to revive the flatlining patient—fueling an “everything bubble” that inflated all kinds of assets along the way, not the least, housing

The zero-rate regime persisted until the highest inflation in 40 years surprised many economists and prompted the massive series of rate hikes that have brought us to the once-unthinkable 8% mortgage. Some onlookers saw what was coming, for instance Zillow, which warned in May that housing would enter a “deep freeze” if the debt limit standoff failed to resolve and America defaulted, as that would send mortgage rates up to 8%. Of course, the default was averted, but here we have arrived at 8% mortgage rates anyway. But this isn’t like 2008 or 2010 again

It’s time for a 1980s history lesson. Back to the 1980s future

The housing market today isn’t identical to that of the ‘80s, but it’s pretty close. In a lot of ways, millennials are being forced to follow the housing journey of their boomer parents as they face a frozen, unaffordable market with rising interest rates, as noted recently by both BofA Research economist Jeseo Park and by First American chief economist Mark Fleming. Essentially, millennials are a giant generation all collectively coming of homebuying age nearly simultaneously—just like their boomer parents in the 1980s

They’re the “biggest share of the “homebuying pie,” as Redfin puts it, purchasing about 60% of homes bought with mortgages during the past few years. Plus, the raising of interest rates in an effort to combat inflation is strikingly similar to the ’80s. Back then, Fed Chair Paul Volcker fought inflation through aggressive interest rate hikes, with the average 30-year fixed mortgage peaking at about 18% by late 1981. Sound familiar? Current Fed Chair Jerome Powell has set the tone for the most aggressive global hiking of rates in the modern era

Out of fear of losing their lower interest rates, current homeowners are resistant to putting their homes on the market, ultimately leading to the abysmal inventory levels—leaving fewer and fewer properties exchanging hands. Indeed, more than 90% of existing-home owners are locked into mortgage rates below 6%, Odeta Kushi, deputy chief economist at First American, previously told Fortune. “These homeowners do not have a financial incentive to sell,” Kushi says. “The combination of reduced affordability and an even stronger rate lock-in effect suppresses home sales because you can’t buy what’s not for sale, even if you can afford it. ”

Israel thwarts Hamas on the financial battlefield

Two weeks into the war, the Israel Money Laundering and Terror Financing Prohibition Authority (IMPA) received secret intelligence information from two European countries that warned: "A large, well-known organization is raising funds for Hamas through posts on social networks, and fintech company platforms outside Israel, under the guise of donations to Gaza residents. " The information included the name of the organization, its fundraising methods, and the identity of the entities behind it. Their concern was that, within days, the millions of dollars raised would go directly to the military arm of Hamas

IMPA is charged with rooting out the sources of funding for terrorism, working together with the National Bureau for Counter Terror Financing of Israel (NBCTF) in the Ministry of Defense, which is the coordinating body of all activities to thwart terror financing, the Shin Bet, Military Intelligence Directorate (AMAN), and all other relevant intelligence and security agencies. "The most significant way to finance terrorism is to finance countries, not fundraising campaigns

These have intensified greatly over the last month, but the core of the budget - for Hamas, Hezbollah, the Houthis, and the Palestinian Islamic Jihad is Iran, in particular the Quds Force (the special forces of the IRGC, Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps). Hamas has all kinds of additional sources of self-financing, including businesses, associations, investments, and all kinds of arrangements they’ve tried to set up over the years. They need state funding, and without Iran they have no ability to exist

How much money does Iran transfer to Hamas?

"As far as we know, the budget from Iran to Gaza is in the order of $100 million a year. Gaza could do very nice things with this money, make it even more beautiful than Dubai. But from what we know, most of this budget goes to the military wing of Hamas. "

Qatar also transfers money to Hamas. "Qatar transferred suitcases of cash to Gaza through Israel. Everyone knows this

This money allegedly went to pay salaries and civilian needs (education, health, infrastructure), and therefore Israel transferred it, so it’s incorrect to say that it all went to fund terrorism. "

From money-changers to chocolate

How have these billions reached the Gaza street, and Hamas over the years? There are quite a few methods, including cryptocurrencies and trade. But the main and easiest method for money transfer to Gaza is hawala. Ostrovitch-Levi explains, "Most of the money does not reach Gaza physically through the border crossings, but via hawala, a financial channel that is based on trust and connections, and enables the transfer and exchange of funds between countries, without the cash physically passing through them. It’s a channel for transferring the funds raised in other countries. In Gaza there are all sorts of wealthy individuals who can transfer large amounts in cash to Hamas upon receiving request from entities abroad

--- Chunk ---
"

How does the method work?

"Money changers in places all over the world, let's say Turkey, receive money, and inform the hawaladars (money changers) in Gaza who transfer the money on their behalf. When a customer comes to a hawaladar in Turkey and asks to transfer money to Gaza, he does not physically transfer money, but settles accounts internally with money changers in Gaza, and Judea and Samaria. The funds are de facto not transferred

--- Chunk ---
Occasionally, or when the amount of the debt reaches a predetermined ceiling, a transfer is made between the money changers to reset the outstanding debt. "

Is it possible detect the money pipeline between hawaladars and halt the transfer?

"Transfers are made between two ‘exchangers,’ and don’t include the identity of the beneficiaries, or the persons who gave the money. They don’t know what the transactions were, they only know there are debts to offset. We are in a constant battle against this phenomenon

--- Chunk ---
In recent years, Israeli authorities have designated several currency service providers in Gaza as conduits facilitating the transfer tens of millions of dollars a year to terrorist organizations in Gaza. "

Another way to transfer money is trade. Transferring goods, or inflating their value. For example, only days ago, containers of goods worth hundreds of thousands of shekels were seized at Ashdod Port, which were destined for Hamas merchants in Nablus and other cities, with the proceeds intended to go on to finance Hamas operations

Another example is the 23 tons of chocolate bars that were seized in August 2021 in a joint operation by the NBCTF, AMAN, and the Tax Authority at the Nitzana Border Crossing between Israel and Egypt. It was suspected that the snack bars, destined for Gaza, were purchased with terror financing funds, with the proceeds from their sales earmarked for Hamas. Another affair that was uncovered, combined trade and hawala. Hamas funds originating in Iran, which were transferred in cash to money changers in Turkey for transfer to Gaza

At the same time Hamed al-Khachari, a Gazan money changer who worked for Hamas (who was assassinated by Israel in 2019), located Gazan merchants who imported goods from Turkish companies and owned payment on the goods. They paid cash to Khachari, who transferred the money to Hamas in Gaza. Meanwhile, the money changers in Turkey received funds from Hamas abroad that were used to pay the Turkish companies

Hamas is already preparing for "the day after"

Although it has been almost impossible to transfer money and goods to Gaza since October 7, with hawala shuttered, and no trade, Hamas continues to raise funds. "The situation in Gaza is known, and nothing can be brought in, but fundraising activity continues in Judea and Samaria. It’s also possible to make bank transfers to Judea and Samaria, and the fundraising activity hasn't stopped, because while the fighting is going on, they’re continuing to fill their reserves for ‘the day after’ [the war]. We realize they’re raising funds for their continued operations

--- Chunk ---
Hamas is taking advantage of the current sympathy for the Gazans’ situation, and is using online platforms, both of organizations whose business is crowdfunding, and also through the creation of fictitious projects to raise funds: throw-pillows, jewelry and whatnot, and more. "

All this happens openly, for all to see, in Europe, and other places around the world. "Hamas and Islamic Jihad carry out recruitment operations under the guise of humanitarian aid campaigns, and use Telegram, Twitter, Facebook, Instagram and TikTok to disseminate their announcements

The facade is always supporting humanitarian goals, but in practice it's about channels for funding individuals and entities connected directly to Hamas or Islamic Jihad. "

However, IMPA’s goal, Ostrovitch-Levi explains, is not only to stop the individual raising of funds for terror financing, but the entire interrelated chain, from the fund-raiser to the transferrer, and on through to the recipient. "We have the ability to build the intelligence scenario, synchronize all the sources of information received, and delineate the money trail from abroad to Hamas

We’re interested not only in who is running the campaign, the association or entity, but where the money is coming from, and where it’s going. We need to stop all of the elements in this network. "

Ever since October 7, everyone has been discussing and analyzing the question of about the intelligence agencies, and why there was no warning. Where was IMPA before?

"Hamas collects lots of money all the time, and the security agencies deter money transfers

--- Chunk ---
There was no sudden increase in the raising of billions, and you must also remember that most of the money is raised globally, not in Israel. The hundreds of millions of dollars that Hamas receives have been accumulating for years. We had no possibility of seeing a spike in fundraising towards October 7. "

"We understand the west is next"

IMPA is not alone in the fight against terror financing. Three days after the start of the war, Andrea Gacki, Director of the US Treasury Department's Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) contacted Ostrovitch-Levi to request a meeting

The two met at virtually the same time President Joe Biden met with the families of the hostages.

They’ve given us valuable information that we’ve passed on to the security agencies, about organizations they didn’t necessarily know about, and people backing them, all in real time. At the same time, they’ve issued alerts to increase vigilance among the US public about terror financing. "

On October 18, the US Treasury Department's Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) announced that it had imposed sanctions on 10 key Hamas operatives and financial facilitators in Gaza and elsewhere including Sudan, Turkey, Algeria, and Qatar. The statement read, "This action targets members managing assets in a secret Hamas investment portfolio, a Qatar-based financial facilitator with close ties to the Iranian regime, a key Hamas commander, and a Gaza-based virtual currency exchange and its operator… To date, the Treasury has targeted nearly 1,000 individuals and entities connected to terrorism and terrorist financing by the Iranian regime and its proxies, including Hamas, Hezbollah, and other Iran-aligned terrorist groups in the region.

In general, following an appeal by IMPA to its counterparts around the world, there has been a dramatic increase in intelligence coming to Israel from abroad. "The amount of information doubled in the month of fighting, compared with the monthly average. Before the war, we received about 24 intelligence reports a month from parallel authorities, compared with 50 today. "

Countries around the world cooperating with Israel to fight terrorism sounds almost ideal, but it’s hard not to wonder where they were before. "Many countries felt this had nothing to do with them, that it wasn’t their struggle

The international and US mobilization, the task force we founded, the fact that the financial sector abroad suddenly wants to accept the Israeli announcements about the terror entities and people involved, receive intelligence from Israel, and cooperate with us is all only because of October 7.

IMPA is trying to convey these messages to the member nations of the Financial Action Task Force (FATF), an international body to combat money laundering and terror financing. "We are working very hard on isolating Iran in matters of terror financing. But it’s still a cash economy and it is very, very difficult to stop the financing of Hamas, Hezbollah, and Islamic Jihad. Most of the money comes from oil, but there’s actually an Iranian security system budget dedicated to this. "

"Because it involves cash in such huge amounts, a situation has arisen in which the populations in Gaza and Lebanon become addicted to financing from Iran. There is internal collapse and a complete disruption of the ability to receive funds another way. This makes terrorism a very profitable business. It destroys the civic structure, unemployment rates rise very high, and being a Hamas operator becomes profitable. It's a vicious circle that feeds on itself. This is an alternative banking system disconnected from the general system. The Iranians are building whole mechanisms to enable intake of this money

This is something bigger than deterring one transfer or another. "

Can the current global mobilization alter the fight against terror financing?

"Discussions with countries around the world and immediate deterrence are not long-term solutions. Stopping the funds from Iran should be carried out at the international level through FATF, through OFAC sanctions, through sanctions from the entire world. In the end, the solution to Iranian financing are global sanctions. It’s not something that one country can prevent

The bottom line is that without money there is no terrorism, and no matter how hard they try to decapitate the terrorist organizations, as long as they have economic oxygen, as long as the countries of the world do not fight terror financing properly, these organizations will continue to breathe.

Economists, central bankers are rethinking the quantitative easing strategy that saved the world but created bubbles and distortions

After the most aggressive monetary-tightening campaign in four decades, academics and economic practitioners are running autopsies on what could have prevented the cost-of-living crisis and how to ensure the same mistakes won’t be repeated. Markets have scrambled to price in high-for-longer interest rates, with a new war in the Middle East adding yet more risk to an already uncertain outlook confronting central bankers as they gather for their penultimate meetings of a tumultuous year. The policy navel-gazing is centering around three debates

How much flexibility central banks can allow in reaching their inflation targets, the effectiveness of asset purchases in the policy mix, and the merits of monetary and fiscal coordination. Bloomberg surveyed economists from around the world to gather views on those three debates. Their verdict: Central banks won’t break their economies in a rush to hit inflation targets, QE will be used more sparingly in the future, and fiscal policy risks countering the work of monetary authorities

What Bloomberg Economics Says… “A long period of galloping price gains, and fears that the last yards back to target could be most painful for workers, have reignited the debate about whether central banks should aim for a higher rate of inflation.

Rethinking Targets

So long as people believe prices will get back toward 2%, central bankers have some leeway in deciding how aggressive they need to be in pursuing that goal. Economists covering 16 of the world’s most important central banks say policymakers will allow more time to bring inflation back to target if it means less damage to their economies. The Bloomberg special survey also shows that a sizable minority sees them going even further, accepting price pressures that are either slightly too strong or too weak — as long as expectations remain anchored

Olivier Blanchard, a former IMF chief economist, has long argued in favor of raising the inflation target, and former European Central Bank Vice President Vitor Constancio has also embraced the idea. But it’s a controversial view and only possible from a position of credibility, which means central banks would likely have to get inflation back to 2% first. “It would be a mistake of the first order to think you can change a goal you have set if you can’t achieve it,” according to Bundesbank President Joachim Nagel

Global trends suggest inflation will be stronger than in the past, with former Bank of England Governor Mark Carney among those saying rates won’t return to pre-pandemic lows. One lesson Gita Gopinath, the IMF’s No. 2 official, draws from the latest inflation episode is that policymakers mustn’t assume that looking through supply shocks — as text books suggest — is the optimal response. She recommends they be ready to react preemptively, even when inflation hasn’t yet spun out of control

They may be called into action soon on that front, should an escalation in the conflict in the Middle East hit oil deliveries. When the next big global slowdown comes, though, flexibility may be needed the other way. Europe’s eight-year experiment with negative rates ended with mixed reviews last summer as to whether it was all worth it. The Bank for International Settlements argues that there’s room for greater tolerance for moderate shortfalls even if they’re persistent, because “low-inflation regimes, in contrast to high-inflation ones, have self-stabilizing properties

Rethinking Quantitative Easing

With a more flexible approach to those 2% targets, monetary policy after the 2008 financial crisis would have looked very different in many parts of the world. Trillions of dollars, euros, yen and pounds of asset purchases did little to raise prices in the face of global disinflationary forces until governments used the money they raised to stuff cash into consumers’ pockets during Covid lockdowns. But that’s also been blamed for distorting financial markets

Episodes such as the Silicon Valley Bank blow-up are seen by some as a direct result of central bank reserves creation under QE, along with regulatory and supervision failures. Only 40% of economists surveyed predict central banks will use QE the same way as they did before. A quarter expect them to deploy it more sparingly, about 30% see its only role going forward as a tool to address financial-stability concerns and a small minority doesn’t see it being used again at all.

QE effectively swaps long-term borrowing costs for short-term ones. What’s been a lucrative deal for taxpayers when official interest rates were low has now turned into a disastrous trade. The clearest depiction of the problem is in the UK, where the BOE secured taxpayer indemnity for any losses on QE. Over the next decade, it estimates, its purchases will cost the government over £200 billion ($243 billion). And policymakers have little experience in unwinding their balance sheets, where small mistakes can trigger big market turbulence

The Fed experienced some of that when it tried to shrink bond holdings between 2017 and 2019. More recent efforts to reduce portfolios have progressed rather smoothly, partially because central banks have amassed so much debt over the years that they’re far away from any thresholds that would trigger a squeeze. But the fact that they’re treating quantitative tightening as a technical adjustment rather than a part of their efforts to conquer inflation raises questions about the future use of a tool that’s only trusted to work one way

The ECB faces an extra legal burden on bond holdings that comes with operating in a currency union of 20 countries. Concerns around illegally financing governments and debt mutualization have already landed the central bank in court several times. Mixing Policies

Low interest rates and large-scale QE programs allowed treasuries to borrow on the cheap to finance stimulus campaigns, protecting labor markets, businesses and consumers from collapse. But the spending blowout throughout and since the pandemic — part critical emergency funding, part political need to show an all-hands-on-deck approach in crisis — contributed to the latest outbreak in inflation

While the same kind of pulling in the same direction is needed to restrain demand, many governments are concerned that if they tighten policy too hard, voters will kick them out and replace them with populists or extremists. That’s reviving questions about whether central banks can deliver price stability all on their own. “If we were designing optimal policy arrangements from scratch, monetary and fiscal policy would both have a role in managing the economic cycle and inflation, and that there would be close coordination,” Philip Lowe said in his last speech as Australian central bank governor in September

The airline parts scandal sparking panic and introspection in aerospace

His company is accused of falsifying the records that come with aviation components to show they are the real deal. CFM, a joint venture between GE and Safran that manufactures engines, is now pursuing a legal case against AOG in Britain’s High Court. Zamora is defending the case. Verification documents are important because of the exacting specifications of airline parts.

A keen techno DJ, he was also gigging as recently as 2018 according to the Daily Mail. Zamora founded AOG in 2015 from a rented terraced house in Hove, about 70 kilometres south of London on the UK’s South Coast. It appeared to be small scale in its early years: the company’s registered address moved between four homes in the following three years, shifting from Hove to London in 2017. Then, the company was registered at serviced offices in central London. Friends say they haven’t been in contact with Zamora in a number of months as he begins his defence in London’s High Court.

Donald Trump defrauded banks with 'fantasy' to build his real estate empire, judge rules in a major repudiation against the former president

A judge ruled Tuesday that Donald Trump committed fraud for years while building the real estate empire that catapulted him to fame and the White House.

The $777 million surprise: Donald Trump is getting richer

Thousands of pages of exhibits detailing the performance of his assets made available during the trial have provided a deeper look into his fortune. The former president’s 2021 statement of financial condition, filed as part of the lawsuit, pegged his net worth at $US4. 5 billion. Bloomberg’s calculation has consistently been below Trump’s figures. At the same time, Bloomberg measured the value of some Trump properties higher than what New York state claims. Trump took the stand and testified that the properties whose values he’s accused of inflating were actually undervalued, based on the premium his “brand” adds. He also said that banks didn’t rely on his statements of financial condition when weighing loans. “They just weren’t a very important element in banks’ decision-making process,” Trump told the court. “And we’ll explain that as this trial goes along. ” Here’s a look at New York state’s valuation of four high-profile Trump properties where the prosecution alleges fraud occurred, along with Bloomberg’s own approach to assessing the assets.

Trump’s legal team engaged an expert witness who argued that a future buyer could do the same thing. And if they didn’t like the idea of sharing their property with others, they could reduce the club to a membership of one. Still, it’s unclear if Palm Beach would allow that without a change to its zoning status

In 2010, 12 rent-stabilised apartments owned by Trump were valued at an average of $US62,500 each in an appraisal provided by a real estate company. The following year, Trump valued them at $US4. 1 million each — more than 65 times greater. Trump has continued to value stabilised apartments in the building at market rates, including in his 2021 statement of financial condition. Rent-stabilised units “with a positive cash flow are often valued at 15-25 cents a dollar of the open market value, versus single digits for negative cash flow,” said Jonathan Miller, president of appraiser Miller Samuel. Still, Trump’s optimism was shown to be at least partially justified. By 2021, only five of the 12 apartments remained rent stabilised. The prosecution also claims two additional non-stabilised apartments in the building were overvalued because Trump ignored an option his daughter, Ivanka Trump, had to buy them at a price lower than the market value he used. 40 Wall Street Trump’s valuation (2021): $US664 million, Bloomberg valuation (2023): $US270 million, New York’s valuation: No current estimate available In valuing his flagship lower Manhattan office tower, Trump consistently ignored more conservative appraisals he’d received from professionals, New York State argues

The Indian economy posted an impressive 7. 2 per cent growth in the financial year ended March 2023 and 7. 8 per cent in first quarter of current fiscal year. Credit growth also continued to rise, signalling robust demand conditions in the Indian economy, as well as banks' improved appetite towards retail borrowers

These movements have had a cascading effect on global economies, which have seen routs in their respective bond markets, besides a fresh round of currency depreciation. Emerging market economies with large volumes of USD denominated debt are especially vulnerable as they could be caught in a vicious circle of their external debt (in local currency terms) ballooning due to strong DXY and their servicing ability being impaired by tepid economic activity owing to high rates. Even advanced economies have felt the heat, and the ECB etc. have maintained a hawkish narrative, Jain said

Another developing story seems to be the greenshoots of recovery in China backed by domestic consumption in the Golden week, and tourism related to the Asian Games. For now, these seem to buttressed on stimulus and base effects as China is now fully open. The long-term trajectory remains to be seen. In any case, for now this has provided a floor for commodity prices, especially base metals. Fickle commodity prices will also be victims of fresh geopolitical tensions in West Asia, which has pushed up Brent crude

On Sept. 13, Flexport founder Ryan Petersen took the stage at North America's premier supply chain conference in Phoenix. It was exactly a week after he'd forced out his hand-picked successor as CEO, ex-Amazon executive Dave Clark, so Petersen could once again run the show. Sitting in the first few rows of attendees was Clark, the man he'd ousted just a year into the job

Petersen was surprised that he showed up, according to people with knowledge of the matter. Days earlier, Petersen had excoriated Clark, alleging he'd secretly expanded the company's headcount and taken on unnecessary leases without Petersen or the board's knowledge. On X, formerly known as Twitter, Petersen wrote, "Strategic Plan, Day 1: Make better decisions!" With Clark sitting a few feet away, Petersen struck a different tone. "I think we're going to look back and go, 'Wow I'd probably do that all over again because of the progress that we've made,'" Petersen said, in an interview on stage

Doing it over again would seem to suggest hiring Clark wasn't a bad decision. Petersen went even further, personally commending Clark for orchestrating the $1. 3 billion purchase of Deliverr from Shopify , picking up supply chain technology for last-mile deliveries. That deal was announced in May. "I'm very, very lucky because I wouldn't have had the courage to go and do that acquisition, but I give all the credit in the world to Dave Clark," Petersen said. "There's no one probably in the world who would be better at running that last-mile e-com fulfillment network

Personally, I don't have any experience and I would've been pretty intimidated to try and go pull that off. " The mixed messaging from the 43-year-old Flexport founder underscores the dysfunction surrounding the sudden firing of Clark, who previously spent 23 years at Amazon and built its mammoth logistics network on the way to becoming one of Jeff Bezos' top deputies. It's also indicative of a bigger challenge facing Flexport, whose software is designed to simplify the process of transporting goods

Their perspectives have been corroborated by internal documents and communications reviewed by CNBC. Petersen has publicly said Clark overspent, overhired and overpromised, something his allies echoed to CNBC. He burned through cash and kept Petersen in the dark about key financials and an ambitious expansion into providing end-to-end supply chain tools for small and medium-sized businesses. People close to Petersen pointed to a number of previously unreported incidents that eroded his confidence in Clark. But documents viewed by CNBC and sources close to Clark undermine those claims

They show that Clark, who arrived when the company was struggling to bill customers and track containers, worked closely with the board and Petersen to implement decisions that Flexport now suggests were ill-advised. Evidence to support Flexport's claims of financial mismanagement is lacking, raising questions about whether that narrative was put forward to justify Clark's exit. A Flexport spokesperson rejected that characterization. "Ryan Petersen returned as CEO in order to restore Flexport's culture of customer engagement, and drive the growth and cost discipline required to return the company to profitability," the spokesperson said in a statement

Since 2021, Petersen had been seeking a successor for Flexport's then-operating chief, Sanne Manders, in part to address what several ex-employees described as lingering issues with the company's troubled billing processes. Fixing that was Clark's job. Petersen and Clark worked together as co-CEOs for the first six months. In March, Petersen transitioned to executive chairman. The co-CEO arrangement would free Petersen up to do what he loved – "getting beers with customers," in the words of two former Flexport employees. Clark, a self-described "builder at heart," was at the wheel

Among Clark's goals was to help Petersen prepare Flexport for an IPO, something the company had discussed doing within a two- to three-year window, according to a person familiar with the matter and documents viewed by CNBC. "There's a perfect complement of skill sets," Petersen told Forbes in June 2022. "Mine are much more creative, zero-to-one founder time, and Dave is the supreme executor and a legend in the supply chain world.

Shopify had acquired Deliverr in May 2022 for $2. 1 billion. But the e-commerce software company was getting hammered by Wall Street as its Covid pandemic pop faded. By January 2023, CEO Tobias Lutke knew he needed to get rid of Deliverr. Around that time, Lutke first approached Petersen to float the possibility of a deal, according to a person familiar with the matter. Petersen told Clark he should engage with Shopify's team, according to a person with direct knowledge of the negotiations

Initial talks fell apart, but resumed when Flexport executives learned that Shopify was about to execute deep cost cuts and was eager to sell Deliverr. Clark and Petersen flew to Miami to meet with Shopify's leadership. As a transaction was nearing, Clark, who had a reputation as a deft negotiator, got Shopify, which was already an investor in Flexport, to sweeten it with $40 million in cash and the framework for a $260 million convertible note that could help Flexport on its path to an IPO, according to an internal document analyzing the deal. The sale would be announced alongside Shopify's first-quarter earnings report on May 4. "We did not change the terms of a deal or rush it just to have it line up with an earnings call," Shopify said in a statement. With Flexport, "we are tightly mission-aligned to ensure the success of our merchants, which is why we chose to deepen our partnership with them earlier this year.

An attendee asked Petersen whether Flexport would ever get into last-mile logistics.

For much of the summer, Clark had pushed then-CFO Kenny Wagers and his financial planning and analysis team to realign Flexport's year-end and 18-month forecasts, according to a person close to the situation. The reasons were obvious. At the beginning of 2022, it cost around $14,500 to move a single container across the Pacific

By late 2022, prices of ocean freight from Asia to the U. S. West Coast were down 90% from a year earlier, due largely to weakening global demand. Because Flexport makes money by charging fees for the transportation of goods, the company's business was getting hammered. But Wagers and Stuart Leung, a Flexport finance executive and a close Petersen ally, were reluctant to pare back forecasts, frustrating Clark, who felt those projections were overly optimistic. Wagers and Leung did not respond to CNBC's interview requests. Clark ultimately prevailed, but the revised forecasts distressed Petersen

Instead, Ferro told Clark that Flexport's board met the day after Clark resigned and voted to fire him for cause, the person familiar said. Ferro said the board minutes didn't yet reflect why Clark had been fired, the person said. Ferro allegedly told Clark that Flexport would be willing to give him a block of 2 million shares — worth millions of dollars — if he signed a separation agreement that included nondisclosure and nondisparagement clauses

The project was spearheaded by Parisa Sadrzadeh, an executive vice president at Flexport who Clark had poached from Amazon's logistics unit. Earlier in the day, and just up the street from Flexport's event, Amazon had unveiled a strikingly similar service in front of approximately 2,200 attendees at its annual Accelerate seller conference

Flexport had planned to have a booth onsite but was told it couldn't be an exhibitor, which some staffers suspected was due to the competing supply chain products, according to a person familiar with the matter. Flexport discussed securing exhibit space at Accelerate months earlier but didn't meet all the requirements to participate, and its launch wasn't mentioned in those conversations, Amazon said.

NTPC: Why investors can accumulate this stock

The Power Ministry has scheduled tenders of around 50 GW annually of renewable energy for the next five years, to achieve the target of 500 GW of non-fossil fuel capacity. Alongside the government’s thrust on ramping up renewable energy capacity, building incremental thermal capacity has also been a priority. This is because energy security has become an important issue with consistent increase in demand in recent years; power demand is now at all-time high/peak levels. PSU thermal major NTPC appears to be well-placed to capture both themes — energy transition and energy security

Since our accumulate rating on NTPC in bl. portfolio dated August 13, 2023, the stock has gained around 48 per cent. This has been majorly on account of growth in earnings as well as re-rating in the stock from the trailing P/E of around 10 times then, to 12 times now. During FY23, the company’s revenue increased by around 32 per cent. While there was flattish growth in PAT during the period on account of increase in fuel cost, the same grew nearly 30 per cent YoY in H1FY24

NTPC is now trading at a one-year forward P/E of around 11 times, which is around 35 per cent higher than its historical five-year average P/E of around 8. 2 times. The re-rating in the stock has happened mainly due to company-specific and industry-level structural positives (which justify current premium to historical average) and the company’s aggressive capacity addition plans. We maintain our postive stance on NTPC and investors can continue to accumulate the stock on account of growth plans in place, along with the strong revenue and earnings visibility due to assured return model

Further, it is offering a decent dividend yield of around 3 per cent. Business

NTPC earns majority of revenue from sale of power generated from thermal-based generating stations. More than 90 per cent of its revenue is tied to long-term power purchase agreement (PPA) under cost-plus based tariff regime, which ensures pass-through of costs such as plant capacity charge, supplementary capacity charge (emission control system cost), interest on loan, interest on working capital and energy cost (fuel) and allows ROE (Return on equity) of 15. 5 per cent over and above these costs

The complete recovery of capacity charges is allowed when the plant shows technical availability (plant availability factor) over and above the normative level i. e. typically 85 per cent wherein the plant should be technically available to generate power with sufficient coal in place. However, do note that pass-through is allowed subject to normative parameters and provisions defined in the PPA. NTPC has assured coal supply, given its long-term fuel supply agreements (FSAs) with Coal India Limited (CIL) and Singareni Collieries Company Limited (SCCL) for supply of coal for 20 years for total Annual Contracted Quantity (ACQ) of 183 MTPA

Further, the company has captive coal mining with capacity of 71 MMT. Recent performance

During H1FY24, the company reported PAF (plant availability factor) in its coal-based generation stations to the tune of 93. 32 per cent as against 92. 05 per cent in H1FY23. Further, PLF (Plant Load Factor) i. e. capacity utilisation for the period has been 76. 62 per cent against 77. 27 per cent in the last year and national average of 68. 75 per cent. The company reported a YoY increase in generation of around 4 per cent, reaching 212 billion units (BUs) in H1FY24

Coal supply during H1FY24 was 113 MMT, including 4 MMT of imported coal. The coal consumption during the corresponding previous period was 112 MMT, including 10 MMT of imported coal. The company has reported flattish revenue growth in H1FY24 reaching close to ₹88,058. 44 crore. This has been on account of shutdown in certain plants due to repair work and grid restrictions, which is expected to improve, going forward, in the upcoming quarters, as per the management

The company saw a YoY growth of around 18 per cent in EBITDA reaching ₹25,091 crore and thereby EBITDA margins expanded from 25 per cent to 29 per cent on a YoY basis. This has been mainly on account of lower fuel cost due to reduced share of imported coal. The imported coal price rose steeply in FY23, the pass-through of which might not have been allowed completely, which resulted in decline in margins in FY23

Growth triggers in place

NTPC plans to have 130 GW of installed power generation capacity comprising 60 GW of renewable energy from the current level of 3. 3 GW. While this is quite a long-term target, in the near term, NTPC plans to add 15-16 GW of renewable energy by FY26. Currently, around 7. 7 GW of RE capacity is under construction and 11 GW under different stages. Further, as all-time high peak power demand makes the case for having thermal-based capacity as an energy security, NTPC plans to add 10-11 GW of thermal-based capacity by FY26

The target for the same has been raised from 7 GW earlier. This will imply capacity growth during FY23-26 to the tune of 10-11 per cent CAGR from the current levels.

For FY25 and FY26 it will be on similar lines while capex will shoot up on account on growth in renewable-related capex post then as per the management

During our previous call, we highlighted that NTPC was attempting to monetise its stake in its renewable energy arm NTPC Green Energy Ltd (NGEL) by way of selling stake to a strategic partner. However, during Q1FY24 earnings call, management highlighted that the company is now looking to unlock value by way of IPO rather than onboarding strategic investor. However, the timeline is not yet certain as it will depend on market-based factors and within how much time substantial RE capacity is there on the ground. The company has a D/E of around 1
