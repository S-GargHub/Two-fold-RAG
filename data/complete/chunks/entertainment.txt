Picking the best class in Baldur’s Gate 3 is one of the most important decisions you’ll make in the game. There are 12 classes and 46 subclasses across them all. The classes are all fairly well-balanced, and the game gives you many opportunities for creative problem solving. Baldur's Gate 3 gives you the option to play as an Origin character. You can just choose one of the NPCs from your party and play as them right out of the gate. It’s a perfectly fine way to play if you really want to

Baldur’s Gate 3 (or D&D) has a lot of overlap in the classes. No easy way to say one class is best (or even better) Instead, focus on what you want to do (or how to do it), and go from there. Fighters start out as a very straightforward melee class. With high strength, they get all armors and shields, and choose a method of combat to focus on (and get buffs to) They also get a way to heal themselves and way to get a second attack once per short rest

Paladins start out mixing in (Divine) magic with their melee abilities. Monks are a melee class kind of like Fighters, but with a lot more pizzazz. Their best Ability is Dexterity, so their combat is more martial arts than swordplay. Monks don't get armor and only have a limited set of weapons available. Way of the Open Palm is the best subclass for a Monk. And Way of Shadow makes your Monk sneaky and stealthy. Consult our Monk build guide for more details on why, and to see which skills and feats to pick. Best magic class for beginners: Warlock

If you choose The Archfey as your subclass, your patron is a lord or lady of the fey, a creature from before the time of mortal races. Those serving The Great Old One are bound to a mysterious being from the Far Realm. The Archfey also has two exclusive spells — Faerie Fire and Sleep. For Warlocks, it’s best to focus on weapon and armor proficiencies. Githyanki Martial Prodigy means you get medium armor along with longswords and greatswords. Charisma (for spellcasting) is your most important stat. Constitution is also a good option for the hit points

Make Charisma your highest stat and Constitution your second highest.

Jada Pinkett Smith and Will Smith have been separated since 2016. The couple have previously doubled down on their stance against getting a divorce. But her recent reveal about their lengthy separation poses a new ques. When should couples just get divorced? Jada shared that during the 2022 Academy Awards - when Will slapped Chris Rock after he cracked a joke about Jada’s appearance - the pair had actually been separated for six years. “We’ve been doing some really heavy-duty work together,” she explained, while promoting her new memoir, Worthy. Jada Pinkett Smith and Will Smith have been married for 26 years. During an interview with Today, Jada revealed she had a relationship with singer August Alsina. The A-listers have made it clear that divorce was never in the cards. Will and Jada's dynamic includes living in separate homes, but it could be a choice that’s for the better. Relationship expert Susan Winter highlighted the jarring differences between a separation and divorce. Separations can also be beneficial if both individuals are working on themselv.

If a lack of connection occurred before couples separated, that separation doesn't necessarily make the issues go away. Lucas believes that in these situations, couples could be avoiding the inevitable breakup for the sake of comfortability. It's unclear whether Jada and Will plan on ending their separation and living in the same home again. However, the couple have been candid about their plans to not get a divorce. Jada previously recalled that when she first decided to get married to Will in 1997, it would be for the long haul

Will Smith and Jada Pinkett Smith made a promise not to get a divorce. Dating coach Lucas says it's important for both parties to be invested in their relationships. He believes a divorce shouldn't feel like a taboo because people grow apart and that's fine. Jada and Will have agreed not to sign a prenuptial agreement. They made the promise to each other while sitting on a log in his mother's backyard. Jada says they still feel trapped with someone they don’t want to be with. In 2020, Jada made headlines when she revealed in a Red Table Talk episode with her husband that she had a relationship with Alsina. She explained that she and her husband were “separated amicably” when the romance occurred, which had not been disclosed to the press at the time. Will Smith and Jada Pinkett Smith have been separated for a year. The couple has been involved in controversy in the past, including a fight at the 2014 Academy Awards.

Winter believes Will has a tremendous love and commitment to Jada. The public will never fully know what “heavy-duty work” Will and Jada are doing in their relationship. Still, she believes that their choice to separate is something fluid and outside of the traditional marriage design. Will and Jada have been spending seven years apart as a married couple. Why would they decide to go back to living in the same household? “They’re in the rough with a machete, carving a new path for themselves,” Winter said. The couple's relationship could end in a variety of ways

Even once Britney is the biggest pop star in the world, her parents still seem to have an undue say in the running of her career, including making her sit for humiliating TV interviews. Her father seizes control legally with the imposition of the conservatorship, telling her, chillingly, “I am Britney Spears now,” and her family appear to live off her dime. Britney writes that she is working to feel “more compassion than anger” towards them. “It’s not easy. ” She resolves to start over with a new notebook

It’s one of a kind, but also in conversation with many other films about love and art

Zhang Yimou is perhaps best known for his work in the wuxia genre, like Hero, House of Flying Daggers, and Shadow. His latest, the political comedy Full River Red, is a fun and strange twist-y thriller that trades some of his usual love for soaring action for fast-paced dialogue.

She says there isn’t a right or wrong time to introduce your partner to your family. But the intentions of such an introduction must be clear. Communication before the holidays goes both ways. There are things that your family should know about your significant other too. If there's something about your partner that could be surprising to your family, or that’s a notable difference from who you’ve brought home before, tell your relatives that. It's important to have conversations with your partner before you go away. It's also important to make sure you're not staying in the same room as each other. If you're staying in a hotel, make sure it's not too far from your home. During the holiday season, your partner may be seeing how you interact with your family for the first time. That’s not necessarily a bad thing, according to the relationship experts. any family drama that may arise isn’t hurting your relationship.

Eileen takes a compact and uncomfortably close eye to a psychological thriller about ladies making bad decisions. Howerton rewires his Always Sunny Dennis persona into a true warhead, barking at Doom-playing brainiacs until they get results. Baruchel’s arc as a tech genius sinking in corporate quicksand is almost a mini Breaking Bad. Eileen is a perfect anti-holiday film in the vein of David Fincher’s The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo. The close-up is director Savanah Leaf's flex. On each character, she moves in close, like a friend at a party with a secret to tell

Wes Anderson has made bare the artifice essential to filmmaking. Actors recite Dahl’s words verbatim, often speaking directly to the camera. The sets are treated like those on a theater stage, collapsing or building in real time. M3GAN is a refreshingly goofy spin on that old trope — and a fairly creepy one, too. Scripted by Akela Cooper with the same shamelessly messy, giddy verve she brought to Malignant. packed with referential humor, but still channeling some real anxiety about the place computers have in our lives

This is not a horror movie whose horrors rely on brutality and gore — though there is certainly that and then some — but one whose apocalyptic premise provokes both outright terror and disquieting introspective dread. At its center, controversially edging Cruise’s slinky pas-de-deux with Rebecca Ferguson out of the frame, is a new, more kinetic and balletic partnership between the star and Hayley Atwell. The pair somehow blend jaw-dropping practical stunt work with ballroom dancing, silent slapstick, and rom-com meet-cute — a perfect, fizzing cocktail of a century of cinematic sugar highs

David Fincher is famous for his precision on set and his dedication for finely honing every aspect of his films until they’re exactly what he needs.

The Enzo Ferrari biopic’s standout sequences are unquestionably its races, which director Michael Mann infuses with tension, speed, and horror.

It is equally about Suzume, the protagonist, overcoming her own trauma. The romance is subtle, the barest hint of it actually, and that just makes it resonate even more.

The film is set in Savannah, Georgia, and follows Portman's character as she prepares for a role. Todd Haynes’ film certainly has callbacks to other, classic movies about selfhood.

Wes Anderson is always game to top himself, finding new ways to add layers to every part of his work.

Mattel has been criticised for its new Barbie doll honouring Wilma Mankiller, the first female Principal Chief of the Cherokee Nation. The creation of the doll is part of the toy company’s ‘Inspiring Women’ ser. Wilma Mankiller was the nation’s first female Principal Chief, leading the tribe for a decade until 1995. She focused on improving social conditions through consensus and on restoring pride in Native heritage. The social worker, who died in 2010, met snide remarks about her surname with humour. The wrong sets of symbols used for the Cherokee language were included in the packaging of the doll

As a result, the symbols on the package read “Chicken Nation” as opposed to Cherokee Nation’s ‘Cherokee’ The Cherokee Nation issued a statement regarding the criticism. “Regrettably, the Mattel company did not work directly with the tribal government’s design and communications team to secure the official Seal or verify it,” the tribe said.

Fury dump builds use the Unbridled Rage Key Passive. Weapon swapping builds offer what is almost certainly the most unique playstyle for Barbarians. All Barbarian builds will likely use some skills that make them go Berserk, the Unconstrained Key Passive just enhances the effect. When making a build, you want to have one of these Key Passives in mind and choose your skills accordingly. Thankfully skills that share certain aspects (like Bleed) are color-coded on the skill tree. Other Barbarian builds let you take advantage of mechanics like Thorns or Shouts

Hannah Keeley, a Virginia-based parenting expert, offered up some of the biggest mistakes parents tend to make at Christmastime. Keeley identified the top five holiday blunders that parents often make. Doing the most could lead to a season of disappointment, she warned. Parents should "take it easy and leave plenty of room to relax," said Keeley. Using Christmas as a bribe turns the focus of Christmas into "selfish gain on the part of your children," she said. "Beautiful family Christmas memories can be made without the drive-in ‘Grinch’ movie," she added. It's important to keep the holidays well-rounded, Keeley said

"Being a mom is a professional career and deserves to be treated accordingly" "Love your kids enough to learn how to manage their behavior appropriately and teach them self-discipline," she said. Children up to the age of 9 process information egocentrically, Keeley said. Parents should avoid "processing their frustration around the holidays audibly around the children," she said. "The ‘mom brain’ is wired to process problems rapidly and move on to solutions," said Keeley. "Many parents make the mistake of teaching their children that Christmas is a time to make a ‘wish list’ and get what they want," she said

Martin Scorsese has curated a 23-year career within a career. His movies have never been more relevant than they became during the past two decades. With each subsequent release, as his career winds down, critical appreciation for him grows. In the 21st century alone, Scorsese has made nine feature-length narrative films. His stretch from 1976's Taxi Driver through 1990's Goodfellas is still his peak run. Some of those nine movies are long-gestating bucket-list triumphs revisiting the pet subjects that defined his oeuvre

In all Scorsese’s late-period films, he is consciously returning to certain pet subjects and periods in his work — not to repeat himself, but to revise and add greater perspective. The Irishman, about a man aging and dying with his guilt and sins unresolved, is intended as a bookend to his crime trilogy with Robert De Niro and Joe Pesci. Scorsese has returned to his old themes and obsessions, but in the process, they’ve become more contemplative. 2004’s The Aviator is his most conventional movie to date, the most traditional, Old Hollywood film he has made

From the outside, The Departed appears to be a cynical, domestic remake of a Hong Kong cops-and-robbers shootout. But Scorsese makes it his own and breathes bizarre life and energy into it. It contains the continuity errors, quick cutting, both rhythmic and arrhythmic needle bombs. What grounds it is the framing. Scorsese is telling us a familiar story we’ve come to expect from him. The brilliance is the way he mines filmgoers’ long relationship with crime. It’s an absolute miracle Scorses and Schoonmaker manage to produce a masterpiece

Scorsese weaponizes postmodernism, using viewers’ presumed existing familiarity with his films as context. You don’t get the full gale force of this film, its pleasures and its overarching point, without Scorsese reaching back to his past work, and relying on viewers to recognize his voice. Scorsese’s take on the material largely operates outside the text, centering the story on a peripheral character we know little about. Miraculously, the film also has its funny elements, incorporating The Departed and The Wolf of Wall Street's nervy energy. Scorsese is expressing guilt and culpability as a beneficiary of this inequality

In the movie’s closing minutes, he literally puts himself squarely in the frame. In an uncharitable light, it plays as performative, as an older relative getting worked up over a police brutality Facebook post. This century has seen Scorsese zigging and zagging as always, but because he’s following his own varied interests. An artist who spent the first 30 years of his career desperate for autonomy finally got it. Remarkably, getting the control that eluded him when he was younger has made his films more consistently collaborative

Starfield has top-tier world-building, a fantastically customizable ship builder, and Bethesda’s most engaging combat to date. Galaxy-spanning faction quests give you plenty to do, but it's the side quests that make you feel like the captain in something Star Trek adjacent. Nightdive Studios updated the 1994 classic with a slick coat of modern paint. The game's look captures all of the original System Shock’s garish cyberpunk neons and frightening enemies in a style that appears like a modern high-fidelity game at a distance.

In the years before his death in 2014, the actor was unaware he was dealing with Lewy body dementia. The autopsy found no illegal drugs or traces of alcohol in the man's system

The Xbox controller boasts native compatibility on Steam Deck, plus recent versions of Android and iOS. A growing number of mobile games support it, too, and it works like a charm with the Xbox Game Pass game streaming app. It requires two AA batteries, though on a positive note, the battery life is around the 40-hour range. Microsoft’s Xbox Elite Series 2 features swappable stick caps and directional pads, adjustable tension for its analog sticks, and customizable back paddles. If you want more buttons and tweakable settings in a controller, this might be worth its $178. 99 price

This model is compatible with Xbox and PC. The DualSense controller costs $69. 99. It's compatible with Android and iOS, but not with PC games. There are other ways to use the controller, but it's not for everyone. The controller is compatible with Xbox One, PS4, PS3 and Xbox 360. You can add the DualSense to a “non-Steam game” within Steam. To get around using Steam entirely, you can download an app called DS4Windows along with some drivers. The app gives you a host of settings to customize the Dual Sense’s button mapping

The DualSense is the official controller for the PS5. In games that support its features, it can have realistic-feeling haptic feedback and gyroscopic motion controls. It’s a good controller for using PS Remote Play, too. The DualSense Edge is compatible on PC, but Sony and Steam haven’t developed drivers that let gamers take full advantage of its back paddles and swappable control schemes. The PS5’s interface for the Edge is intuitive, and it makes remapping controls and setting schemes the breeze that it should be. The Switch Pro controller is, unsurprisingly, a fan

The controller allows up to three custom control schemes, which you can switch between with its middle “star” button. 8BitDo makes a pricier version of this controller with Nintendo-style face buttons called the Ultimate Bluetooth. The Ultimate Bluetooth is similar in a lot of ways to Nintendo’s Switch Pro controller, with its motion control support, rechargeable battery, and Nintendo-style face button layout. Its biggest benefit is its Gulikit Hall effect analog sticks, which are resistant to developing drift over time by design. By comparison, the potentiometer-based sticks used in the Ultimate 2. 4g bear no such guarantee. CNN

It features five new tracks, expanding on the themes and relationships she explored on the original. Here's a guide to all the songs and what Taylor has said about them

"I could dance to this beat forever more" Swift moved to New York in 2014 and was amazed to discover she could go grocery shopping largely incognito.

"I would never have said anything like that on a previous album," she says. "My previous albums have always been, 'I was right, you were wrong' It gets very complicated, very quickly," she adds.

"It was almost like this very strange, subtle clue to the media that they don't know everything that happened in that relationship," she said. In her Rolling Stone cover story, Taylor said the crash actually occurred on a snowmobile "with an ex who lost control and wrecked it" All You Had To Do Was Stay is about an ex who comes back begging for a second chance.

An early draft of the lyrics had the couple fleeing the city and blotting out the pressures of the world, an idea which eventually resurfaced in I Know Places. Over that backing, Taylor turns agony aunt, dispensing advice on how to win back someone's heart. Taylor was beginning to experiment with different vocal styles on 1989. The multi-tracked, semi-whispered performance on this track foreshadows the delicate sounds of the Folklore and Evermore albums.

I Know Places was fuelled by Taylor's increasing anxiety over holding down relationships in the spotlight. Co-written with indie-pop auteur Imogen Heap, 1989's original album closer is very much the palette cleanser its title suggests. "When I was finally clean, that's when I could finally breathe" is one of Taylor Swift's best-known songs. The song is about a relationship that ends in disaster. "It's all fun and games til someone loses their mind" is another. Lena Dunham's new single is called "Won't You Be My Neighbor" The song is a tribute to her late mother, who died of lung cancer

The song was written in response to the death of her father, who passed away last year. 1989 is an anthem to resilience and power. It was originally held back as a bonus track.

It is the first time the band has released a new song since the release of the first album. Taylor has been brutal about pruning songs from 1989's original tracklist.

Diana feels she “still has a lot to offer the country as a public servant’. Diana and Blair discussed a special role for her as an overseas “ambassador” for Britain. She asked if there was a way to work with the government on “a more formal basis” and that any “official role” would be appreciated. It took a while for Queen Elizabeth and Camilla to grow close. She was reluctant to accept Charles’s request to be more accommodating to Camilla. Unlike in The Crown, she is said to have once referred toCamilla as ‘that wicked woman’ to Charles”

Helen and Sam are involved in different ways with the same double murder. More murder, blackmail, cover-ups, and a great deal of double-dealing follow. Do these two crazy kids have a future together? Does either deserve a fu? Lured (1947) is a strange crime thriller starring Lucille Ball. Sandra Carpenter (Ball) is working as a taxi dancer when a friend of hers disappears

The police ask Sandra to act as bait for the killer, which sends her on a bizarre tour of seedy London. Murder by Contract is a lean, mean noir that had a big influence on Martin Scorsese. It's more in the mode of M than The Naked Gun, with the focus on the noose tightening around the killer. The director has listed it as one of his guilty pleasure movies. Irving Lerner directs the movie masterfully on a minimal budget

Joseph Gordon-Levitt stars as the hard-bitten PI equivalent, a high school kid devoted to a girl who jilted him, then turned up dead. This one’s full of fun surprises, but it also respects the genre and plays fair by noir fans. Bad Times at the El Royale is an underrated blast. Cynthia Erivo in a star-making role, Chris Hemsworth in a part that makes the most of his sex appeal. The movie assembles a motley crew of unrelated guests (or are they?) at a seedy motel

Clocks go backwards one hour at 2am on Sunday 29 October. This will give us an extra hour in bed as we prepare for the colder months when the sun sets earlier and days get significantly shorter. The clocks won’t go forward again until Sunday 31 March 2024. Many academics, scientists and campaigners have called for the abolition of the clock turning-tradition. But what are the advantages of such a decision? We speak to the experts to get the low-down on the issue. Annual energy savings of £400 per year if DST is scrapped

Even a small reduction in sleep has been shown to impact your immune system, however. The move from daylight saving time interferes with your natural circadian rhythm. The 24-hour biological cycle is influenced by morning light and evening darkness. Try to limit yourself to a one-hour window if you need to adjust when you get up and when you go to sleep at night. A Danish study of more than 185,000 people over 15 years found that the transition from summer time to standard time was associated with an 11 per cent rise in depressive episodes

Conversely, the switch from winter to summer time was found to have no effect. The UK first introduced Daylight Saving Time in 1916. It was introduced to encourage people to spend more time outdoors in daylight. Distress associated with the sudden advancement of sunset, marking the coming of a long period of short days, may explain this finding. A 2019 YouGov poll found that the majority of Brits were marginally in favour of keeping DST, however. 44 per cent voted to keep the current system, while 39 per cent said they wanted to ditch it

Shayda’s story may be centred on escaping abuse and fighting for custody of her child, but it's also about friendship, music, dance, laughter and reclaiming freedom. A large part of the film is devoted to the character holding on to the rituals of Persian New Year, and finding a way to connect with her culture amid the upheaval. ‘The world is seeing the strength of Iranian women now; it’s not just me looking at my mum in admiration,’ says Niasari. Shayda says the world is seeing the strength of Iranian women now. She is optimistic that more stories will be told about the diaspora experience.

The "Almost Home" crooner said re-enlisting has been "refreshing" and "very exciting" Craig noted that joining the Army is all about being a part of something that is "so much bigger than yourself" The biggest challenge when Morgan was in active duty was the time commitment. He told Fox News Digital that there were moments when he was away from his family for a year at a time. Although there are challenges when joining the military, to Morgan the reward is worth it. Morgan was sworn in again at age 59 to the U. S. Army Reserve on stage at the Grand Ole Opry. He previously served in the Army and Army Reserve with the 101st and 82nd Airborne Divisions.

With the Steam Deck, I could — for the first time — play the bulk of my sprawling collection of video games wherever I’d like. But I tended to bundle it with a huge portable power supply. I also couldn’t quite shirk how much better games looked on our family's OLED TV. The Steam Deck OLED is identical to the original Steam Deck.

For those who haven't tried a Steam Deck, though, I wouldn't wait for its sequel. The Steam Deck OLED delivers on Valve’s original promise of 30-50% more battery. The panel has a wider color gamut (110% DCI-P3, for the visual obsessives) and the beautiful, inky blacks that OLED dorks like myself adore. The OLED panel also has a 90 Hz refresh rate — perfect for frame doubling from 45 frames per second. The higher the frame rate, the faster the battery drain — assuming you can even spot the difference between 90 Hz and 120 Hz

The former couple continue to have their ups and downs when it comes to co-parenting their two teenage sons, Sean Preston and Jayden. Spears' memoir, The Woman in Me, is due for release on 24 October. Britney Spears and Kevin Federline have been married since 2004. The couple have been open about their struggles with co-parenting.

In February of that year, Spears entered into a conservatorship with her father Jamie Spears, who took complete control over her assets. Federline moved on to his now wife Victoria Prince.

Two villains new to the series take center stage, as well as a returning cast of nearly every villain from the previous two games. Miles and Peter return from their individual outings for a dramatic team-up. The main story sometimes swaps Spider-Mans mid-missi. Kraven and Venom are our principal antagonists. There are others besides them that should delight comic fans

Peter’s plot involves a retelling of the Venom origin story. Side missions often allow either Spider-Man to tackle them, but the main story beats require one or the other. Hailey Cooper, Miles’ love interest from his solo game, takes more of an MJ-esque role. American Sign Language is featured heavily throughout Miles’ missions. Of the two Spider-Mans, it’s Miles who feels more alive with the possibility to break free of expectation and canon. One of the Miles-specific side quests involves learning about the artistic history of Harlem

The film ends with a promise of pushing back against Spider-Man 2099, and with it, the established canon. Miles disagrees, believing it isSpider-Man’s job to resist the seemingly inevitable. I was hungry for Spider- man 2 to push back in a similar way. Each Spider-Man now has a full arsenal of special moves and gadgets that complement one another. The game is beautifully rendered, taking full advantage of the newest PlayStation. Questions about mass incarceration, recidivism, and reintegration into society for formerly incarcerated people are explored

A movie version has been in the works almost since the game launched. Warner Bros. bought the movie rights in 2015, and the project moved over to Blumhouse a couple of years later. Game creator Scott Cawthon wrote and rewrote the script. Five Nights at Freddy's has a brief mid-credits scene. It isn't integral to the movie's lore, and doesn't feel like a sequel tease. It's more of a comic scene involving YouTuber and horror-game aficionado Cory DeVante “CoryxKenshin” Williams. Five Nights at Freddy’s is the latest installment in the popular horror franchise. The movie is aimed at fans of the original, but is also accessible to new audiences. The film's backstory is parceled out awkwardly, in ways that are sometimes confusing. The movie is kind of weird, and not because of some missing fan-only information that unlocks all its inconsistencies. Some of the more complicated lore has been stripped out, though it could probably be reintroduced in any sequel. This does make the movie more accessible for franchise newcomers. The Five Nights at Freddy’s games have a surprising amount of young fans

Unlike A Nightmare on Elm Street or Friday the 13th, the movie is rated PG-13, rather than R. The most ghoulish aspects of the Freddy's backstory are kept off screen or entirely unmentioned. There are plentiful cheap music-sting jump scares and a few gruesome bits of junior-level gore. Violence-wise, this is a harder PG-13 than your average superhero movie. As expected, the interesting element of the movie is Cage’s performance. Willy’s Wonderland is a strange combination of a unique movie-star brand with an off-brand version of the famous game series

A total Five Nights novice might even prefer the sillier, shorter Cage version. It's not quite enough for Willy's Wonderland to reach the upper echelon of Cage's last decade, but hardcore fans of either the actor or the concept might enjoy it

The blue Halloween bucket trend first started in 2018. Louisiana mom Alicia Plumer took to Facebook indicating that her son, who has autism, would be carrying a blue bucket to indicate his disability. "These precious people are not ‘too big’ to trick-or-treat," she wrote. Many Facebook users praised the idea of the blue bucket. The National Autism Association warned that not all parents find the color necessary. Some parents are concerned that the color could make it harder for children with autism to trick-or-treat

"This idea, aside from being horribly ableist, as it's intended to denote the child as ‘different’ (read: autistic) harms children w/dietary needs," one X user posted.

" t can be a teaching tool for others; however, it should never be about others," she says. "It should always be about your child," she adds

Players have been looking for gender in this generation’s iteration of Link since before Breath of the Wild released. The idea of a female Hero of Time simmered. And if the character shown wasn’t Link, then maybe it was a playable Zelda. Sarah Stang contends that Link’s gender expression has never been incorporated into that vision. She argues that the Triforce both represents and enshrines the subordination of women to men in Hyrule

“If we have princess Zelda as the main character who fights,” Aonuma asked, “then what is Link going to do?" Breath of the Wild's gender trouble continued closer to release. Leaked screenshots revealed Link’s encounter with the character Vilia outside of Gerudo Town. A crossdressing Link was genuinely embraced among artists, cosplayers, and authors of fan fiction. Gerudo Town is a gendered and raced space unlike the other settlements on the periphery of Hyrule. Alongside the bird people, fish people, and rock people, the Gerudo are a vaguely Arabic or North African-coded, all female, matriarchal society

Vilia, who can be read as a trans woman, is said to be welcomed in the city. Many more compliment Link’s appearance in strictly feminine terms. The presence of a black-market armor shop further denies any gender essentialist notions like the ones that suggest Vilia is a man dressed as a woman. Vilia is one of a handful of named characters missing from Tears of the Kingdom. The armor she gifted Link, which was once previously for sale in Gerudo Town’s market, is also conspicuously absent

--- Chunk ---
The game does away with almost all of the queer subtext brimming just beneath Breath of the Wild's surface. Tears of the Kingdom does introduce new armor sets that can play with expression, but none are explicitly feminine. Most are Zonai in origin, a fictional ancient culture that borrows heavily from pan-Mesoamerican and Egyptian imagery. The change transforms queer materials into something more like cultural tchotchkes. What pervades the land in place of calamity is not the evil of Ganon, but of gender deviance. In Tears of the Kingdom, characters often make jokes emasculating Link

The Great Fairy Mija, however fond of him, describes Link as “a slim little lad” It turns out queer joy was only accepted in the empty, unstructured wilds of a Hyrule beholden to calamity. But in a world that has been filled by side quests and the new settlements of a monarchy reborn, there is no need for a hero who wears a skirt like a girl. The Triforce rests not in the trinity of the spiritual aspects of Power, Courage, and Wisdom, but instead in the gender binary

After all, the company is known for its next day delivery and easy returns service. ASOS lost £300m in the year to 3 September, compared with £31m the previous year. In July and August, the company was hit by wet during the summer months, forcing the company to cut its losses by 30 per cent. Some experts now say ASOS is in danger of losing its popularity

ASOS’s business model of allowing large numbers of free returns makes the company susceptible to financial losses during challenging economic conditions. Rick Smith, Managing Director of business recovery firm Forbes Burton tells The Independent that ASOS has perhaps reached their ceiling now. Young people are increasingly buying individual items from retailers on Instagram and TikTok. ASOS stocks brands such as Pull and Bear, Stüssy and Bershka, which all have their own websites. “The online fashion landscape is evolving now to a point that customers are looking for a more tailored service from websites,” says Smith

Wish is the culmination of the studio's celebration of its centennial. It's openly a nostalgia-fest, pretty much on par with the other ways the company celebrated its 100-year anniversary. The company has a full century of beloved movies, characters, and storytelling to mine for big emotion. Disney has been selling nostalgia for decades, but it's not sustainable. In order to move forward, the company needs to shed the nostalgia. The live-action remakes might make a lot of money in the short run, but all they're really doing is reit

Disney has been making sequels to its most popular movies for years. The studio's many live-action remakes don't seem to be adding to the legacy of the original films. The most recent sequel, "Cinderella," is set to be released next year. The Disney empire stretches far and wide these days, and characters like Baby Yoda and Tony Stark sit alongside Mickey Mouse and Cinderella in theme parks. Disney plays up “Disney Magic” as part of its brand

But when every major franchise in America is lumped together as Disney magic, what’s left? The original 1940 Fantasia was one of Walt Disney’s most ambitious passion projects turned box-office failures. Lilo & Stitch was so damn weird that the filmmakers basically hid it from the rest of the company. And even The Little Mermaid, the film that kickstarted the Disney Renaissance, was a risk. Nostalgia isn’t a bad thing, nor is it entirely at odds with Walt Disney. Even in his quest for innovation, Walt was a nostalgic guy. I, certainly, am not immune to Disney nostalgia

I have multiple Disney-themed plushies. I teared up when I watched Once Upon a Studio. Nostalgia is a potent ingredient, and it works best in the Disney recipe for success when it's on the side. For most of the past century, Walt Disney Studios was a movie studio first, and a storefront, streaming service, and theme-park empire second. It feels like that balance has shifted over the last decade. Disney fans have so many separate, individualized desires, it’s impossible for the company to focus on meeting every single one of them

Even though people cry out for the good old days, what they’re really missing is the feeling of discovering something new — that first viewing of a movie that will become a lasting favorite. Disney made a lot of costly mistakes along the way. But each of those mistakes was an opportunity that helped usher in the great movies the studio is known for. You don’t get to a hundred-year legacy by playing it safe. You need to have faith and trust in storytelling. And a little pixie dust doesn't hurt, either

A field guide to the vampire authors who were probably vampires themselves. From Robert Southey to Anne Rice, vampire fiction has a long and distinguished pedigree in English. Was night-stalking Lord Byron secretly a daywalker? Could it be that Anne Rice’s innate understanding of deathless sexiness is itself a result of her fellowship with the undead? The concept of vampires goes back at least as far as Balkan folktales from the middle ages or earlier. Its history in the English-speaking world began in earnest with Dr. John William Polidori’s novel The Vampyre at the turn of the 19th century

Polidori had always had an adorably puppy dog-ish devotion to Byron. So it's not surprising to see his depiction of the book’s vampiric main character, Lord Ruthven, take on a certain erotic charge. Ruthven is described as cruelly sadistic, mockingly contemptuous of others, yet desperately desired by those around him. Stoker’s own biography is almost the inverse of his noble-born immortal count. Born to a middle-class Protestant Irish family in the 1840s, Stoker”s life grew pridedly enigmatic. The bloodsucking conversion process (targeted, invariably, against either women or the more effeminate among the male set) reads alarmingly like seduction

Stoker’s second novel, ’Salem’S Lot’, was published in 1974. The book is about a man who returns to his childhood home in Maine. It was inspired by his interest in the Hermetic Society. In addition to famously dwelling in the least accessible reaches of rural New England, King has also been frozen in an ageless state that could fairly be described as “non-specifically ancient” Still, given King’s recent and high-profile stances against corporate power and in favor of trans rights, it has been admitted that he makes a strong case for vampire kind

Anne Rice's Interview with the Vampire was a watershed moment for vampire novels. It was the first time a mainstream book had prominently featured vampires that were gay, campy, and unapologetically fabulous. Rice had a famously ambivalent relationship with the Catholicism of her youth, first turning away from it in favor of sexy gothic monster books. Laurell K. Hamilton's Anita Blake series is more like the merrily obscene aesthetic of a 1970s grindhouse flick. Her characters bash, slaughter, and jump one another's bones (animated or otherwise), but it's all in good fun

Hamilton also wrote a series of Christ-themed religious fiction. With her books, the sexy and violent vampire has reached a Looney Tunes stage of madcap romp, and audiences can’t get enough of it.

Concert movies are the future of pop music fandom. Inflation, Ticketmaster’s monopolistic practices, and increased demand after COVID-related touring delays have coincided to create a perfect storm of ticket-buying agony. Geography, economics, health and safety concerns, and physical or mental ability make stadium and arena concerts infeasible or unaffordable. In July, Pitchfork reported that the average cost of a ticket for the North American leg of Swift’s Eras Tour was $3,801. That's a 2,321% increase from her 2018 Reputation Stadium Tour, where the average resale price for North American shows was $157

'In God We Trust' has been an official statement of national faith since the Civil War and the official motto of the United States since 1956. Pastor Jesse Bradley of Grace Community Church in Auburn, Washington, near Seattle, says faith is more valuable than money, technology and entertainment. Survey after survey, along with countless anecdotal examples, paint an unmistakable picture of an America growing less religious and more secular. "Closeness with God is reflected and expressed in our relationships, the laws of the land, and morality," says Pastor Bradley. "In God We Trust" is not a uniquely Judeo-Christian American concept

Some form of it has been expressed by other cultures, nations and faiths throughout history. The motto traces its roots to the Old Testament, the foundational text of Western Civilization. Faith in God in the United States was not just a statement of religious faith, but a declaration of national identity and human equality. "The motto doesn't nullify the freedom to choose faith. Nothing is forced," said the pastor. "We are all equal before God," he said. The phrase first appeared on coins from the U. S. Mint in 1865 at the end of the Civil War

Twitch star Turner "Tfue" Tenney has announced his retirement. Tenney was the face of Fortnite and one of the game's most popular players. His exit marks the end of an era for the games industry. Tenney rode a Fortnite wave that raised billions of dollars for Epic Games. A few years later, the publisher laid off 830 of its employees. Tenney spurred headlines after joining FaZe Clan, a gaming lifestyle brand so lucrative it was endorsed by Snoop Dogg

The idea that Twitch has lost its way after an ostensible golden era is an easy narrative that misses something much starker. If Twitch is in trouble in 2023, it’s not because things have gotten worse. Everything you’re seeing is the natural progression of an unsustainable system. The prognosis has always been terminal; we’ve just refused to see it. Fortnite was initially a flop before Epic perfected the formula. The cadence also let Epic quickly adapt Fortnite to whatever was trending or novel. The conditions that made everything possible were unique, yet immaterial to publishers who could only imagine profits

Twitch both shapes that discourse while also becoming the very met of the discourse, he says. He adds: “There is inherently [a] vicious and negative cycle for everyone involved” Games as a whole are getting longer and more expensive. It takes multiple studios to keep yearly live-service franchises like Call of Duty afloat.

All 10 of the most-watched games on Twitch in 2022 were live-service games with regular updates. As Fortnite took off, developers at Epic Games said that they experienced months of crunch that required 70-to-100-hour weeks to produce that industry-shaping content. Diablo 4's developers say they also underwent crunch to ship the game. According to the developer, streamers help old games transform into new and visible moments. Developers need live-service games to stay in the conversation, because the base experience can worsen without a persistent player base

VTubing exploded onto the wider North American and European markets when Cover Corporation launched the English branch of Hololive Production in 2020. Even high-profile content creators like Pokimane pivoted toward using digital avatars weeks after Hololives’s first  VTubing. VTubing-related content on the platform shot up by some 350% between January and August 2022. Despite this, some have argued that theVTubing bubble has all but burst.

Agencies for VTubers manage their talents, often assigning them a manager that helps organize interviews, collaborations, paid promotions, and ad content on streams. Sometimes they can be financial advisors, but that is not always the case, as money made through agencies may include subscription or merchandise sales. In August, the parent company of Hololive, Cover Corporation, announced that two talents would be graduating from its Holostars division barely a year after debuting.

However, it is often strictly tied to the avatar associated with said agency. Hololive and Nijisanji give creators very little freedom. Newer agencies such as Idol allow talents to create their own concepts. Hololive reported 50% growth in its 2023 financial report. Time will tell if larger agencies like Hololive and Nijisanji will allow their talents to break the mold. To prevent further stagnation, this not-so-niche form of content creation needs to reinvent itself

“What’s interesting about the Sphere idea is that they are planning multiple spheres, and then you can think about shows being able to move from sphere to sphere,” Lipson says. Stufish Entertainment Architects' U2 show is elementary in real terms, despite its technological complexity. The screens, for example, are a bespoke assembly of state-of-the-art screens. But behind those screens are “a whole new kind of speaker,” Lipson says. When in cinema mode, it utilises the full range of haptics.

Fr. Dan Reehil is a priest of the Diocese of Nashville. He received exorcism training at Ateneo Pontificio Regina Apostolorum in Rome. "Angels, demons, spirits and souls do exist and they can have an impact on our life," he says. The Church distinguishes between two forms of exorcisms, said Reehil. Exorcisms are either "major" or "minor," he said. There are three levels of demonic incursion: temptation, obsession and possession. A major exorcism is performed only for one, who is demonstrably possessed. The Ouija board was first developed in the late 19th century as a parlor game

The board consists of an alphabet, the words "yes," "no," "goodbye" and the numbers "9" and "3" In 1890, a Baltimore spiritualist and medium named Helen Peters asked the talking board what she should call it. The board responded "O-U-I-J-A," which it said meant "good luck" The Ouija board was patented the following year. The boards were mass-produced by the Kennard Novelty Company, which was sold to Parker Brothers in 1967

Today, the Ouija board is produced by Hasbro, which markets the product as a way to communicate with the "spirit world" "Ouija boards should not be viewed in the same way as a typical board game," Fr. Reehil said. "The very action of using [the Ouija board] has profound spiritual consequences [that are] beyond our control," he said. The victims were left with night terrors, suicidal ideation, despair. One man was impaled with chicken bones in his leg that flew across the kitchen. "Stay away from all forms of occult practices — and stay close to God," said Reehil

Sammo is truly one of the greatest directors to ever do it, but he doesn’t get the proper credit globally because of the genres (and nation) he’s primarily worked in.

inspired by Żuławski's own tumultuous divorce in 1976 and his subsequent struggles with suicidal ideation, the film blurs the line between the autobiographical and the phantasmagorical. Possession is an essential watch for any serious horror fan. Set squarely in the zombie-craze of the mid-2000s, the movie’s undead creatures owe quite a bit to the raving cannibal infected of 28 Days Later. While many found-footage movies obscure their scariest moments, Possession uses the format to enhance its creeping dread. The film is set during the height of the Cold War

We’re Not Alike shows another promising side to McRae’s sound, a post-punky thing built on an Interpol-ish riff that slyly builds into something anthemic.

I/O is his first solo album of new original material in over two decades. Some wags are calling it his Chinese Democracy, but the rarely punctual Axl Rose only took a comparatively brisk 18 years to release the follow-up to Use Your Illusion. There's a palpable sense of mortality on I/O. Gabriel is 73, and he’s mining a seam of material about taking stock, feeling at one with the world and the realisation that love is all we need.

Legendary composer Danny Elfman played Coachella in 2022. Elfman is behind projects like Batman, Spider-Man, The Simpsons, and countless Tim Burton films. Images of the roaring composer were quick to go viral on social media. "Nobody else even came close to bringing that level of chaotic pageantry," wrote Vulture at the time. Danny Elfman was a member of new wave band Oingo Boingo. When he left the band to pivot to composing, he also left behind his live music career. What brought him back? Henry Selick’s The Nightmare Before Christmas. Elfman joined Burton early on in the development of The Nightmare Before Christmas. The soundtrack became a cross-holiday staple every October through December. In 2005, he premiered the highly baroque Serenada Schizophrana. In 2008, he wrote the music for the American Ballet Thea. In 2013, the former Oingo Boingo frontman returned to the stage at the Royal Albert Hall to perform his scores from Tim Burton movies. This included select numbers from The Nightmare Before Christmas, which he sang in full

Elfman has vehemently denied the accusations against him as “vicious and wholly false. ” Oingo Boingo frontman Elfman is back as Jack Skellington. He performed at Coachella earlier this year. He said it was his first time onstage as “myself’ in 27 years. The act is not a return to form. It is the final form. Elfman’s rock star persona will explode out of nowhere with the rhythm of his percussive scores.

Hollywood has been in a comedic rut in recent years, with fewer and fewer notable releases from big studios. We've compiled a list of the best comedy movies you can watch at home, scraping streaming services like Netflix, Hulu, Prime Video, and HBO Max. The animated buddy comedy came out during the transition point between the Disney Renaissance and the eventual wave of crass CG movies ushered in by Shrek. Even though it failed spectacularly in theaters, home video turned it into a cult classic and a meme powerhouse

To make matters worse, the remaining money is missing, and a  father is missing. Hepburn and Grant, two famously talented and charming stars, are at their most charming and talented in Charade. Grant’s initial discomfort with their age gap — 25 years, a still-not-uncommon chasm in Hollywood — resulted in rewrites to the script to make clear that Reggie was pursuing him

Super Mario Bros. Wonder is a loyal continuation of the plumber’s work in the 2D platformer genre. Dash from left to right, jump over pits, concuss enemies, collect the occasional power-up.

Mario multiplayer shines as a solo experience, but like other recent 2D Mario games, Wonder allows up to four players to play together. The humanoid characters are like M&Ms — they have different exteriors but effectively play the same.

With Super Mario 64, 3D Mario games became the de facto labs for Nintendo’s greatest experimentation. 2D Mario, conversely, defaulted to a vessel for nostalgia.
