After losing her leg to the flu, Virginia woman urges people to get vaccinated: ‘Don’t waste time’

For most of the millions of people who get the flu each year in the U. S. , the virus brings a few days of fever, body aches and weakness before it goes away. But for some, the influenza virus can lead to severe illness, hospitalization — even death. Allison Miller knows these risks all too well. This year marks a decade since serious complications from the flu led to a life-changing loss for the Virginia-based communications director

HAVE A COLD OR FLU? HERE'S HOW TO KNOW IF YOU CAN STILL WORK OUT: ‘USE THE NECK CHECK’

At age 33, Miller was a healthy young woman when she came down with a sore throat and headache. When her symptoms got worse, she went into urgent care for a chest X-ray, but it showed nothing alarming. "It looked like it was just some sort of run-of-the-mill stuff — they gave me some prescription cough syrup and said to let them know if it got worse," she said in an interview with Fox News Digital

Back at home that night, Miller started feeling worse — and began having intense back pain. "Thinking it was the flu or something I could get over, I kept waiting to turn the corner — like, this is the worst of it. It'll get better. And clearly that wasn't the case," she said.

"I remember being loaded into the ambulance — and then I really don't remember a whole lot after that for about three weeks to a month thereafter," she said. "It just escalated very quickly. "

As Miller would later learn, her influenza had caused bilateral bacterial pneumonia — which affects both lungs and is more severe than viral pneumonia. This led to sepsis, which quickly turned to septic shock. "All of my organs were shutting down," Miller said. "Within a short amount of time, I was in the ICU and they were doing everything they could

Ultimately, doctors had to amputate Miller’s left leg above the knee — all while she was still in a medically induced coma. "By the time I came out of it, it had been three weeks. I awoke in a very hazy position — and I didn’t have a left leg," she recalled. She spent another two months in the hospital and then had to do weeks of inpatient rehabilitation

In addition to the amputation, Miller still suffers from permanent lung damage and below-average heart function. "There was some permanent organ damage because of the strain of the virus, as it was such a severe case of pneumonia," she said. "I have a terminal lung condition that needs regular treatment. "

She added, "It's manageable, but it's something I will forever deal with. "

The experience has given Miller a "renewed sense of how quickly things could change" — and has taught her to be as proactive as possible about her health to prevent a terrible outcome

Overall, Miller said she thinks most people don’t understand how severe the flu can be — so they don’t recognize the signs that they need immediate medical attention. "In my case, it was very quick — it was within 24 to 48 hours that it went from just coming on, to me being in the hot seat. "

Ozempic, Wegovy may be linked to stomach paralysis and other digestive issues in large-scale study

Popular weight loss drugs like Wegovy and Ozempic could increase the risk of stomach paralysis as well as several other serious gastrointestinal conditions , according to a study published Thursday in JAMA. This was the first large epidemiological (disease-related) study to examine these adverse effects in non-diabetic patients using the drugs specifically for weight loss, per a press release from The University of British Columbia (UBC). The risk was linked to all semaglutides, a class of medications known as GLP-1 receptor agonists — including Ozempic (prescribed for diabetes management ), Wegovy (prescribed for weight loss), Rybelsus (type 2 diabetes) and Saxenda (weight loss). OZEMPIC DIABETES AND WEIGHT LOSS MEDICATION UNDER INVESTIGATION AFTER A FEW REPORTS OF SUICIDAL THOUGHTS

Stomach paralysis, officially known as gastroparesis, prevents the nerves and muscles in the stomach from moving food into the small intestine, which keeps digestion from occurring, as described on Cleveland Clinic’s website

In addition to stomach paralysis, the drugs were linked to a greater risk of pancreatitis (inflammation of the pancreas) and bowel obstruction, which prevents food from passing through the small or large intestine, the release stated. UBC researchers examined the health insurance claim records for approximately 16 million U. S. patients who were prescribed Ozempic, Wegovy or either semaglutide or liraglutide medications across a 14-year span (between 2006 and 2020). The researchers could not assess whether the condition was temporary or permanent. Compared to another weight loss drug , bupropion-naltrexone, those who took a GLP-1 agonist were 3

Mahyar Etminan, associate professor in the Departments of Ophthalmology & Visual Sciences and Medicine at UBC, told Fox News Digital. There are medications that can be used to help with the condition, he added. Although these complications were rare, the researchers found them concerning, given that millions of people are using these medications worldwide. The number of people in the U. S. using GLP-1 agonists for either diabetes or obesity reached 40 million in 2022, they noted. "These drugs are becoming increasingly accessible, and it is concerning that, in some cases, people can simply go online and order these kinds of medications when they may not have a full understanding of what could potentially happen," said first author Mohit Sodhi, a graduate of UBC’s experimental medicine program, in the release.

The researchers recommend that regulatory agencies and drugmakers consider updating the warning labels for their products, which currently don’t include the risk of gastroparesis. "This is critical information for patients to know so they can seek timely medical attention and avoid serious consequences," said Sodhi. The decision about whether to take the drug in spite of these risks will depend on each patient’s individual situation, the researchers said. "This decision should be individually assessed," said Etminan

TEEN GIRLS ARE STRUGGLING WITH MENTAL ILLNESS AT RECORD LEVELS, WITH MANY 'PERSISTENTLY SAD,' DATA REVEALS

In the years since the COVID pandemic began, children and teens are experiencing depression and anxiety more than ever before, according to Schalley. "Here at Children’s, our patients ages 11 and older are screening at risk of depression and/or suicide at nearly 30%," she said. Each patient who receives a mental health assessment in the emergency department at Children's Nebraska is offered the chance to participate in Caring Contacts, said Schalley. About 98% of families agree to join the program, she said

Key benefits of AI in health care

Patel said he views AI as a "powerful instrument" that helps magnify physicians’ capabilities rather than replacing them. "One of AI's primary strengths is its ability to recognize patterns that might escape the human eye," he said. "Whether it's intricate anomalies in medical imaging or subtle patterns in patient histories, AI can pinpoint details that make a significant difference in diagnosis and treatment. "

The technology also helps providers by sifting through and analyzing vast volumes of information, far more than what would be humanly possible, Patel said. It also automates mundane and routine tasks, allowing health care professionals to redirect their focus to the patient, he noted.

Early risk detection is another key benefit. "AI tools can predict potential health risks by analyzing a combination of genetic, behavioral and environmental factors, facilitating early interventions and potentially saving lives," Patel said. As well, AI can help enable the delivery of personalized medicine and proactive preventative care, he noted

"We were hopeful to see some improvements in pathology, but did not expect such profound effects in reducing plaques and inflammation and improving memory," she went on. "The effects of time-restricted feeding on lower amyloid pathology were also measurable in blood using markers found in the clinic, which was another important finding. "

"Sustaining healthy sleep and eating habits that are more synchronized with the natural environment are vital in a society that is constantly exposed to food, light and shift work," said Desplats. Previous studies have supported this association between fasting and reduced Alzheimer’s risk. Last year, a study led by the USC Leonard Davis School of Gerontology in Los Angeles also found that mice that followed a fasting diet showed lower levels of "plaques and tangles" in the brain, reduced brain inflammation and better performance on cognitive tests. "Cycles of a fasting-mimicking diet (FMD) had strong effects against Alzheimer’s symptoms in two different types of Alzheimer’s mouse models," the lead author of that study, USC biogerontologist Dr. Valter Longo, told Fox News Digital. "Fasting decreases pro-aging factors that are secreted after we eat, which can slow down the aging of the brain. "

"In mice, the effects of FMD cycles were very strong and wide, meaning they affected both learning and memory and also Alzheimer’s pathology peptides/proteins (amyloid and tau)

Based on these findings, Longo recommends that people talk to their neurologist about considering fasting-mimicking diets and other nutrition-based approaches in support of standard-of-care drugs and therapies. "Especially for Alzheimer’s disease, for which pharmacological interventions have had very limited efficacy, it will be very important to continue to study fasting-mimicking diets and other dietary interventions that can make drugs more effective," he added.

5 myths about ketamine, the drug tied to Matthew Perry's death, according to doctors

After Matthew Perry’s cause of death was listed as "acute effects of ketamine" on Friday, experts are speaking out about misconceptions surrounding the drug. (Other conditions that contributed to Perry's death, according to the autopsy report, included "coronary artery disease [and] buprenorphrine effects. " Also, "prescription medications and loose pills" were found at the residence, the report said. )

Ketamine is primarily used as an anesthetic during surgical procedures — but in recent years it's been used as a remedy for treatment-resistant depression. WHAT IS KETAMINE, THE DRUG THAT KILLED MATTHEW PERRY ON OCTOBER 28?

The Alcohol and Drug Foundation (ADF) describes ketamine as a "dissociative drug," which means it causes people to feel "separated or detached" from their bodies or physical surroundings. While it is also used illegally as a recreational drug , experts say ketamine is generally not dangerous when used as prescribed

"The concentration of ketamine found in Matthew Perry’s blood was sufficient to cause loss of consciousness and lack of responsiveness to external stimulation," Lewis Nelson, chair of the Department of Emergency Medicine and chief of medical toxicology at Rutgers New Jersey Medical School, said in a statement provided to Fox News Digital. "This explains why he slipped under the water and did not awaken. Ketamine does not generally cause death from cardiac or respiratory effects, but rather from associated injury. "

2: Ketamine is powerfully addictive

Ketamine is "legally recognized as having the potential for abuse and for both psychological and physical dependence," according to the American Addiction Centers website. Johnson, however, noted that ketamine is a "moderately addictive substance. "

He told Fox News Digital, "Even long-term users typically only develop a behavioral or psychological dependence. Physical dependence can occur, but usually the withdrawal signs are mild to moderate. "

Dr. Sandhya Prashad, president of the American Society Of Ketamine Physicians, Psychotherapists and Practitioners (ASKP3) in Florida, said there is "an extremely low risk of addiction, craving or withdrawal" when ketamine is used in low doses in a monitored clinical setting. "Abuse of ketamine occurs when it is self-administered in high or frequent doses without supervision or monitoring, which leads to addiction ," she told Fox News Digital. Myth No 3: Ketamine can be self-prescribed and purchased online

Ketamine should only be obtained and administered by a licensed and experienced medical doctor, Johnson said

"In those settings, it is best delivered by the IV route, where the dose can be calculated accurately. "

When purchasing ketamine outside a doctor’s prescription, there is also the risk of receiving a tainted product, experts warned.

4: Intranasal or micro-dosing is safe for recreational use

While using small doses of ketamine may seem safer than the larger doses given via IV, Johnson warned that when this drug is self-administered, there is a danger of exceeding safe limits. "The total cumulative dose could end up being higher than a standard dose of a medically administered intravenous dose," he told Fox News Digital. Intranasal use can also lead to "more aggressive drug-seeking" behaviors, Johnson warned, as the "high" of taking the ketamine is paired with cues in the user’s environment — which are not present in a medical office. Like other medications, such as opiates or benzodiazepines, ketamine has the potential to be abused, Sullivan agreed. "Ketamine should only be used within the confines of a close relationship between a patient and an experienced prescriber," he said, citing the position reaffirmed by ASKP3. Myth No

5: It’s hard to kick the habit

"Weaning off ketamine is typically not too difficult, as the medicine has a half-life of three to four hours, and most is eliminated by the body in a single day," said Johnson. "Ketamine should only be used within the confines of a close relationship between a patient and an experienced prescriber. "

Gradual dose titrations of ketamine — in which the amounts are slowly increased or decreased — are recommended for starting and stopping the medication, the expert noted

When ketamine becomes dangerous

Ketamine can become dangerous in a few ways, according to experts. "First, if a patient has access to use it at home for pain or mood, this can increase the likelihood of developing a physical or psychological dependence," Sullivan told Fox News Digital. Experts recommend that home use of ketamine is only prescribed for select patients — who should be closely monitored with regular face-to-face office visits. "Another way it can become dangerous is if a patient uses too large of a dose in an unsupervised setting, where they may put themselves at risk for accidents, such as falls or drownings," said Sullivan.

Mixing ketamine with other medicines can also be dangerous, Johnson warned. For example, when mixed with opiates, it can have a stronger sedative effect, and combining ketamine with stimulants can worsen cardiovascular effects, he said. In particular, ketamine mixed with buprenorphine can enhance sedation and lead to unresponsiveness, said Johnson

It is important for people to recognize the distinction between different uses of the drug, according to Prashad. "In reality, the ways in which ketamine is used for anesthesia versus depression versus abuse are all very different in terms of dosage and frequency. "

ULTRA-PROCESSED FOOD CONSUMPTION LINKED TO HIGHER RISK OF DEATH FROM OVARIAN, BREAST CANCERS: NEW STUDY

That’s close to the addiction levels seen for alcohol and tobacco, noted the study article, which was published in the journal BMJ. Ultra-processed foods are those that are high in carbohydrates and fats, such as candy, ice cream and potato chips. The study suggests that some people’s consumption of these foods may meet the criteria for substance use disorder , resulting in the "biopsychological mechanisms of addiction and clinically significant problems. "

Part of the reason that ultra-processed foods have addictive properties is that they deliver fats and carbs to the gut much faster than minimally processed foods, the researchers wrote. These foods also contain flavor and texture additives that could make them more addictive. DEPRESSION RISK SPIKES FOR THOSE WHO EAT THESE UNHEALTHY FOODS, STUDY FINDS: ‘NOT A COINCIDENCE’

Although she believes that no single food is addictive, Palinski-Wade acknowledged that foods that are high in added sugar or added fats tend to be associated with the strongest cravings and desire. "These foods often trigger the release of feel-good chemicals such as dopamine in the brain, leading to cravings and potentially addictive-like eating behaviors," she said. "As you consume more and more of these foods, you build up a dopamine tolerance, meaning that you will have to eat even more of this food to experience the same pleasure response," Palinksi-Wade said — which can contribute to the development of cravings and loss of control over eating behavior. More research is still needed to fully understand the relationship between food and addiction, the experts all agreed. CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR HEALTH NEWSLETTER

"Ideally, to see if the type of food made a difference, you could run a controlled study with people consuming one meal plan with ultra-processed foods and another with minimally processed foods and then measure their reactions — thoughts about food, rated enjoyment of food, cravings and dopamine levels," she said. Those who are struggling with disordered eating , binge-eating or uncontrolled food cravings should work directly with a therapist or registered dietitian experienced in eating disorders, Palinski-Wade recommended

Cell phone shocker as 97% of kids use their device during school hours and beyond, says study

Mobile phones just might be young people's best friend, whether their parents like it or not. A new study from Common Sense Media, a nonprofit group in San Francisco, California, researched phone usage among a diverse group of 203 kids aged 11 to 17 — and the results were startling, experts say. The researchers found that smartphones have become a "constant companion" for young people, according to a news release, although results varied. Kids spent a median of 4

Licensed clinical social worker Jennifer Kelman in Boca Raton, Florida — who provides expert advice on the Justanswer platform and was not involved in the study — shared some of the negative repercussions of kids spending large amounts of time on their phones.

‘Zoom fatigue’ is common struggle for remote workers. Here’s how to handle it, according to experts

Attending meetings in pajama bottoms might seem like a job perk, but some remote workers have found that videoconferencing for work isn’t all it’s cracked up to be. In the years since the COVID pandemic triggered a spike in telecommuting, many have complained of so-called "Zoom fatigue. "

Thought to be coined by Stanford University professor Jeremy Bailenson, the term refers to a level of exhaustion that comes with interacting with others on camera all throughout the day. REMOTE WORKERS RESIST MONDAY OFFICE HOURS, BUT BUILDING 'ORGANIZATIONAL CULTURE' IS KEY, SAYS EXECUTIVE

Dr. Kyle Elliott, a tech career coach in San Francisco, defines Zoom fatigue as "incessant tiredness or lack of energy as a result of spending a large quantity of time on Zoom. "

Additional symptoms can include physical tension (including headaches, eye strain and stiffness), moodiness, a sense of disengagement or difficulty concentrating, according to Dr. Julia Corcoran, a licensed clinical psychologist and board-certified coach, who is currently serving as the director of clinical strategy and experience at Modern Health in San Francisco

And in July of that year, at UPMC Children’s Hospital of Pittsburgh, little 2-year-old Lucas received the liver of 3-year-old Olivia Swedberg, who had passed away a day earlier of brain cancer. "I'm in awe when someone can take their suffering and turn it into something beautiful by donating and giving someone a second chance," said Goeller

For "eight beautiful years," Goeller said, Lucas experienced a normal life as a happy, healthy boy. "He was able to do things that he never could do before," she said. "He went from watching out of windows to being an active participant in life. "

"

But all of that changed this year, when his routine medical scans and blood work indicated that his liver had begun to fail. "His failing liver is affecting his lung function and his ammonia levels," Goeller told Fox News Digital. "That would be drastic for anyone, but for a child who's growing and cognitively developing, it is devastating to [his] development. "

Dr. George Mazariegos, chief of pediatric transplantation at UPMC Children's Hospital of Pittsburgh, said Lucas is experiencing some of the more subtle changes of liver failure

"Those include not being able to grow normally and not getting the proper levels of oxygen to his body and brain, because the blood is being shunted away from the liver," he told Fox News Digital. "Those are important and potentially life-threatening complications. "

As of now, Lucas is still at home and "managing his symptoms," Mazeriegos said, but the doctor emphasized the importance of his receiving a timely transplant before further complications occur

The Goellers are now seeking support again, launching the "Save Lucas" campaign across social media. And the city of Pittsburgh has rallied once more behind the family, with newly donated billboards and media campaigns. "We're trying to not only save Lucas, but also to build organ donation awareness for both deceased and living donors," said Goeller.

Despite his challenges, young Lucas Goeller remains positive, active and upbeat, continuing to enjoy his love of the outdoors and hunting with his father and his three brothers, aged 12, 8, and 4. "He's always filled with so much joy," his mother said. "We get our strength from him. He encourages all of us to continue to look at the positives in life. "

The ideal living donor for Lucas is someone with type O blood, aged 20 to 49, with a BMI below 30

Challenges facing pediatric transplants

Beyond seeking a liver for their son, the Goellers are looking to raise awareness about the critical need for donors to help the more than 100,000 individuals on the organ donor list. Children on transplant lists in the U. S. face three key challenges, Mazariegos said. TINA TURNER SUFFERED FROM KIDNEY DISEASE BEFORE HER DEATH: 'I HAVE PUT MYSELF IN GREAT DANGER'

"First, there is a great demand for life-saving transplants, and there are 10 times the number of adults on the liver transplant list as there are children," he told Fox News Digital

"This creates a challenge to allocate the right or the best organ for the children who are waiting on the list. "

While Mazariegos noted that the allocation policy is slowly improving, it's still imperfect and doesn't always prioritize children appropriately. Each year, dozens of children in the U. S. die while awaiting a new liver. Mazariegos is determined to eliminate this "wait list mortality" through the use of partial liver transplants. That's when either a living or deceased donor’s liver is donated to two different recipients. "Saving lives is not about competition — it’s about collaboration

"

Another challenge is that not all the centers in the country have the capacity to perform highly complex transplants like the one Lucas needs. "We need to train centers across the country on the techniques that will allow them to transplant these children," Mazariegos said. Both the Goeller family and the UPMC doctors stressed the importance of raising organ donor awareness so that more families register as organ donors. Mazariegos noted that people need to be made aware of living donation, which is when donors give part of their liver to a recipient

In 2018, UPMC started a learning network, the Starzl Network for Excellence in Pediatric Transplantation, in honor of Dr. Thomas Starzl, who is recognized as the father of transplantation. "This is an effort to level the playing field and extend the expertise to centers that want to provide the same level of care their patients deserve. "

In Pennsylvania alone , 18 children are waiting for liver transplants, while 300 children are on the list nationwide, Goeller pointed out. "Life-saving donation is only possible through somebody else's love," she said

She said she hopes "this campaign will inspire others to keep the conversation going and keep talking about Lucas and about other children and adults who need transplants. "

She added, "Saving lives is not about competition — it’s about collaboration. It’s going to take more than a village to get this message across the entire world. "
