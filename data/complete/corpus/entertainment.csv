UPDATE: Nov. 27, 2023, 5:00 a.m. EST This post has been updated with all of the latest Cyber Monday deals available at Amazon.

Amazon is dragging out the year's biggest shopping holiday(s) into 11 days of deals.

The retail giant began its Black Friday sale in the early morning of Friday, Nov. 17 (a week ahead of schedule) and was on top of making the switch to Cyber Monday language in the wee hours of Saturday, Nov. 25. Official Cyber Monday mode, which is currently on through Monday, Nov. 27, includes both a ton of deals carried over from Black Friday plus some new ones.

We're curating a running list of Amazon's best Cyber Weekend deals, spotlighting some of our favorites and noting when good deals inevitably sell out. Read on for the full rundown, and check back often: We're going to be updating this story incessantly as the sale continues, as well as our even bigger (if you can imagine) list of Cyber Monday deals across more retailers.

Note: All newly added deals are marked with a ✨, while deals with a 🔥 have dropped to an all-time low price. Amazon's invite-only deals for Prime members are marked with a 📨. Deals with a strikeout were either sold out or expired at the time of writing.

Why we like it

An Echo Show is a subtle yet game-changing addition to any room — and for less than $40 with this rollover Black Friday to Cyber Monday deal, there's little reason to not make your life easier. The smart screen responds to Alexa commands that are particularly handy when your hands are full, like asking for measurement conversions mid-cooking, checking the weather mid-rushing out the door, or turning off your smart lights with a sleeping kid in hand. Plus, it's got a 5.5-inch screen and better sound than its predecessor, making it perfect for watching videos or video calling friends and family.

Now that the 64GB 9th generation iPad has been going in and out of stock (you might be able to find it on sale for $229.99), our new favorite iPad deal at Amazon is the 10th generation 64GB model for $349. Compared to the 9th gen, the 10th gen classic iPad has a slightly bigger screen that's now also a Liquid Retina display (10.9 inches versus 10.2 inches), a faster A14 Bionic chip for smoother multitasking, and USB-C charging.

This 65-inch Fire TV from Amazon hit its lowest ever price this month, and we're not mad about it. With a 66 percent five-star review rating, it's got much to love: Including stunning 4K QLED resolution, adaptive brightness that adjusts to the lighting of your room, the ability to project famous art or personal pics on it when not streaming anything, and, of course, that quintessential Alexa voice control.

MacBooks aside (which are all listed above in the Apple section), another stellar Cyber Monday laptop deal at Amazon is the lightweight Microsoft Surface Laptop Go 3 for $599.99. This 25% discount drops the 2023 version to the regular asking price of our favorite budget laptop, the older Surface Go 2. Compared to the Go 2, the Go 3's Intel Core i5 processor is 12th gen versus the Go 2's 11th gen, harnessing better speeds and solid power for most everyday work or school tasks. On the outside, the Go 3 is definitely giving MacBook Air — the main difference being that the Go 3's screen is a touchscreen.

Narrowing down a headphones upgrade from so many on-sale options is less overwhelming when you've confirmed that you want to stick with a super premium, super reputable brand like Bose — but also that you want to stick to a budget. There's only one pair of Bose over-ear headphones you can grab for just under $200, and that's the QuietComfort 45s at a record-low price of $199. This classic pair secures top-of-the-line ANC, 20 hours of battery life, and all-day comfort for less than half of the AirPods Max's sale price.

entertainment,Jeffrey Parkin,2023-12-18T17:14:20+00:00,"Picking the best class in Baldurs Gate 3 is one of the most important decisions you’ll make in the game — and you have to do it right at the start, with minimal context to work off.

Your class mostly determines how your character will fight in Baldur’s Gate, but with 12 classes — and 46 subclasses total across them all — it’s not really an easy decision. Here’s what to know about finding the best class (and the best subclass) for you in Baldur’s Gate 3.

All BG3 classes are ‘good’

The classes in Baldur’s Gate 3 — and in pen-and-paper D&D, for that matter — are all fairly well-balanced. There’s no single best class (barrelmancer aside) in Baldur’s Gate 3, and the game gives you as many opportunities for creative problem solving as it does for punching. Finding the best class really just boils down to how you want to play. Even when playing solo, you’ll still manage the rest of your party, so you’ll get to experiment with multiple classes at once.

BG3 classes have strengths outside of combat

Your character’s class is mostly about combat, but the underlying Ability Score that it relies on affects the other skills you’ll use to interact with the world. Baldur’s Gate 3 assigns your Ability Scores automatically (though you can tweak it in the character creator), so each class’s primary ability will be your highest score.

Bards and Sorcerers are both Charisma-based classes, for example. Their high Charisma will also make them good at skills like Persuasion, Deception, and Intimidation. Out of combat, those classes will be better at talking their way out of (and into) trouble and lying. Wisdom-based classes like Clerics or Druids will be more insightful and perceptive of their surroundings.

Should you play a custom or an Origin character in BG3?

Baldur’s Gate 3 gives you the option to play as an Origin character, meaning you can just choose one of the NPCs from your party and play as them right out of the gate. It’s a perfectly fine way to play if you really don’t want to go through the process of picking out a race and background for your character.

That said, you’ll also be limited to that character’s predetermined story. It’s a bit more work at the beginning, but you’ll have a lot more freedom to experience the entire story of Baldur’s Gate 3 if you make a custom character. With all that in mind...

Which BG3 class (and subclass) is best for you?

Distinctions like caster vs. puncher or melee vs. ranged don’t really work for Baldur’s Gate 3 (or D&D). There’s a lot of overlap in the classes — especially as you level up. And that means there’s no easy way to say one class is best (or even better). Instead, focus on what you want to do (or how you want to do it), and go from there.

We’ll list them all below ranked (subjectively) by how difficult they are to play. We’ve put the caster classes toward the more difficult end simply because they’ve got more to manage with their spells and spell slots — punching things is easier than memorizing spells.

Best melee class for beginners: Fighter

Nothing against Fighters here, but they’re the easiest class to wrap your head around. You’re not going to need to manage spells or Ki Points. Instead, you’ll see a baddie and then you’ll stab said baddie.

Fighters start out as a very straightforward melee class. With high strength, they get all armors and shields, and choose a method of combat to focus on (and get buffs to). They also get a way to heal themselves and way to get a second attack once per short rest.

At level 3, you get to choose a subclass from Battle Master, Eldritch Knight, and Champion. Battlemasters get a set of Superiority Dice that let you perform Maneuvers to control the flow of battle and the battlefield. Eldritch Knights add magic into the Fighter’s arsenal. Champions keep it simple with a better change to deal a Critical Hit (for double damage).

Champion is the best subclass for a Fighter. Consult our Fighter build guide for more details on why, and to see which skills and feats to pick.

Best ranged class for beginners: Ranger

Rangers are agile hunters that focus on Dexterity as their primary Ability. Rangers are an interesting mix of melee, stealth, skills, and magic. That also makes it harder to get the most out of the class. Rangers get Light and Medium Armors and some of the more basic weapons.

Rangers also make a lot of choices during character creation (and leveling up) that determine how they play. At level 1, you’ll choose a Favored Enemy — a preferred quarry — and a preferred environment that grants you some magical spells.

At level 3, you get to choose a Ranger subclass from Beast Master, Gloom Stalker, or Hunter. Beast Masters get a Companion animal that fights along side you, Gloom Stalkers focus on stealth, and Hunters get to specialize their melee abilities.

Hunter is the best subclass for a Ranger. Consult our Ranger build guide for more details on why, and to see which skills and feats to pick.

Best class for damage: Barbarian

Barbarians are all about combat. They get light and medium armor (and shields), but they’ve also got the option to keep their AC up even without wearing armor. For weapons, Barbarians get a wide range of heavy hitters like battleaxes and warhammers. Every Barbarian gets the Rage ability that lets them hit even harder and reduce damage during combat (and only during combat).

When you hit level 3, you get to choose from the Wildheart, Berserker, or Wild Magic subclasses. Wildheart lets you modify your Rage ability with animal-themed tweaks like healing, jumping, or a stampede. Berserker is a lot more straightforward and focuses on hitting (extra) things and throwing. And Wild Magic adds a magical flair to your Rage with a random magical effect and improved saving throws against magic for you and your allies.

Berserker is the best subclass for a Barbarian. Consult our Barbarian build guide for more details on why, and to see which skills and feats to pick.

Best class for magic: Druid

Druids are the nature-based casters of Baldur’s Gate 3. Most of their magic is nature- or animal-themed and they get Skills to match. What they lack in armor proficiencies — they only get Light and Medium Armor — they make up for with the ability to shapeshift into a badger, wolf, spider, or cat.

At level 3, Druids pick from the Circle of the Land, Circle of the Moon, and Circle of Spores subclasses. Circle of Land gets you some extra magic and the ability to cast more spells throughout the day, Circle of the Moon adds a bear to the repertoire of animal shapes you can shift into, and Circle of Spores adds in some extra fungus- and decay-based magic.

Circle of the Moon is the best subclass for a Druid. Consult our Druid build guide for more details on why, and to see which skills and feats to pick.

Best class for stealth: Rogue

Rogues are Dexterity-based, sneaky fighters. They only get Light Armor, so they have to focus on staying unseen and quick. Their weapons tend to be simple and focus on ones that have the Finesse type — meaning you can add your Dexterity modifier instead of your Strength. All Rogues get to use Dash (double movement), Disengage (don’t provoke Opportunity Attacks), and Hide as Bonus Actions. They also get Sneak Attack combat actions that let them deal extra damage whenever they have Advantage.

Level 3 Rogues choose from the Thief, Arcane Trickster, and Assassin subclasses. Thief Rogues get an extra bonus action, Arcane Tricksters mix in magic, and Assassins get advantages over surprised or unprepared enemies.

Thief is the best subclass for a Rogue. Consult our Rogue build guide for more details on why, and to see which skills and feats to pick.

Best class for melee and magic: Paladin

Paladins start out mixing in (Divine) magic with their melee abilities. They’re the most magic-focused of the melee classes. They get all armors and shields, along with a good mix of weapons. Choosing from the three subclasses — Oath of the Ancients, Oath of Devotion, and Oath of Vengeance — determines what kind of magic you get. Oath of the Ancients adds in healing magic, Oath of Devotion gets defense-focused magic, and Oath of Vengeance adds offensive magic. Paladins also get a handful of other spells for dealing out even more holy justice.

Oath of the Ancients is the best subclass for a Paladin. Consult our Paladin build guide for more details on why, and to see which skills and feats to pick.

Best class for speed: Monk

Monks are a melee class kind of like Fighters, but with a lot more pizzazz. Their best Ability is Dexterity, so their combat is more martial arts than swordplay. Monks don't get armor and only have a limited set of weapons available, but they make up for it with Unarmed Strikes that deal extra damage. Monks take a little more finesse to play than Fighters.

Monk subclasses unlock at level 3 and include Way of the Four Elements, Way of the Open Hand, and Way of Shadow. Way of the Four Elements mixes in spells with your Monk abilities (and uses renamed spells from the caster classes). Way of the Open Hand expands your attacks to include things like knocking down enemies or pushing them with extra melee attacks. And Way of Shadow makes your Monk sneaky and stealthy (think of it as a ninja subclass).

Way of the Open Palm is the best subclass for a Monk. Consult our Monk build guide for more details on why, and to see which skills and feats to pick.

Best magic class for beginners: Warlock

Warlocks are casters that made a deal with a higher power for their magic. They play a lot like Sorcerers, but with a slight emphasis on more academic Skills and fewer spells. Warlocks get Light Armor, so they’re a little less squishy than Sorcerers.

Like Sorcerers, you’ll pick your Warlock subclass during character creation. You’ll choose from The Fiend, The Great Old One, and The Archfey subclasses that are all themed around where your magic comes from — and determine some of the spells you can use. The Fiend Warlocks get their magic from a demon-like fiend and have hell-themed spells, the Great Old One is more Lovecraftian horror-themed, and the Archfey draws power from a powerful Fey being.

Great Old One is the best subclass for a Sorcerer. Consult our Sorcerer build guide for more details on why, and to see which skills and feats to pick.

Best healer class: Cleric

Clerics are the other side of the Paladin’s mix of magic and melee. They’re not quite as frontline in combat with only Light and Medium armors, but they get more (and more powerful) spells. Clerics also get an extra boost with Channel Divinity that gets them an extra (Divine) magic ability like Turning Undead to drive away zombies or Guided Strike that gives a +10 to Attack Rolls.

When you make a Cleric, you choose a subclass (Domain) from a list of seven: Life, Light, Trickery, Knowledge, Nature, Tempest, and War. Each Domain has different spells, actions, and even proficiencies associated with hit. Broadly, Life Domain focuses on healing, Light emphasizes Radiant and Fire magic (in and out of combat), Trickery is good for sneaking, Knowledge gets extra Skills out of combat and brain-based spells, Nature is flavored a little more like a Druid, Tempest is a little more combat and Thunder damage-focused, and War is all about combat.

Light Domain is the best subclass for a Cleric. Consult our Cleric build guide for more details on why, and to see which skills and feats to pick.

Best support class: Bard

Bards are a specialized kind of caster class that focus more on performance and charm than a weighty list of spells. Bards only get Light Armor and focus on Charisma as their primary stat, so they rarely belong on the front line of a fight. Where Bards come into their own, though, is with Bardic Inspiration — a way to boost the rolls of their allies — and their spells that are a nice mix of utility and offensive magic.

Bards get three subclasses at level 3: College of Lore, College of Valor, and College of Swords. College of Lore Bards get a lot of useful skills to use outside of combat and get to use their Bardic Inspiration to make enemies weaker, College of Valor Bards help their allies hit even harder, and College of Swords Bards focus on a swashbuckling style of combat.

College of Valor is the best subclass for a Bard. Consult our Bard build guide for more details on why, and to see which skills and feats to pick.

Best class for magic damage: Wizard

Wizards are the archetypical caster class. They are the only Intelligence-based class in Baldur’s Gate 3 and have the most spells — and the most spell slots to cast them — of all of the casters. Wizards don’t get any armor and are limited to just daggers and quarterstaffs (quarterstaves?) in combat, so they’re going to rely on magic to do any damage.

Your Wizard subclass is chosen when you create the character. You’ll choose from eight schools of magic: Abjuration, Conjuration, Divination, Enchantment, Evocation, Illusion, Necromancy, and Transmutation. Each subclass gets an extra ability themed to the school of magic. Broadly speaking, Abjuration is about protection and defense, Conjuration is about creating something from nothing, Divination gets to foresee (and change) rolls, Enchantment is about charming and controlling minds, Evocation shapes and controls spells, Illusion is about trickery, Necromancy controls life and death, and Transmutation focuses on alchemy and changing the world around you.

Evocation is the best subclass for a Wizard. Consult our Wizard build guide for more details on why, and to see which skills and feats to pick.

Best class for social interactions: Sorcerer

Sorcerers get their magic from within themselves. Sorcerers are the most flexible and varied in the spells they can use. Their primary Ability is Charisma, so they’re also good at dialogue-heavy encounters out of combat. Sorcerers don’t get any armor, so you’ll have to keep them out of melee combat most of the time.

You’ll pick your Sorcerer subclass when you create your character from the Wild Magic, Draconic Bloodline, and Storm Sorcery subclasses. Wild Magic leans into the chaotic and untamed nature of magic, Draconic Bloodline gives a dragon-based flavor to your magic, and Storm Sorcery lets you Fly whenever you cast a spell.

Draconic Bloodline is the best subclass for a Sorcerer. Consult our Sorcerer build guide for more details on why, and to see which skills and feats to pick.

entertainment,Johnny Yu,2023-12-01T22:53:00+00:00,"The Warlock is one of twelve classes in Baldur’s Gate 3. Warlocks are extreme knowledge-seekers who are willing to form a pact with otherwordly beings in order to gain ancient secrets that’ll bolster their magical arsenal.

To deal with such powerful creatures, Warlocks need to have strong mental power. They need to be able to make a deal with the devil and survive. As such, their primary ability score is Charisma.

There’s no single best class in Baldur’s Gate 3, and the game gives you as many opportunities for creative problem solving as it does for punching. Finding the best class really just boils down to how you want to play. Even when playing solo, you’ll still manage the rest of your party, so you’ll get to experiment with multiple classes at once.

Read on to find out everything you need to know about the Warlock class in Baldur’s Gate 3, and learn all about the best Warlock subclass, feats, and build.

Is Warlock the best class for you in BG3?

Warlocks sacrifice the number of spells that they know for sheer power. Every Warlock spell slot is the same — the highest level available — and they recharge on a short rest instead of a long rest. Warlocks aren’t as versatile as other caster classes, but what they do, they do well.

Warlocks are a great class for you if you want to play a dedicated caster class, but don’t want to deal with all the prep work that classes like Wizards require. You’ll still get to use (a lot of) magic, but you won't have to manage a binder full of spells every morning.

The Fiend

Warlocks with The Fiend subclass have struck a deal with a hellish fiend who strives for corruption and destruction. If you forge a pact with a fiend, you’ll receive a feature exclusive to The Fiend called “Dark One’s Blessing,” which will grant you four temporary hit points whenever you defeat a hostile creature.

The Fiend also has two exclusive spells — Burning Hands and Command.

The Great Old One

Those serving The Great Old One are bound to a mysterious being from the Far Realm, who might not even know you exist, The Great Old One will grant you a feature exclusive to this subclass called “Mortal Reminder,” which will frighten a creature and any nearby enemies after you land a critical hit unless they succeed a Wisdom saving throw.

The Great Old One also has two exclusive spells — Dissonant Whispers and Tasha’s Hideous Laughter.

The Archfey

If you choose The Archfey as your subclass, your patron is a lord or lady of the fey, a creature from before the time of mortal races. If you’re bound to The Archfey, you’ll gain an action named “Fey Presence,” which will charm or frighten nearby foes.

The Archfey also has two exclusive spells — Faerie Fire and Sleep.

Best Warlock subclass and build in BG3

Baldur’s Gate 3 races don’t really have any direct impact on your class, but certain races and subraces come with features that play well with certain classes like extra movement or proficiency with certain weapons. For Warlocks, it’s best to focus on weapon and armor proficiencies:

Drow ’s Drow Weapon Training adds weapons like the rapiers and hand crossbows

’s Drow Weapon Training adds weapons like the rapiers and hand crossbows Humans ’ and Half-Elves ’ Civil Militia add spears, pikes, halberds, and glaives along with shields

’ and ’ Civil Militia add spears, pikes, halberds, and glaives along with shields Githyanki Martial Prodigy means you get medium armor along with longswords and greatswords

Martial Prodigy means you get medium armor along with longswords and greatswords Dwarven Combat Training gets you battleaxes, handaxes, light hammers, and warhammers. The Shield Dwarf subrace also gets you Medium Armor

When you’re creating and leveling up your Warlock, Charisma (for spellcasting) is your most important stat. Your second most important stat kind of depends on how you play outside of combat, but Constitution is also a good option for the hit points — Warlocks, like Sorcerers, have a tendency to be glass cannons. Make Charisma your highest stat and Constitution your second highest.

You’ll pick your Warlock subclass at level 1, but the pact you choose here is actually less important than the Eldritch Invocation you get at level 2 — that said, go with the Great Old One for the most broadly useful features. Your Eldritch Invocation powers up your Eldritch Blast spell — the bread-and-butter spell for Warlocks — and turns it into an Agonizing Blast.

Best Warlock feats in BG3

Every four levels, you’ll get the option to either increase your stats or choose a Feat. Feats are special talents that add features to your character. If you’re happy with your stats and start taking Feats, Warlocks can benefit from:

Actor . Your Charisma Increases by 1, to a maximum of 20. Your Proficiency Bonus is also doubled for Deception and Performance Checks.

. Your Charisma Increases by 1, to a maximum of 20. Your Proficiency Bonus is also doubled for Deception and Performance Checks. Elemental Adept . Your spells ignore Resistance to a damage type of your choice. When you cast spells of that type, you cannot roll a 1.

. Your spells ignore Resistance to a damage type of your choice. When you cast spells of that type, you cannot roll a 1. Moderately Armored . You gain Armor Proficiency with Medium Armor and shields, and your Strength or Dexterity increases by 1, to a maximum of 20.

. You gain Armor Proficiency with Medium Armor and shields, and your Strength or Dexterity increases by 1, to a maximum of 20. Spell Sniper. You learn a cantrip, and the number you need to roll a Critical Hit while attacking is reduced by 1. This effect can stack.

Jada Pinkett Smith has revealed that she and husband Will Smith have been separated for the last seven years.

The Girls Trip star, 52, shared in a new interview with People published on 11 October that she and the King Richard actor, 55, are “still figuring it out” when it comes to their marriage of 26 years. She explained at the time of the 2022 Academy Awards, when Will slapped Chris Rock, they had been separated for six years.

“We’ve been doing some really heavy-duty work together,” Jada said. “We just got deep love for each other and we are going to figure out what that looks like for us.”

The pair have been married since 1997 and share son Jaden, 25, and daughter Willow, 22. The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air star also has a son Trey, 30, whom he shares with his first wife, Sheree Zampino.

As for her children, Jada praised them for how they’ve helped her grow. “My children, they’re little gurus. They’ve taught me a deep sense of self-acceptance,” she told the outlet.

Jada and Will have often opened up about their relationship over the years, and have had very public ups and downs throughout their marriage. Here’s a timeline of their relationship.

1994: Will and Jada meet on the set of The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air

Will and Jada met after she auditioned for the role of Will’s girlfriend on The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air. While she did not get the part, the pair hit it off - despite Will being married to Sheree Zampino at the time, with who he shares son Trey.

“I had a realisation I wasn’t with the person I was supposed to be with,” he told Jada’s Red Table Talk in 2018. “I was sitting in a [bathroom] stall and I was crying and laughing uncontrollably, and I knew [Jada] was the woman I was supposed to be with.”

Will and Jada in 2000 (Getty)

1995: The pair officially begin dating

It wasn’t until 1995 that Will and Jada began seriously dating after Will finalised his divorce from Zampino.

1997: Will and Jada get engaged and married

Will popped the question to Jada in November 1997 before getting married just one month later in Baltimore.

Jada wasn’t initially sold on the idea of marriage. She told People in 2019: “I never wanted to get married. But my mother was like: ‘You have to get married’ - she’s so old-school - and Will wanted a family. So I said: ‘All right, maybe it’s something I should do.’”

1998: Their first child is born

Jada and Will’s first child together, son Jayden, was born in July 1998.

2000: Their second child was born

Jada and Will welcomed daughter Willow in 2000.

2013: Jada denies open marriage rumours (sort of)

After a quiet decade and a half making movies and raising their children, Jada took to Facebook to address rumours she and Will were in an open relationship.

She wrote: “Here is how I will change my statement... Will and I BOTH can do WHATEVER we want, because we TRUST each other to do so. This does NOT mean we have an open relationship... this means we have a GROWN one.”

2015: Will addresses divorce rumours

Will addresses persistent separation rumours by clarifying the pair were not getting a divorce.

“Under normal circumstances, I don’t usually respond to foolishness. But, so many people have extended [to] me their ‘deepest condolences’ that I figured - ‘What the hell… I can be foolish, too!’” he wrote on Facebook at the time. “So, in the interest of redundant, repetitious, over and over-again-ness… Jada and I are… NOT GETTING A DIVORCE!!!!!!!!!!!!!”

2018: Will revealed that he and Jada don’t refer to themselves as married

In an episode of TIDAL’s Rap Radar podcast, Will said he and Jada “refer to ourselves as life partners, where you get into that space where you realise you are literally with somebody for the rest of your life. There’s no deal breakers. There’s nothing she could do - ever. Nothing that would break our relationship. She has my support till death and it feels so good to get to that space.”

2020: August Alsina claims he had an affair with Jada

August Alsina and Jada were introduced in 2015, but it wasn’t until 2020 that he claimed that he and Jada had dated while she was married and that her and Will’s marriage was open during that time.

Alsina said Will gave him and Jada his “blessing”, adding: “I actually sat down with Will and had a conversation due to the transformation from their marriage to life partnership that they’ve spoken on several times and it not involving romanticism.”

Alsina added he “totally gave myself to that relationship for years of my life and I truly and really, really deeply loved and have a ton of love for her.”

The same day Alsina’s claims surfaced Jada’s reps said they were “absolutely not true”.

Less than two weeks later, Jada and Will appeared on an episode of Jada’s Red Table Talk where Jada confirmed that she did have a relationship with Alsina, saying that she and Will were separated at the time.

“We decided that we were going to separate for a period of time and you go figure out how to make yourself happy and I’ll figure out how to make myself happy,” Jada said at the time.

“From there, as time went on, I got into a different kind of entanglement with August... Yes, it was a relationship absolutely.”

Jada also said that Will didn’t give permission, as the only person who could give her permission was herself.

2021: Jada discusses her and Will’s sex life, Will’s memoir is released

In another episode of Red Table Talk in October 2021, Jada said it “takes work” to maintain a spark in the bedroom.

“It’s hard... the thing Will and I talk about a lot is the journey. We started in this [relationship] at a very young age, 22 years old... I think you expect your partner to know - especially when it comes to sex. It’s like: ‘Well, if you love me, you should know. If you love me, you should read my mind.’ That’s a huge pitfall,” she said at the time.

The next month, Will’s memoir is released which details several issues the couple have had over the years. He wrote they were “suffering the brutal death of our romantic fantasies, the burning away of the idealistic illusion of the perfect marriage and the perfect family. Neither of us wanted a divorce; we knew we loved each other, and some aspects of our union were magical. But the structure of the life that we had established was strangling both of us.”

2022: No infidelity statement and Oscars incident

During an interview on CBS Sunday Morning earlier this month, Will said he and Jada had never accused each other of cheating.

He said: “Never. There’s never been infidelity in our marriage...And we have never surprised one another with anything ever..I have decided that chatter about my life can be of a benefit to people. I think that chatter is the first stage to having a real conversation and being able to truly explore if some of the things in your heart are loving, or poisonous.”

In March 2022, Will slapped Chris Rock at the 94th annual Oscars before he yelled at the comedian to “keep my wife’s name out your f***ing mouth”. It quickly became the most talked-about moment of the evening with the pair initially appearing to laugh off the tense moment.

The altercation came after Rock said: “Jada, I love you. GI Jane 2, can’t wait to see you,” referring to Jada’s shaved head. While accepting the award for Best Actor, Will became teary as said he was a “fierce defender of his family”.",A timeline of Will Smith and Jada Pinkett Smith’s relationship amid separation,https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/love-sex/will-smith-jada-pinkett-relationship-timeline-divorce-b2427925.html,The Independent - Life and Style

Although the country star humbly admitted he doesn’t have the ""key"" to a successful marriage, he sure knows the way to his wife’s heart after celebrating over two decades together.

To make their marriage work, McGraw confessed he made a certain promise to Hill at the start of their relationship.

""We just made a commitment early on, when we first decided we were getting married and having kids, that we wouldn’t just walk out the door when problems arose,"" he explained.

McGraw and Hill, both 56, met in 1994 but didn't start dating until 1996. They got married later that year. The couple share three daughters: Gracie, 26; Maggie, 25; and Audrey, 21.

""You know, there’s a lot to be said about that. So we’re not in each other’s face all the time. He’s not in the business, so we have different interests, but yet we have the things we love to do together. So it was meant to be, I think. He was the one I was supposed to have and vice versa.""

""We both have a warped sense of humor. And I think humor, honestly, is one of the best things when you’re married like that.

entertainment,Dilvin Yasa,2023-11-25T18:00:00+00:00,"While it was lovely to be taken care of, we all tend to regress when we’re living with our parents. It’s impossible not to feel infantilised, and there’s a real tipping point where you start to lean into learnt helplessness. I stayed for four months before I moved out to house-sit a friend’s place. Then I launched myself into dating to try to find a man to have a family with. After the roller-coaster of dating, I decided to start fertility treatment on my own, and by the time it began, I’d found a stable job and was renting an apartment. When I got pregnant, I was elated but also terrified about how I would raise a kid on my own, financially and emotionally. Luckily, after I gave birth, my parents invited me to live with them, so I moved back for the first three months of my son’s life. While it was wonderful to have the emotional and practical support, after three months I felt that If I didn’t get out there to live as an independent person, I would quickly lose any sense of what I was capable of. But I’m incredibly grateful for the time I had living with my parents; I know it’s a huge privilege to have them as a safety net. I ended up writing a memoir, Inconceivable, about my journey to become a solo mum – and the complexities of being a woman in your late 30s who has to start over and move back in with your parents. I think while we’re all embracing this contemporary feminist movement where women can create families of their own making, we’re also realising that we need help, that parenthood can’t happen alone.”

“We sold our home to go travelling and now we can’t get back into the market” Yearning for a tree change, Tess Moone, a 31-year-old travel writer, sold her Perth home only to discover that a suitable rental was almost impossible to find. “Our initial ‘quick stay’ with Dane’s parents has stretched out month after month.” “My husband Dane and I became home owners at the age of 21. We thought we were doing all the right things; we bought a house 10 minutes from Perth’s CBD, where I was working. But after the pandemic we began questioning our lifestyle choices. Did we really want to kill ourselves to pay a million-dollar mortgage in the city when we were leaning towards a tree change in Margaret River? So we sold our home in February and spent six months travelling around Europe and Japan. Our plan, once we returned to Perth, was to stay at Dane’s parents’ house while we looked for a rental in Margaret River. We figured we’d be with my in-laws for three to four weeks, but we didn’t realise how bad the rental crisis in the region is. We’ve been offering more than the asking price and/or offering more rent upfront to secure a place, but as there’s a preference to rent to families or those who’ve rented before, we keep getting knocked back. Our initial “quick stay” with Dane’s parents has stretched out month after month. We’re living in one of their spare rooms and have our boxes stored in another.

I love my parents-in-law, so there have certainly been upsides. We’re spending a lot of quality time together and they’re really lovely about trying to give us as much space as possible, often booking weekends away so that Dane and I get the house to ourselves for a couple of days. We’ve also worked out our perfect system for sharing the load; they’ll cook dinner for half the week, for example, and we’ll cook the other half, so the division of labour has been a positive experience. Loading The most challenging aspects? They’re retired, so they’re home a lot. And I work from home, so it’s a little tougher for me than it is for Dane, who works in an office. I get lots of invitations from my mother-in-law to join her and her friends for lunch or coffee when I’m supposed to be working, which is probably not the worst thing to complain about. Despite our love for his parents, the anxiety Dane and I have been feeling has increased as time’s gone by. So much so that we’ve just agreed to move into a friend’s holiday home, sight unseen, even though we’ll have to move back in with Dane’s parents during the times the friend wants to use it, such as at Christmas. It isn’t ideal, but it’s one step back towards independence. If we’d known then what we know now, we’d never have sold our home.” “It’s a shame we don’t value multi-generational living more than we do”

Job insecurity and financial practicality encouraged Rachel Claire, a 32-year-old photographer, to move back in with her parents in 2019. “The great thing about living with your parents when you’re an adult yourself is that you don’t take any of it for granted.” “My parents and I have always been close. When I first moved out of home at the age of 22, my parents would always find reasons to pop by, whether it was just a quick visit after work or to fix things or mow my lawn. I could say they struggled with becoming empty-nesters, but I think it’s more accurate to say we’ve just always enjoyed each other’s company. With my career as a photographer, I was in and out of the country a lot, spending money on rent when I wasn’t often at home – crazy when you’re in an industry where there’s very little job security. Eventually, my parents said that maybe it was a good idea to move back home for a while so I could come and go with minimal financial impact while I was establishing myself. I wasn’t so sure initially; I loved my freedom and struggled with the idea of falling back into traditional parent/child roles in my late 20s. But when I started thinking about the benefits – particularly my parents’ home security systems, which are very handy when you’ve got expensive gear – I accepted and moved back in.","At 37, Alexandra found herself broke, heartbroken and living with her parents",https://www.theage.com.au/lifestyle/life-and-relationships/at-37-alexandra-found-herself-broke-heartbroken-and-living-with-her-parents-20231109-p5eirq.html?ref=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_source=rss_lifestyle,The Age

Fans have spotted Travis Kelce wearing a friendship bracelet with Taylor Swift lyrics on it, just days before she attended his Kansas City Chiefs game.

In a video posted to TikTok on 25 September, a fan shared a photo of Kelce posing with the piece of jewellery on his wrist. The post came after Swift was seen enthusiastically cheering him on in the box seats at Arrowhead Stadium, fuelling speculation that she and the athlete are dating.

The now-viral photo shows how Kelce may have hinted at the ongoing dating rumours before Swift attended his game. The snap showed Kelce posing at the Kelce Car Jam charity event on Friday 22 September, where he was sporting a beaded friendship bracelet that read: “Vigilante S***”

The beads on the friendship bracelet appeared to reference Swift’s song “Vigilante S***” from her 2022 album, Midnights. In addition to the Swiftie-themed jewellery, Kelce also wore a white striped shirt with silver chain necklaces, black sunglasses, and black pants for the event.

In the comments, fans both praised and questioned Kelce for the beaded friendship bracelet. Many people also pointed out how fans of the “Bad Blood” singer famously trade and wear friendship bracelets at Swift’s Eras Tour concerts.

“OF ALL 230 SONGS IN THE DISCOGRAPHY I’M SICK,” one fan commented, while another person wrote: “It’s unbelievable how invested I am in this.”

“I’m gonna need to go back and see all photos of him from the last three months and dissect if he’s wearing friendship bracelets,” a third wrote.

In other photos from the charity event - which were shared to Instagram by Jordan’s KC photography - Kelce wasn’t seen wearing the friendship bracelet, leading many people to believe that he received the bracelet from a fan that day.

Two days after his charity event, the “All Too Well” singer was spotted cheering for the Kansas City Chiefs tight end from the box seats at Arrowhead Stadium in Kansas City, Missouri. Not only was she seen sitting next to Kelce’s mother, Donna, but she also appeared to yell “let’s f***ing go” in response to Kelce’s third-quarter touchdown reception.

After the game, which saw the Chiefs beat the Chicago Bears 41-10, Kelce was seen leaving the stadium in a blue and white splatter-paint denim suit. Eagle-eyed fans were quick to believe that Kelce’s outfit paid homage to Swift’s forthcoming album, 1989 (Taylor’s Version), which is due for re-release on 27 October.

After the two escaped the crowd at Arrowhead Stadium in Kelce’s convertible, according to photos and videos posted online, the football star reportedly rented out Prime Social Rooftop in Kansas City for a post-game celebration with his family, his teammates, and Swift.

“Travis bought out the restaurant for his family and team. Taylor arrived, wearing a denim dress, and was seen snacking, having some cocktails and dancing alongside Travis,” the witness told Entertainment Tonight. “The two were very affectionate with one another but kept things fun and lighthearted. Travis’ teammates also showed up to the after-party, as well as his mom, Donna Kelce. The party lasted until 2 am.”

The late-night outing came days after the NFL star officially addressed ongoing dating rumours about him and the “Anti-Hero” singer. During an episode of The Pat McAfee Show on 21 September, he mocked his brother Jason Kelce for joking that he “100 per cent” believed his younger sibling was dating Swift.

“It’s hilarious how much traction this has actually gotten, right now it’s like a game of telephone,” Kelce said. “Where everybody’s whispering in each other’s ears and hearing random stuff. No one actually knows what’s going on, especially when you got Jason Kelce on live television telling people just both sides - he doesn’t know, it’s true, this and that.”

He also noted that he was still open to pursuing a relationship with Swift, revealing that he subtly asked if she’d want to attend one of his football games.

“I threw it out there, I threw the ball in her court,” he said. “I told her, you know, I’ve seen you rock the stage in Arrowhead [Stadium], you might have to come see me rock the stage in Arrowhead and see which one’s a little more lit. So, we’ll see what happens in the near future.”

Back in July, Kelce first confessed that he tried - and failed - to give Swift his number by giving her a friendship bracelet at one of her Eras Tour concerts. “I was disappointed that she doesn’t talk before or after her shows, because she has to save her voice for the 44 songs that she sings,” he explained to his brother on their podcast.

“So I was a little butthurt I didn’t get to hand her one of the bracelets I made for her,” Kelce said. “If you’re up on Taylor Swift concerts, there are friendship bracelets and I received a bunch of them being there, but I wanted to give Taylor Swift one with my number on it.”",Fans spot Travis Kelce wearing Taylor Swift-themed friendship bracelet before she attended his game,https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/travis-kelce-taylor-swift-friendship-bracelet-b2419065.html,The Independent - Life and Style

Longtime Hollywood couple Will Smith and Jada Pinkett Smith sent shockwaves around the world this week when the Red Table Talk host revealed that she and the actor have been separated since 2016. Both Jada and Will have previously doubled down on their stance against getting a divorce, but her recent reveal about their lengthy separation poses a new question: When should couples just get a divorce?

In an interview with People on 10 October, Jada shared that during the 2022 Academy Awards - when Will slapped Chris Rock after he cracked a joke about Jada’s appearance - the pair had actually been separated for six years. “We’ve been doing some really heavy-duty work together,” she explained, while promoting her new memoir, Worthy. “We just got deep love for each other and we are going to figure out what that looks like for us.”

She praised her and Will’s two children - Jaden, 25, and Willow, 22 - for being her “little gurus” throughout this time, noting that they’ve taught her “a deep sense of self-acceptance”. Although the married couple are not living together, she insisted that their marriage has never been an open one, as she and Will have “eliminated the chance of betrayal” while going on to live their “separate lives”.

This isn’t the first time that Jada and Will have taken some time apart from each other. During a 2020 episode of her Facebook Watch series, Red Table Talk, Jada disclosed that while she and Will were separated amicably, she had a relationship with singer August Alsina, describing their involvement as an “entanglement”.

Throughout their marriage of 26 years, the A-listers have made it clear that divorce was never in the cards. Jada furthered that belief during a preview for an interview with Today’s Hoda Kotb, which aired on 13 October. “I made a promise that there will never be a reason for us to get a divorce,” she said. “We will work through, whatever. I just haven’t been able to break that promise.”

Of course, outsiders aren’t fully aware of the “heavy-duty work” that Jada and Will have done throughout their marriage. But the amount of time they’ve spent separated begs questions about all long-term relationships in general. When is it the time for couples to throw the towel in? And when should separations ultimately become the end result that couples have tried to avoid: divorce.

While there’s never a simple answer to the question, relationship experts have discovered the signs that it’s time to keep fighting for the one you love, or time to let them go.

Speaking to The Independent, New York City-based relationship expert Susan Winter highlighted the jarring differences between a separation and divorce. When it comes to divorce, Hollywood couples can notably get involved in lengthy legal processes, from dividing financial assets to creating child custody agreements. Although we don’t know the terms of Jada and Will’s separation, Winter believes that they’re showcasing a non-conventional relationship that’s not familiar to the public. Will and Jada’s dynamic includes living in separate homes, but it could be a choice that’s for the better.

“It’s an LAT partnership, meaning ‘living apart together,’” Winter said. “While everybody is at a different point as to why they are doing this, the centre point is the same: the preservation of the partnership is paramount. Separations can also be beneficial if both individuals are working on themselves and have the mutual goal of reuniting, or making their relationship better. However, that doesn’t necessarily mean that their improved relationship will result in them living together again.”

On the other hand, dating coach Jacob Lucas - who’s based in the UK - acknowledged that not all separations end in resolutions. When couples opt not to live together anymore, it could create an emotional disconnect between them. If a lack of connection occurred before couples separated, that separation doesn’t necessarily make the issues go away. In fact, Lucas believes that in these situations, couples could also be avoiding the inevitable breakup for the sake of comfortability.

“They’re not resolving their problems, they’re rescheduling them. So, if you separate from someone, but you live in a separate house and you’re still together, it seems to me you’re just not letting go of the past because you want to stick to what’s familiar,” he claimed. “People stick to what they know, and it’s like you have a tether to that person. Your brain’s like: ‘I cannot let go of them because I am scared of the unknown.’ I don’t think I’ve ever seen a couple separate and come back again.”

It’s unclear whether Jada and Will plan on ending their separation and living in the same home again. However, the couple have been candid about their plans to not get a divorce. Jada previously recalled that when she first decided to get married to Will in 1997, it would be for the long haul. “I told Will from the gate, I said let me tell you something: ‘If you marry me, know this: we’re gonna be together. We’re going to be under the same roof,’” she said during a 2018 episode of Red Table Talk. “For me personally, I’m not mature enough to have a divorce, I’m just not. I don’t think I would ever be mature enough, I don’t.”

Will - who divorced his first wife, Sheree Zampino, in 1994 - has also shared similar sentiments about making his marriage with Jada work. Back in 2006, the Fresh Prince of Bel-Air star first explained to MTV News that divorce wasn’t an option for him and his second wife. “With Jada, I stood up in front of God and said: ‘Til death do us part,’” he said at the time. “So there are two possible outcomes. One, we are going to be together ‘til death, or two, I am dead.”

Speaking to The Independent, Lucas noted that while it’s important for both parties to be invested in their relationships, promising not to get a divorce could spark feelings of resentment down the line. Fans aren’t fully aware of why Will and Jada made that promise to each other, but the dating coach believes that an agreement like theirs could create a false narrative about a divorce.

“Getting divorced shouldn’t feel like a taboo because people grow apart and that’s fine,” he explained. “People get stuck in relationships because of their friends and family or societal pressure, and they worry about getting divorced. They think a divorce has a stigma to its name, which it doesn’t, and they push aside the fact that they still essentially feel trapped with someone they don’t want to be with.”

Perhaps one of the reasons why Jada and Will have promised not to get a divorce is because they also agreed not to sign a prenuptial agreement. In an interview with Parade published on 13 October, Jada explained it was her special connection with Will that encouraged them not to sign a prenup before getting married.

“I feel that was a very real moment for the two of us to look each other in the eyes, recognise that there would be tough times in this journey and to say to each other: ‘No matter what, we’re going to figure it out and that’s why we don’t need a prenup, because I’m making a promise that divorce won’t be necessary, that we will figure this out,’” she recalled. “And we made that promise to each other without all of the bridal wedding beauty; it was just sitting on a log in his mother’s backyard, and going: ‘Hey’ - having to really look at the possibility of us not being together.”

Although they’ve made their dedication to each other quite clear, there have been some grey areas over the last seven years about the terms of Will and Jada’s separation. In 2020, Jada made headlines when she revealed in a Red Table Talk episode with her husband that she had a relationship with Alsina. She explained that she and her husband were “separated amicably” when the romance occurred, which had not been disclosed to the press at the time. “We decided that we were going to separate for a period of time and you go figure out how to make yourself happy and I’ll figure out how to make myself happy,” Jada said. As the Girls Trip star recalled that she “got into a different kind of entanglement with August,” she was prompted by Will to confirm it “was a relationship, absolutely.”

Outsiders are now aware that Jada and Will have been separated since 2016, but the timeline of her relationship with Alsina is still fuzzy. Indeed, the terms of Will and Jada’s separation are still unknown to the public and in some cases, having separate relationships can give couples the clarity they need about their marriage.

“What’s pivotal here is, what was the agreement? Did we agree to separate to work on ourselves for the purpose of coming back together again?” Winter said. “Did we agree to separate and just be alone for a while and not have that discussion? And in the second case, if you have an affair, sometimes it can bring you back to the original person. You can get whatever you need to achieve or gain a different perspective, allowing you to decide if you want to come back or leave for good.”

According to Lucas, some of the controversy surrounding Will and Jada’s relationship ties back to the 2022 Academy Awards - when the King Richard star jumped onto the stage and struck Rock across the face after the comedian made a joke about Jada’s shaved head, which is a result of her alopecia. “Keep my wife’s name out of your f***ing mouth,” Will yelled. Now that it’s been revealed the couple was separated at the time, Lucas questioned Will’s behaviour and word choice during the awards ceremony.

“That’s a weird reaction to have somebody who you’ve been broken up with for six years, you know? So, were they really broken up or is Jada saying that as an attention-seeking thing?” he asked.

However, Winter still believes the controversial incident speaks different volumes about the work Will has put into his relationship. “I feel as though Will has a tremendous love and commitment to Jada, as well as to the marriage and the family unit,” she said. “The pride that he takes in defending his wife is extraordinary, almost to the detriment of his image, at times.”

Ultimately, the public will never fully know what “heavy-duty work” Will and Jada are doing in their relationship, and according to Winter, it’s not necessarily any of our business. Still, she believes that their choice to separate is something fluid and outside of the traditional marriage design - an evolving model that could also come to serve other couples. If Will and Jada have been spending seven years apart as a married couple, why would they decide to go back to living in the same household?

“They’re in the rough with a machete, carving a new path for themselves,” Winter said. “Why would they say: ‘Hey, let’s go back to the house and just relax?’ They’re really exploring something vastly different. It doesn’t end up that you go back into that little box of ‘this is a marriage, we’re living together’. It just doesn’t do that.”

Every relationship is different, living in the public eye or not. Although living separately may not be an issue for some couples, there can still be some major signs that it’s time to leave a relationship behind. “When there is no stone left unturned, or when they have tried every single combination possible to make the relationship function and yet it doesn’t, that’s the time to pull the plug,” Winter added. “They’ve done their individual work and they have done the work together and ended up in the same place.”

Will and Jada’s relationship could end in a variety of ways. The celebrity couple could stay separated, move back in together as a married pair, or they can get a divorce. However, there are still certain behaviours in a marriage that could signal it’s time to get a divorce.

“If you feel disrespected by your partner, feel humiliated, or were cheated on, you probably feel ready to split,” Lucas said. “I also think a real big one is, if you lose sexual attraction for your partner and you’ve actively tried to get it back and can’t, it’s time to go.”",Jada Pinkett Smith and Will Smith have been separated since 2016 - when should couples just get divorced?,https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/will-smith-jada-separation-divorce-b2429576.html,The Independent - Life and Style
entertainment,Nell Geraets,2023-09-26T05:26:05+00:00,"The first link between Swift and Kelce was established in 2016, when Kelce – who helped bring his team to Super Bowl victory in both 2020 and 2023 – played the classic game “Kiss, Marry, Kill”. Speaking with AfterBuzz TV, Kelce was given the options of Swift, Katy Perry and Ariana Grande. He said he’d ultimately kill Grande, marry Perry and kiss Swift. That was about six years ago, but it has more recently set tongues wagging as fans wondered how long the plan for them to meet has been in the works. Cruel Summer Fast-forward seven years, and things started to heat up. In July, speaking on the podcast he shares with his brother, New Heights, Kelce said he intended to give Swift a friendship bracelet with his number on it during her Eras Tour concert in Kansas City. Unfortunately, the bracelet never made it to her wrist or his digits to her phone.

“I was disappointed that she doesn’t talk before or after her shows because she has to save her voice for the 44 songs she sings,” he said. “She doesn’t meet anybody, or at least she didn’t want to meet me, so I took it personal[sic].” At this point, it seems like any attraction between the two was one-sided. Kelce’s attempts to make proper contact with Swift at the show ultimately failed. Was she just not that into him? But Kelce, exhibiting the tenacity typical of a professional sportsman, remained determined to get her attention. Wildest Beards The Kelce brothers couldn’t stop talking about Swift, even though she’d left Travis hanging at the concert. Swift’s name began popping up everywhere on the podcast, including during conversations about... facial hair?

In August, the brothers discussed Kelce’s moustache, which he grows every year in honour of the Chief’s head coach, Andy Reid. When asked if he knew what Swift thought of the ’stache, he remained cheekily confident. “We’re not going to bring up Taylor Swift in this episode,” he says, “But something tells me she’s going to like it.” There was a clear suggestion Kelce had made contact with Swift, and was even going to meet her. Shortly after that remark, Kelce took a week off training to visit New York City, according to Vulture. Coincidentally, this happened to be while Swift was re-recording her 1989 tracks in the city. Welcome to New York

The suspicion the two were actually spending time together in New York was seemingly confirmed in September when it was reported they had been “quietly hanging out” for months. This was the first, albeit tentative, confirmation from the media rather than from amateur Swiftie sleuths on social media. So, it was only a matter of time before it entered the cultural zeitgeist. Blank Space Which it did, very quickly. On September 17, Kelce scored a touchdown against the Jaguars, triggering CBS announcer Ian Eagle to reference Swift’s 2014 hit, Blank Space.

“Kelce finds a blank space for the score,” Eagle said, poking fun at Kelce’s newfound Swiftie status. And Eagle wasn’t the only one, with NFL Network’s Rich Eisen including a slew of lyric references during a preshow, including “shake it off”, “anti-hero” and “all too well”. Kelce even acknowledged the tongue-in-cheek banter, commenting on a montage video of the preshow that Eisen posted to Instagram. “Well played Rich … Well played,” he wrote. Suddenly, football fans and Swifties were living through this surprising collision. Swift lyrics were infiltrating NFL game commentary, and her fans were furiously becoming football experts. All that needed to happen was for Swift herself to infiltrate a game, determining once and for all whether there was anything to these rumours or not. This Is Me Trying

On September 21, Kelce announced on The Pat McAfee Show he had invited Swift to watch one of his games. “I told her, ‘I’ve seen you rock the stage in Arrowhead, you might have to come see me rock a stage at Arrowhead and we can see which one’s a little more lit,’” he said. “We’ll see what happens in the near future.” Were they finally about to hard-launch their friendship/potential romance to the world, laying all speculation to rest? Love Story This finally brings us to the fated sighting of Swift at Arrowhead Stadium on Monday, cheering on No. 87 with gusto.

The 12-time Grammy winner appeared to shout “let’s f—ing go” after Kelce scored a touchdown before chest-bumping other Chiefs fans. Considering Swift is known for being an Eagles fan – she’s originally from Pennsylvania and even references the team in Gold Rush – her outward support for the Kelce’s team seemed extra telling. Swifties were immediately on high alert, with some capturing Swift and Kelce leaving the stadium together. If that wasn’t enough, extra observant fans were able to note that Kelce’s blue and white post-game outfit was supposedly labelled the “1989 bedroom painting set”, perhaps an intentional reference to Swift’s 2014 album, which she will be re-releasing in October. Swift’s penchant for Easter eggs must be rubbing off on the tight end player. As if this weren’t enough subtle references already, they were also spotted in a “getaway car” together outside the stadium – potentially a nod towards her 2017 track. Could they have been driving off into the sunset? Of course, none of this actually confirms Swift and Kelce are actually dating. But regardless of whether it’s a friendship or a romantic relationship, it has sent shockwaves through two massive cultural franchises, expanding the NFL’s audience into uncharted territory. It’s a cultural pairing on par with – and perhaps even bigger than – Kim Kardashian and Kanye West.",When pop culture and sport collide: A timeline of Taylor Swift’s NFL takeover,https://www.theage.com.au/culture/music/when-pop-culture-and-sport-collide-a-timeline-of-taylor-swift-s-nfl-takeover-20230926-p5e7lu.html?ref=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_source=rss_culture,The Age

Travis Kelce has hilariously confessed that he attempted to delete some of his tweets before they went viral.

The 34-year-old football star spoke candidly about his previous posts on X - formerly known as Twitter - during an episode of his New Heights podcast with brother Jason Kelce, which aired on 22 November. The comments came after some of Kelce’s funny tweets from 2010 and 2011 resurfaced amid his rumoured relationship with Taylor Swift.

When Jason quipped that everyone is “a big fan of college Travis on Twitter”, the Kansas City Chiefs star acknowledged that his posts weren’t really noticed back then. However, Kelce explained that he was trying to remove his tweets from social media even before they went viral.

“What’s hilarious is that nobody followed me back then,” he said. “But I will say I have been trying to get all those tweets deleted. Like since I got into the league, I’m like: ‘Gosh, I just want all those things to get deleted.’”

He poked fun at how his tweets are now being mocked, adding: “And sure enough, it came surface-level and everybody f***ing dove in, in 2011. What a f***ing year that was.”

The Philadelphia Eagles star continued to discuss the viral responses to his brother’s tweets. He even referenced how Jimmy Fallon and his band performed a song, titled “The Ballad of Travis Kelce”, on The Tonight Show - in which the late-night host recited Kelce’s old tweets. The two brothers highlighted the now fan-favourite post, which reads: “I just gave a squirle a piece of bread and it straight smashed all of it!!!! I had no idea they ate bread like that!! Haha #crazy.”

Kelce later revealed the meanings behind some of his viral tweets, noting that he would simply share the remarks for fun. “I was just using Twitter like a diary. I’m just out here saying nonsense - ‘I just gave a squirrel a piece of bread’ - and spelled squirrel like a jacka**,” Kelce said.

Jason mocked his brother for his spelling of “squirrel” in the tweet, before claiming that’s the reason why the post went viral in the first place. “I’m only spelling squirrel like that from now on, I don’t know why it’s spelled the other way,” he joked. “This one gets crushed, but I think the only reason it’s getting crushed is because of the spelling. Outside of that, if I’m throwing bread around and a squirrel is eating it I’d be pretty pumped up.”

Earlier this month, fans of the A-list couple took to X to share screenshots of some of Kelce’s old tweets - including one post from 2010 that reads: “#Chipotle will always be a great choice!!!!”

The NFL player’s tweets have unsurprisingly resurfaced amid his relationship with Swift, who he’s been romantically linked to since the summer. The dating speculation first began in July, when Kelce confessed that he tried and failed to give Swift a friendship bracelet with his number on it during her Eras Tour show. On his podcast, he later invited the “Anti-Hero” singer to one of his games at Arrowhead Stadium - an invitation she famously accepted on 24 September. Since then, Swift has attended three more of Kelce’s games.

Kelce showed his support for Swift when he attended her Eras Tour show in Buenos Aires, Argentina, on 11 November. During the concert, Swift gave a shout-out to the Chiefs player when she changed her “Karma” lyrics to reflect their relationship. “Karma is the guy on the Chiefs, coming straight home to me,” she sang, letting out a laugh as fans in the audience screamed in response. The “All Too Well” singer was later seen running into his arms and kissing the NFL player following the concert, as he whisked her away backstage.

In an interview withWSJ Magazine published on 20 November, Kelce described how much he admires Swift’s skills as a musician. “I’ve never been a man of words. Being around her, seeing how smart Taylor is, has been f***ing mind-blowing. I’m learning every day,” he explained.

Although he acknowledged the public attention his personal life has received because he’s “never dated anyone with that kind of aura around them,” Kelce specified that he’s not letting the media affect his relationship.

“But at the same time, I’m not running away from any of it,” he said. “The scrutiny she gets, how much she has a magnifying glass on her, every single day, paparazzi outside her house, outside every restaurant she goes to, after every flight she gets off, and she’s just living, enjoying life.

“When she acts like that I better not be the one acting all strange.”",Travis Kelce says he tried to delete his ‘nonsense’ tweets before they went viral,https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/taylor-swift-travis-kelce-tweets-b2453410.html,The Independent - Life and Style

Taylor Swift has officially been named Time’s 2023 Person of the Year.

On Wednesday 6 December, the magazine announced Swift had earned the honour after an “editors’ assessment of the individual who most shaped the headlines over the previous 12 months, for better or for worse”.

The recognition of Swift comes on the heels of a whirlwind year for the popstar, whose Eras Tour dominated ticket sales in 2023. “This is the proudest and happiest I’ve ever felt, and the most creatively fulfilled and free I’ve ever been,” Swift told Time. “Ultimately, we can convolute it all we want, or try to overcomplicate it, but there’s only one question... Are you not entertained?”

Swift was chosen among a strong list of contenders, including Chinese President Xi Jinping, King Charles III, the live-action Barbie movie, and Vladimir Putin. “While her popularity has grown across the decades, this is the year that Swift, 33, achieved a kind of nuclear fusion: shooting art and commerce together to release an energy of historic force,” the magazine said about its selection.

This year alone, Swift has broken records with her career-spanning Eras Tour, which is estimated to have grossed over $1.4bn. Her concert film, the Eras Tour movie, has surpassed $250m at the global box office since its opening weekend in October. Not to mention her rumoured relationship with Kansas City Chiefs tight end Travis Kelce caused a 400 per cent spike in NFL jersey sales.

Since her first NFL appearance in September, Swift’s occasional attendance at Kelce’s games has received pushback from NFL fans who believe her presence is distracting from the game itself. “I’m just there to support Travis,” Swift admitted. “I have no awareness of if I’m being shown too much and pissing off a few dads, Brads, and Chads.”

She playfully added: “Football is awesome, it turns out. I’ve been missing out my whole life.”

The “Bad Blood” singer revealed that their romance began when Kelce gave her shoutout on his podcast, admitting he attempted to give Swift his phone number after one of her Eras Tour shows. The pair immediately began “hanging out” and by the time she attended her first Chiefs game in September, they were already a couple. “I think some people think that they saw our first date at that game? We would never be psychotic enough to hard launch a first date,” Swift joked.

Back in April, it was revealed that Swift and British actor Joe Alwyn had broken up after six years of dating. The former couple were notoriously private, as the Conversations with Friends star previously expressed he didn’t want to discuss their relationship because it “feeds into a weird part of the culture”.

Now, Swift has shared that she has nothing to hide in her new relationship with Kelce. “When you say a relationship is public, that means I’m going to see him do what he loves, we’re showing up for each other, other people are there and we don’t care,” she said. “The opposite of that is you have to go to an extreme amount of effort to make sure no one knows that you’re seeing someone. And we’re just proud of each other.”

Speaking to Time, Swift detailed exactly how much work went into preparing for her Eras Tour - where each concert spans over 180 minutes, with more than 40 songs from at least nine albums and 16 costume changes. “Every day I would run on the treadmill, singing the entire set list out loud,” she told the outlet. “Fast for fast songs, and a jog or a fast walk for slow songs.”

She also stopped drinking and underwent three months of dance training, something that she admitted is “not my strong suit”. After she plays a run of shows, Swift said she takes a day to rest and recover before taking the stage once again. “I do not leave my bed except to get food and take it back to my bed and eat it there,” she revealed. “It’s a dream scenario.”

Most recently, a heat wave in Brazil forced Swift to postpone the second night of her Eras Tour shows in Rio de Janeiro. The decision came after one of the singer’s fans, 23-year-old Ana Clara Benevides, died from a cardiac arrest during Swift’s first performance in the country. Swift explained to Time that “part of my identity as a human” is putting on a show for her fans, no matter the circumstances. “I know I’m going on that stage whether I’m sick, injured, heartbroken, uncomfortable, or stressed,” she said. “That’s part of my identity as a human being now. If someone buys a ticket to my show, I’m going to play it unless we have some sort of force majeure.”

Perhaps it was her decision to re-record her music catalogue that catapulted Swift into such success. When music mogul Scooter Braun aquired Swift’s longtime label, Big Machine Records, in 2019, he also gained the rights to the master recordings of Swift’s first six studio albums. In November 2020, Braun sold the masters to an investment fund in a deal that was believed to be over $300 million. Since then, Swift has released four “Taylor’s Version” albums: Fearless (Taylor’s Version) in April 2021, Red (Taylor’s Version) in November 2021, Speak Now (Taylor’s Version) in July 2023, and 1989 (Taylor’s Version) in October 2023.

“It’s not lost on me that the two great catalysts for this happening were two horrendous things that happened to me,” Swift said, when asked about the success of her tour. “The first was getting cancelled within an inch of my life and sanity. The second was having my life’s work taken away from me by someone who hates me.”

While Swift is arguably more famous now than ever before, the Grammy winner revealed that the constant attention and swarms of paparazzi won’t stop her from living her life. There’s also constant rumours surrounding her personal life, specifically rumours about her relationship with Alwyn that her publicist, Tree Paine, was forced to publicly deny.

“Over the years, I’ve learned I don’t have the time or bandwidth to get pressed about things that don’t matter,” Swift told Time. “Yes, if I go out to dinner, there’s going to be a whole chaotic situation outside the restaurant. But I still want to go to dinner with my friends.

“Life is short. Have adventures. Me locking myself away in my house for a lot of years - I’ll never get that time back,” she added. “I’m more trusting now than I was six years ago.”",Taylor Swift is Time’s Person of the Year,https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/taylor-swift-time-person-of-the-year-b2459419.html,The Independent - Life and Style

In her forthcoming memoir, The Woman in Me, Britney Spears is expected to reflect on some of the most pivotal moments in her life, including her relationships.

Over the years, the pop star’s love life has continued to make headlines. Most recently, her ex-husband Sam Asghari filed for divorce after only 14 months of marriage. Spears is also the mother of two children – Sean, 18, and Jayden, 17 – who she shares with her second ex-husband, Kevin Federline.

According to a press release for The Woman in Me, Spears’ memoir is “a brave and astonishingly moving story about freedom, fame, motherhood, survival, faith, and hope”. Spears’ book is also expected to cover the high-profile legal battle to end her conservatorship, which was dissolved in November 2021 after 13 years.

Throughout her time in the spotlight, specifically during the ‘90s and 2000s, Spears has been in some heavily publicised romances. Unsurprisingly, fans are anticipating that Spears will detail some of her relationships in The Woman in Me, which is set for release on 24 October.

From Justin Timberlake to her now ex-husband Sam Asghari, here’s everything we know about Britney Spears’ relationships and rumoured romances.

Justin Timberlake: 1998 to 2002

Spears’ first highly public relationship was with her co-star in the Mickey Mouse Club, Justin Timberlake. The pair made many appearances together while dating, including the iconic moment Spears and Timberlake wore matching, all-denim outfits to the American Music Awards in 2001.

They broke up in 2002, shortly after Timberlake and his boy band NSYNC released their hit tune, “Cry Me a River”. At the time, the music video for the song – which featured a woman with blonde hair - sparked rumours that he and Spears broke up because she allegedly cheated on him.

Although the former couple never acknowledged the breakup rumours, the 2021 Framing Britney documentary addressed some of the public scrutiny that Spears faced during the 2000s. Following the documentary’s release, Timberlake came under criticism for the way he acted following his breakup with Spears.

He later issued an apology to Spears on Instagram, writing: “I’ve seen the messages, tags, comments, and concerns and I want to respond. I am deeply sorry for the times in my life where my actions contributed to the problem, where I spoke out of turn, or did not speak up for what was right. I understand that I fell short in these moments and in many others and benefited from a system that condones misogyny and racism.”

In June 2021, he also shared his support for Spears after she testified publicly in a bid to end her conservatorship, which was controlled by her father, Jamie Spears. In a Los Angeles court hearing at the time, Spears alleged that she had been forced to take lithium against her will. She also claimed that the team managing her conservatorship had prevented her from having another baby by refusing to remove her IUD.

“After what we saw today, we should all be supporting Britney at this time. Regardless of our past, good and bad, and no matter how long ago it was,” Timberlake wrote on X, formerly known as Twitter. “What’s happening to her is just not right. No woman should ever be restricted from making decisions about her own body.”

Wade Robson: 2001 to 2002

Shortly after her breakup from Timberlake, Spears was rumoured to be dating Wade Robson, a dancer and choreographer who appeared in the music video for her 2009 tune, “(You Drive Me) Crazy”. However, neither Spears nor Robson confirmed these rumours.

Colin Farrell: 2003

Back in 2003, Farrell and Spears made headlines when they were spotted holding hands at the premiere of The Recruit, sparking speculation that they were dating. However, during an interview with Entertainment Tonight at the time, the actor specified that he and the singer were just friends.

“She’s just a mate,” Farrell told the outlet, as reported by People in 2003. “Seriously, we just met a week ago, [we’re] having a laugh.”

Jason Alexander: 2004

Jason Alexander was Spears’ first husband, tying the knot at a wedding chapel in Las Vegas in 2004. However, only 55 hours after the nuptials, they annulled the marriage.

In 2022, Alexander made headlines when he tried to attend Spears’ wedding to Asghari, as could be heard saying in a video that he was going to crash the nuptials. “She’s my first wife, my only wife,” Alexander reportedly told security. “I’m her first husband, I’m here to crash the wedding.”

After he was arrested for trespassing, vandalism, and battery, a security guard later revealed in court that when Alexander crashed the wedding, he also tried to enter Spears’ bedroom.

Kevin Federline: 2004 to 2007

Kevin Federline and the “Gimme More” singer first met at a club in 2004, before they went on to start their relationship. After just three months of dating, the two tied the knot in September of that year during a surprise wedding ceremony. Weeks before their one-year wedding anniversary, they welcomed their first child, son Sean Preston.

In 2006, they welcomed their second son, Jayden James. At the time, Federline was already a father to his daughter Kori Madison, now 20, and son Kaleb Michael, 18, with ex-fiancée Shar Jackson.

Spears went on to file for divorce from Federline in November 2006, citing “irreconcilable differences” as the reason for their split. In the couple’s initial divorce settlement, they were granted joint legal and physical custody over their two children. While it appeared they were on good terms after their separation, things took a turn in 2018 when Federline requested an increase of $20,000 a month more child support payments from Spears.

After months of court discussions, Federline rejected Spears’s child support proposal and instead doubled his request to $40k a month. A settlement was finally reached between the two parties in September 2018, with Spears increasing her child support payments to Federline from $20,000 to $35,000 a month.

Federline has since moved on from the relationship, as he married volleyball player Victoria Prince in 2013. They now share two daughters, Jordan, 10, and Peyton, eight.

Adnan Ghalib: 2007 to 2008

Spears met British paparazzo Adnan Ghalib in 2007, shortly after she decided to shave her hair off in front of approximately 70 photographers. They only dated for about a year, as the relationship ended in 2008.

In the 2021 Netflix documentary, Britney vs Spears, Ghalib spoke candidly about the romance, claiming: “It was a very simple, very easy relationship, you know? But between her fans and everybody else, it was like I was the bad guy.”

The former couple split in 2008 after Ghalib reportedly pulled a pregnancy test-buying stunt for publicity. In 2009, Jamie Spears filed a restraining order against Ghalib, which ordered the photographer to stay away from the singer and her family until 2012.

Jason Trawick: 2009 to 2013

Spears and Jason Trawick, a Hollywood agent who worked at WME, started dating in 2009 before getting engaged in December 2011. However, they called off their engagement in January 2013 and announced they were going their separate ways.

""Jason and I have decided to call off our engagement. I’ll always adore him and we will remain great friends,"" Spears said in a statement sent by her representative to ABC News.

Trawick also issued a statement at the time, saying: “As this chapter ends for us a new one begins. I love and cherish her and her boys and we will be close forever.""

David Lucado: 2013 to 2014

Two months after ending her engagement with Trawick, Spears started dating David Lucado, who worked at a legal firm. In August 2014, Spears announced their split, tweeting: “Ahhhh the single life!” At the time, her representative also confirmed to People: “Yes, she’s single.”

The news of the breakup came asTMZ alleged that Lucado had cheated on Spears, with claims that her father had purchased a video of the infidelity incident. The publication later alleged that Lucado denied the cheating allegations, with claims that he was seeing the other woman while he and Spears were broken up.

Despite their seemingly rocky history, Lucado showed his support for his ex in a 2016 interview with theNew York Times about her conservatorship. Speaking to the publication, he said: “If anyone knew the real Britney, they would know that she would rather be remembered for being the great mother she is rather than the artist she is.”

The publication also noted that Lucado denied the infidelity claims from Spears’ father, before he added: “And if anyone could see her interactions with her kids, they would know that there is no need for a conservatorship over Britney’s personal life.”

Charlie Ebersol: 2014 to 2015

Spears and Charlie Ebersol, who is known as the co-founder of Tempus Ex Machina and The Company, started dating in 2014. While their relationship was fairly low profile, Spears previously opened up about why she was drawn to Ebersol in the first place.

“There was something about him that made me feel really peaceful and at ease. And he was really hot, too. Adorably hot,” she told People at the time.

They officially broke up in June 2015 after eight months of dating.

The pair first met in 2016 when Asghari was cast as Spears’ love interest in the music video for her song, “Slumber Party”, from her 2016 album Glory. They made their relationship Instagram official in 2017 and went on to support each other through different milestones - including the 29th annual GLAAD Media Awards, where Spears accepted the Vanguard Award for her work promoting equality and acceptance.

In April 2022, Spears announced she was pregnant with her and Asghari’s first child together, and her third child. However, the following month, she said in a statement posted to Instagram that she had suffered a miscarriage. The couple wrote: “We have lost our miracle baby.”

That June, they held their lavish nuptials at her home in California with a star-studded guest list, which included Selena Gomez, Paris Hilton, Drew Barrymore, and Donatella Versace - who designed Spears’ wedding dress.

In August, months after Asghari shut down speculation about getting a divorce, TMZ claimed that he had confronted Spears about rumours she cheated on him. That same day, the fitness instructor officially filed for divorce, listing the date of separation as 28 July 2023 and citing ""irreconcilable differences"" as the reason for the split.

In a statement posted online, Asghari said: “After six years of love and commitment to each other my wife and I have decided to end our journey together. We will hold onto the love and respect we have for each other and I wish her the best always. S*** happens. Asking for privacy seems ridiculous so I will just ask for everyone including the media to be kind and thoughtful.”

Days before Spears’ memoir release date, Asghari revealed that he had obtained an early copy of the book. In an interview with TMZ on 13 October, he explained that he wasn’t worried about anything being written in the book that could paint him in a negative light.

“I already read it and I’m very proud of her,” he told the outlet. “She put a lot of work into it, and it was very hard. I’m definitely excited, and I’m extremely proud of her. It was a very tough one [to write].”

entertainment,Laura Snapes,2023-10-24T18:37:25+00:00,"She has never really known freedom

As a child, Britney escaped her difficult home life – her alcoholic father often rowing with her mother – into the outdoors, which “gave me a sense of aliveness and danger”, she writes. Performing also makes her feel invincible. But by the age of 16, she is public property – incapable of going outside without being mobbed, and her love of singing and dancing now a lucrative resource.

By the time of her second album, she wants for so little: skinny-dipping with her dancers after playing Rock in Rio in January 2001 is one of her happiest memories. “It was a taste of rebellion and freedom, but I was just having fun and being a 19-year-old,” she writes. After her split from Justin Timberlake, she dreams about quitting pop and opening a shop: “With the gift of hindsight I can see that I hadn’t given myself enough time to heal from the breakup,” she writes – though her requests for a break are not only turned down, but interpreted as a potential sign of sedition to be quashed and interrogated.

In this restrictive environment, small kindnesses take on an outsized significance, like Paris Hilton encouraging her “to have fun for the first time in a long time”, leading to some infamous nights out with the heiress and Lindsay Lohan. Once again, Britney is seen as stepping out of bounds, potentially damaging her earning potential. One night she has her mother babysit her sons; when she returns home tipsy, Lynne Spears screams at her, she writes. “The shame I felt killed my heart. I stood there, reeling, and thought, OK, I guess it’s forbidden for me to party.” As the restrictions get tighter, Britney acts out – and ends up legally denied her freedom for 13 years, under a conservatorship controlled by her father.

Her body felt like public property

From day one, Britney’s body is made fair game. Between the videos for her debut single, Baby, One More Time and Sometimes, the media noted her changing physique and concluded that the 16-year-old must have had breast implants – rather than simply going through puberty. She notices that talkshow hosts ask her about her chest, while her boyfriend Justin Timberlake gets asked serious questions about his music. It’s one of many pressures that ultimately push her to breaking point, and when she writes about shaving her head in a salon in 2007, she frames it as a “fuck you” to the impossible beauty standards she felt forced to live up to: “I’d smiled politely while TV show hosts leered at my breasts, while American parents said I was destroying their children by wearing a crop top.”

That brief moment of freedom doesn’t last long: a year later, she is ambushed into the conservatorship, which also exercises jurisdiction over her body. “No matter how much I dieted and exercised, my father was always telling me I was fat,” she writes. Punishing gym routines leave her feeling “out of my mind”. Her diet is monitored – along with every other detail of her life – while she goes through the motions of her Las Vegas residency. “My body was strong enough to carry two children and agile enough to execute every choreographed move perfectly onstage. And now here I was, having every calorie recorded so people could continue to get rich off my body.”

Here I was, having every calorie recorded so people could continue to get rich off my body

On the other side of the conservatorship, she writes, freedom looks like being able to gain weight without anyone “shouting at me”. It’s eating chocolate again. It’s posting selfies – either nude or clothed – on Instagram. Some people don’t understand the latter, she writes, “but I think if they’d been photographed by other people thousands of times, prodded and posed for other people’s approval, they’d understand that I get a lot of joy from posing the way I feel sexy and taking my own picture, doing whatever I want with it.”

Her ‘virginity’ was a prison

Britney was actively marketed as a virgin, a repulsive, archaic premise that made the 16-year-old’s inevitable sexuality into a kind of timebomb. In fact, she writes happily, she first slept with her older brother’s best friend when she was 14. Yet the fixation on her “purity” took “the focus off me as a musician and a performer”, she writes. “All some reporters could think of to ask me was whether or not my breasts were real (they were, actually) and whether or not my hymen was intact.”

When Timberlake tells the world that she cheated on him, she is all but emblazoned with a scarlet letter. While she knows she is powerless against that narrative (“I don’t think Justin realised the power he had in shaming me. I don’t think he understands to this day”), him telling the world that they had a sexual relationship was liberating. “To be honest with you, I liked that Justin said that,” she writes. “Why did my managers work so hard to claim I was some kind of young-girl virgin even into my 20s? Whose business was it if I’d had sex or not?”

But she still couldn’t escape the cycle that Timberlake set in motion: she describes her 2004 Onyx Hotel tour in the aftermath as “too sexual, for a start. Justin had embarrassed me publicly, so my rebuttal onstage was to kind of go there a little bit, too. But it was absolutely horrible.”

She has an immaculate sense of shade

Britney seems too pure of heart for active malice, but she has an immaculate way with a piercing characterisation. Timberlake’s band, ‘NSync, were big hip-hop heads, she writes, and sometimes “tried too hard to fit in” with Black artists. When Timberlake spots Ginuwine at an event, he “got all excited and said, so loud, ‘Oh yeah fo shiz, fo shiz! Ginuwiiiine! What’s up, homie!’”

Her account of being encouraged to abort their pregnancy at home, lest anyone see them going in and out of hospital, is horrifying. Britney, with no pain relief, is writhing on the floor. Timberlake proves to be the last person you’d call in a crisis. “At some point he thought maybe music would help, so he got his guitar and he lay there with me, strumming it,” she writes. Almost as embarrassing is husband Kevin Federline’s attempt to start a music career. “He really thought he was a rapper now,” she writes, with the bafflement of someone who has never known pretension. “Bless his heart – because he did take it so seriously.”

Motherhood leaves her vulnerable

When Britney gets pregnant with her first son, she initially thinks it might protect her: “I wanted everyone to stay away: stand back! There’s a baby here!” Inevitably, it doesn’t work out that way. The paparazzi become aggressive, particularly once she has her kids in quick succession – becoming pregnant a second time three months after giving birth to her first. She suffers from postnatal depression and feels hopeless about her ability to protect her sons: “I got a little depressed once I was no longer keeping them safe inside my body … I wanted them back inside me so the world couldn’t get at them.”

Every part of normal life had been stripped from me. I had no freedom and yet also no security

She has a keen sense of injustice regarding a perceived contract that she never signed with the public and the press. “They just kept acting like I owed it to them to let the men who kept trying to catch me looking fat take photos of my infant sons.” Her postpartum body and shots of her without makeup were treated as “some kind of a sin – as if gaining weight was something unkind I’d done to them personally, a betrayal. At what point did I promise to stay 17 for the rest of my life?”

What she knows now, she writes, “is that every part of normal life had been stripped from me – going out in public without becoming a headline, making normal mistakes as a new mother of two babies, feeling like I could trust the people around me. I had no freedom and yet also no security. At the time I was also suffering, I now know, from severe postpartum depression.” It left her suicidal. “I’ll admit it, I felt that I couldn’t live if things didn’t get better.”

She knows she is trapped in a state of arrested development

It’s often said that famous people are frozen in time at the age they became famous, but Britney was never allowed to be a real child, nor a real adult. Her 2001 single I’m Not a Girl, Not Yet a Woman may be her most prescient recording; she is painfully conscious of this divide. After her split from Timberlake, she likens herself to Benjamin Button. “Somehow that year, in becoming more vulnerable I started to feel like a child again.”

The situation worsens amid postnatal depression. “It was as if some part of me became the baby,” she writes in an apologetic section about transferring her frustrations on to her interior decorator. “One part of me was a very demanding grown woman yelling about white marble, while another part of me was suddenly very childlike.”

When she is placed under the conservatorship, she not only regresses, but feels dehumanised by the constant scrutiny. “I became a robot. But not just a robot – a sort of child-robot. The conservatorship stripped me of my womanhood, made me into a child.” It’s hard to explain, she says, “how quickly I could vacillate between being a little girl and being a teenager and being a woman, because of the way they had robbed me of my freedom … They wanted me to be wild onstage, the way they told me to be, and to be a robot the rest of the time.”

Music seems to have become an afterthought

Early on, Britney writes, she loved making music. She told the producer Max Martin that she wanted to sound more R&B than straight pop; she listened to Tainted Love the night before recording Baby, One More Time and stayed up late so that she would sound as gravelly and “fried” as Marc Almond. She was a studio perfectionist who would stay in the booth for hours, and the school setting and uniforms of the Baby video were her idea. “That’s probably the moment in my life when I had the most passion for music,” she writes. “I was unknown and I had nothing to lose if I messed up.”

After that, her music barely gets a mention in A Woman Like Me. There’s a nod to her breaking records; the era-defining Toxic is dispensed with in a sentence. The only album that she goes into any kind of detail on is 2007’s cult favourite Blackout, made at the height of her public struggles yet full of potential. The studio was a refuge from the paparazzi hounding her outside; making a messy DIY video for the single Gimme More may be “by far the worst video I’ve ever shot in my life”, but the scrappiness meant “more interesting people started noticing and wanting to work with me”. There’s some later love for 2016’s Glory, and she writes proudly about her 2022 collaboration with Elton John, but says she has no plans to make music at the moment.

Her life under the conservatorship is a horror story

It feels fitting that The Woman in Me is being released a week before Halloween. No matter how much we already know about the 13 years that Britney lived under a conservatorship, her recounting of its imposition, life under it and her inability to escape it is nothing short of a horror story. It is appalling, like something out of a Victorian novel, not the very real experiences of a thirtysomething in the last decade.

When she fears that Federline is going to take away access to her kids, she locks herself in a bathroom with one of her sons. “Before I knew what was happening, a Swat team in black suits burst through the bathroom door as if I’d hurt someone,” she writes, and she is subject to a forced hospital hold. Soon after, her mother invites her to her beach house because “the cops are after you”. When she arrives, so does another Swat team. “I’m a five-foot four-inch pop singer who calls everyone sir and ma’am,” she writes. “They treated me like I was a criminal or predator.”

The conservatorship clamps down on her life, ruled by her father, who she alleges was “an alcoholic, someone who’d declared bankruptcy, who’d failed in business, who’d terrified me as a little girl”. She is medicated and surveilled. Her dates are required to agree to background checks and blood tests, made to sign NDAs, and receive a full rundown of her sexual history before the first date. “The insanity of this system kept me from finding basic companionship, having a fun night out or making new friends – let alone falling in love,” Britney writes. “It was just the worst thing that could possibly ever happen to my music, my career and my sanity.”

She accedes in order to retain access to her boys, but questions how she can perform at such a high level when she is perceived as “so sick that I couldn’t make my own decisions”. She makes futile attempts to escape the arrangement; meanwhile her father sends her to rehab and Alcoholics Anonymous because she has been taking over-the-counter energy supplements. The women at AA inspire her to start trying to take control over her life but she just hits more walls. Her father won’t let her remove her IUD to start a family with her new boyfriend, later husband, Sam Ashgari (they have divorced since Britney completed the memoir). After she objects to a new dance move suggested for her Vegas residency, she is sent to a solitary rehabilitation facility for two months, the most upsetting part of the book.

Was I a bank robber? A wild animal? Why was I treated as though I were about to burn the place down and murder them all?

She is locked up, put on lithium, subject to relentless testing and mandatory therapy, can’t see her kids or dog, can’t bathe or dress in private or shut the door to her room, has set bed and waking times. For blood tests, “the tech drawing my blood would be flanked by the nurse, a security guard and my assistant. Was I a cannibal? Was I a bank robber? Was I a wild animal? Why was I treated as though I were about to burn the place down and murder them all?” She wonders if her family is trying to kill her. Made slow and sclerotic, “I began to feel like I was being ritually tortured,” she writes, feeling estranged from her own body. “If the idea of my being in that place was to heal, that was not the effect.”

She’s not scared of anything after that experience, she writes, “but it doesn’t make me feel strong; it makes me sad. I shouldn’t be this strong.”

A nurse shows Britney the blossoming fan movement that is spreading awareness of its suspicions that all is not right with her conservatorship. Come June 2021, she calls 911 to report her father for conservatorship abuse days before a probate court hearing on the arrangement. “My voice had been used for me and against me so many times that I was afraid nobody would recognise it now if I spoke freely,” she writes. When she is granted her freedom in November 2021, she says she feels shock, relief, elation, sadness and joy.

There is no love lost for her family

Britney writes about how she was always made to feel she was not enough as a kid; her father’s alleged alcoholism, neglect and brutal standards; how her mother always made her feel less-than. She is unsparing about her younger sister, who she characterises as a brat who was spared the pain of Britney’s impoverished childhood because of her success. “My mom and I had to witness the ugliness and the violence without believing that there was anywhere else to go.”

Even once Britney is the biggest pop star in the world, her parents still seem to have an undue say in the running of her career, including making her sit for humiliating TV interviews – why exactly that is remains unanswered. Her father seizes control legally with the imposition of the conservatorship, telling her, chillingly, “I am Britney Spears now,” and her family appear to live off her dime while she lives an extraordinarily restricted life.

When she returns home from the forced stint in a brutal rehab facility, she finds that her parents have thrown away her childhood things, including a binder full of her poetry. “I felt an overwhelming sadness. I thought of the pages I’d written through tears. I never wanted to publish them or anything like that, but they were important to me. And my family had thrown them in the trash, just like they’d thrown me away.” She resolves to start over with a new notebook. “In that moment I made peace with my family,” she writes. “By which I mean that I realised I never wanted to see them again, and I was at peace with that.”

Britney writes that she is working to feel “more compassion than anger” towards them. “It’s not easy.”",‘I was being ritually tortured’: the most shocking moments in Britney Spears’ memoir,https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/oct/24/britney-spears-memoir-most-shocking-woman-in-me,The Guardian

Editor’s Pick

Planet Terror

Director: Robert Rodriguez

Cast: Rose McGowan, Freddy Rodriguez, Michael Biehn

Few images feel more emblematic of the bombastic action and humor of Robert Rodriguez’s oeuvre than the shot of Rose McGowan aiming the grenade launcher of a leg-mounted assault rifle from the back of a motorcycle in Planet Terror. Released alongside Quentin Tarantino’s Death Proof as the theatrical double feature Grindhouse, the film follows the story of a go-go dancer named Cherry Darling (McGowan) and her estranged lover “El Wray” (Freddy Rodriguez), who find themselves among a handful of survivors after a deadly biochemical agent sparks a zombie outbreak. Banding together, the survivors must find a way to escape the town while fighting against the rogue military commander (Bruce Willis) who unleashed the virus in the first place.

Intentionally tongue-in-cheek, Planet Terror’s story and dialogue are the furthest thing from the film’s saving graces. Inspired by the exploitation films of the ’70s, the movie gleefully relishes in its over-the-top throwback aesthetic, with gory action, comically implausible plotlines, and unabashed sexuality. If you’re looking for a peak “turn your brain off and enjoy” sort of movie, Planet Terror is your ticket to ride. —Toussaint Egan

Certified Copy

Director: Abbas Kiarostami

Cast: Juliette Binoche, William Shimell

The late Abbas Kiarostami was one of the most masterful directors of his time, and his masterful romance Certified Copy is available to watch for free at home. Congratulations.

Certified Copy follows two people: a French antique dealer (Juliette Binoche, arresting as always), and a British writer (famed opera baritone William Shimell), who meet in Tuscany while the latter is promoting his new book. The book, titled Certified Copy, puts forth the argument that there is no such thing as a “copy” in art, because even reproductions are original works. The two debate this idea, as the idea of what is “real” gets called into question, even the very nature of their relationship.

A gorgeous film led by two unforgettable performances, Certified Copy is the kind of masterpiece that will linger with you for years to come. You will fall in love, with this film specifically and with film generally: It depicts humanity at our most impenetrably complex in a way that lays bare our fears and hopes, all while being warm, charming, and delightfully funny. It’s one of a kind, but also in conversation with many other films about love and art. After all, every copy is its own original work. —Pete Volk

Hoop Dreams

Director: Steve James

Cast: William Gates, Arthur Agee

The NBA playoffs have just started with a bang, so what better time than now to watch the greatest basketball movie (and one of the greatest American documentaries) ever made?

Hoop Dreams embeds itself with two high school basketball stars who want nothing more than to make it in the NBA. It’s not just a basketball movie, though; director Steve James paints an in-depth portrait of not only his subject’s lives, but of the fallibility of the American dream and who gets left behind. One of the defining movies of our nation, Hoop Dreams is a compelling and moving must-watch for all, not just basketball fans. —PV

Joint Security Area

Director: Park Chan-wook

Cast: Lee Yeong-ae, Lee Byung-hun, Song Kang-ho

Park Chan-wook’s most recent movie, Decision to Leave, was my No. 1 film of 2022, and he’s one of my very favorite filmmakers working today. He’s made many excellent movies over the course of his career, and you can argue it all traces back to Joint Security Area, the breakout hit that helped launch his career.

A tightly wound thriller, JSA stars with the killing of two North Korean soldiers in the DMZ, and a Swiss Army major who has been sent to investigate the killings. As we learn more, JSA starts to become a movie about an unlikely friendship, and the ways that constructs like borders divide us and put is in deadly opposition to each other.

The highest-grossing movie in Korean history at the time, JSA helped launch Park’s career as well as those of stars Lee Young-ae, Lee Byung-hun, and Song Kang-ho. They’re all excellent in the movie, bringing a complicated and intense story to life. —PV

Mandy

Director: Panos Cosmatos

Cast: Nicolas Cage, Andrea Riseborough, Linus Roache

Yearning for more Nicolas Cage-fueled insanity after watching Renfield and The Unbearable Weight of Massive Talent? What am I saying — of course you are!

Panos Cosmatos’ 2018 action horror film Mandy not only features what many considered one of the actor’s best performances of the past decade, it’s also — as revealed in a recent episode of The Late Show With Stephen Colbert — one of Cage’s favorite movies he’s ever worked on.

After watching Mandy, it’s not hard to see why. Praised for its psychedelic brutality, over-the-top performances, and a prog-rock-inspired score courtesy of the late great composer Jóhann Jóhannsson, Mandy follows the story of a lumberjack who embarks on a conquest of revenge to kill the monstrous Gwar-like cult members who murdered his beloved girlfriend (Andrea Riseborough). You wanna see Nicolas Cage drink vodka in his underwear while wailing hysterically in a pink-tiled bathroom? Here ya go. You wanna see Nicolas Cage go head-to-head against a hulking monster named “Fuck Pig,” snort cocaine off a glass table, and get into chainsaw fight? You got it, sport! Mandy is a blast and if you haven’t seen it yet, boy are you missing out. —TE

Shadow

Director: Zhang Yimou

Cast: Deng Chao, Sun Li, Zheng Kai

No one in the world makes more beautiful action movies than Zhang Yimou. His latest, the political comedy Full River Red, is a fun and strange twist-y thriller that trades some of his usual love for soaring action for fast-paced dialogue and a highly complicated narrative. But Zhang is perhaps best known for his work in the wuxia genre, like Hero, House of Flying Daggers, and Shadow — all breathless displays of cinematic excellence.

Much like Full River Red, Shadow is rich on political intrigue. But it doesn’t skimp on the action — that umbrella you see above is made of blades, and there are many outstanding action sequences utilizing the unconventional weapon. While in color, Shadow makes great use of black-and-white imagery in every element, from stark costuming and set design to lighting that brings out the contrast of black and white. It’s also a master class of framing bodies in motion and one of the best action movies of the century. We are all lucky to be able to watch it for free. —Pete Volk

Steamboy

Director: Katsuhiro Otomo

Cast: Anne Suzuki, Manami Konishi, Katsuo Nakamura

Katsuhiro Otomo’s 2004 steampunk action anime doesn’t get nearly as much love as it deserves. Steamboy follows the adventures of James Ray Steam, the wizkid grandson of a genius scientist living an alternate 1860s Britain, who finds himself in the crosshairs of a nefarious robber baron who wants to conqueror the world using the “Steamball,” an invention capable of generating an infinite (and dangerous) amount of energy.

It may not have neon-lit metropolises populated by roving teenage biker gangs and children with terrifying psychic powers like 1988’s Akira, but it certainly doesn’t lack for its own gorgeous Victorian-era visuals, thrilling action sequences, and beautifully realized mechanical animation. If nothing else, Otomo’s film is a marvel of early 21st-century animation, a film situated at the faultlines of traditional hand-drawn cel animation and the anime industry’s gradual embrace of digitally rendered and painted set-pieces and 3D-animated assets.

It’s a gorgeous love letter to pulp action serials, steampunk alternate history stories, and the writings of Jules Verne cast in a similar mold as another 2004 cult classic: Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow. While the film wasn’t quite the second coming of Akira anime fans so eagerly wanted it to be, Steamboy is a more than worthy follow-up to Otomo’s feature debut in its own right and more than enough to tide you over while you wait for an update on Orbital Era, the director’s first anime feature in 20 years, which was announced in 2019. —Toussaint Egan

What Lies Below

Director: Braden Duemmler

Cast: Ema Horvath, Haskiri Velazquez, Trey Tucker

Braden R. Duemmler’s What Lies Below stars Ema Horvath as Libby, a 16-year-old girl who returns home to her mother’s lake house after summer camp to discover that she’s taken on a new boyfriend, John (Trey Tucker). While initially accepting of her mom’s new beau, Libby gradually begins to suspect that something is... off about John that he’s trying to conceal. With no one but her friend Marley (Haskiri Velazquez) to turn to for help, Libby must expose the truth of John’s sinister nature before it’s too late to save her mother... and herself. Filled with mounting tension, creepy ethereal visuals, and a mind-bogglingly bizarre ending, What Lies Below has more appeal to it than what might at first appear on its surface. —TE",9 great movies to watch on Tubi for free right now,https://www.polygon.com/what-to-watch/23686506/best-tubi-movies-free-watch,Polygon

""It means the world for me to be with my mom at the Christmas holiday,"" Diane Bazella, 64, of Minnetonka, Minnesota, told Fox News Digital in a phone interview.

""It’s all about love,"" she added. ""My prayers have been answered, and my heart is full. We both hope we have many more Christmases to spend together.""

COUPLE ADOPTS FLORIDA BABY WHO WAS ABANDONED IN THE WOODS ABOUT AN HOUR AFTER HER BIRTH

Enjoying Christmastime with her oldest child — and only daughter — has been a long time coming for Sherri Geerts, 81, of Sunnyvale, California, Geerts told Fox News Digital.

""It’s a story with a good ending,"" Geerts told Fox News Digital.

For Bazella, it appeared the search for her birth parents would not be an ordinary one — but rather an epic journey with numerous twists and turns.

The process took grit and determination, research and genealogical skills and most of all, a deep-rooted desire to find out where she belonged, Bazella said.

‘Spent a lot of time’

Bazella first found Geerts, her birth mother, in May 2021, and they met in person in 2022.

But it was only recently that she actually found the courage to share the story of her decades-long search, she said.

""I’ve spent a lot of time dealing with the healing part of it,"" Bazella said.

""I think it kind of gives people hope that miracles are still going on, and the world needs to hear that right now. So that’s part of the reason I’ve stepped out and told my story now.""

That was the start of her quest to locate her birth parents, and in the 1980s she did just that.

Bazella spent the next 39 years trying to bond with the woman whose name appeared on her birth certificate as well as those she thought were her biological family.

""I'm thinking I found my birth parents and my half-siblings,"" Bazella said. ""It's like the story was kind of over in 1983.""

PARENTS WELCOME 14-POUND BABY, THE LARGEST ON RECORD SINCE 2010: 'EVERYBODY WAS MAKING BETS'

Adopted at nine months old, Bazella had been raised by kind and loving parents, the Petersons, in Edina, Minnesota.

When she was a child, Bazella learned through her adoptive parents that she was adopted in 1961, nearly one year after being born at Booth Memorial Hospital — now known as the Booth Brown House Youth Shelter — in St. Paul, Minnesota, to 18-year-old parents who were unmarried.

""The Booth Brown House, which now serves as a safe place for youth to turn, began as a safe haven for unwed mothers,"" The Salvation Army Central Territory, which owns the Booth Brown House, states on its website.

""Started in the early 1900s as The Salvation Army Women’s Home and Hospital, the facility moved to its current location – 1471 Como Ave. W. in St. Paul – and became The Salvation Army Booth Memorial Hospital in 1913.""

Fox News Digital reached out to The Salvation Army Central Territory for comment by email.

Bazell said that when she was 23, she looked through public birth records and was able to track down the woman she thought was her birth mother.

The woman welcomed Bazella into her fold. Bazella was able to learn intimate details about her birth, including that she was originally named Kelly Jean.

Bazella said that looking back, however, she never had a strong bond with the woman she thought was her biological mother, according to those birth records she had found.

The woman then died in 2000.

""She was raising younger children,"" Bazella said of the woman she thought was her biological mother. ""She had a lot going on. There just wasn’t that bond.""

Still searching for a connection, Bazella decided in 2017 to see if maybe her birth father had other children.

‘Shocked and confused’

So, Bazella took a home DNA test — a technology that was newer on the market — and the results brought more confusion: She didn't match with any of her known relatives.

""I was shocked and just so confused,"" Bazella said. ""But at the same time, I wasn’t.""

""When I met my mom, I truly felt unconditional love."" — Diane Bazella

Over the next four years, Bazella reached out to people who were listed on her genealogy report, trying to figure out how they could be related, but with no success.

Finally, one woman she contacted, who showed up as a close DNA match, emailed her back.

""She reached out and said, ‘I want to figure this out with you,’"" Bazella said.

It took the two women more than a year to unravel the story.

""We were thinking [that] maybe I had a different birth father … and that maybe it was one of her relatives,"" Bazella said.

""She went and confronted her dad and came back with the name Sherri Nordlie.""

The woman's father admitted to having fathered a baby girl with Sherri Nordlie — now Geerts — in 1960.

That's when Bazella said she had the revelation that her birth certificate — and everything she had thought for the past 40 years, including the identity of her birth mother was — was wrong.

BABY NAMES THAT ARE REPORTEDLY BANNED IN AMERICA: WHAT TO KNOW

""I knew right away I was switched at birth,"" Bazella said.

""There had been a huge mistake, and it was like it all just came together.""

Two baby girls had been born within hours of each other on Sept. 29 at the hospital for unwed mothers.

One of the babies was named Kelly Jean — and the other was named Dawn Marie.

Bazella, it turns out, was Dawn Marie — not Kelly Jean, as she originally thought. And Sherri Nordlie Geerts was her mother.

Bazella emailed Geerts and they started corresponding regularly.

""I lost 39 years … There’s a lot of grieving with that."" — Diane Bazella

""We were slowly getting to know each other through email,"" Bazella said. ""She had a lot on her plate as a caregiver to her husband, so we were slowly establishing our mother-daughter relationship.""

Finally, on Christmas Day 2021, Bazella and Geerts heard each other’s voices over the phone for the first time.

They met in person in July 2022.

Since then, they have been talking on the phone frequently, sometimes for hours at a time.

‘Same sense of humor’

During their conversations, Geerts opened up about having a baby when she was just 18 years old.

""I do remember the day I had to give her up,"" Geerts told Fox News Digital.

""I got to name her and I got to dress her. There was a lady there to take her away, and she was kind of shaky and it scared me because I didn’t want her to pick her up.""

Geerts said she thought about her daughter every single year on her birthday.

Now that the two have met, they've been getting together several times a year, either in California or Minnesota.

And from the first time they met in person, they began discovering things they have in common.

""We both keep things in order,"" Bazella said. ""We have our lists and we like to get things done.""

""I also remember the first time we met — ee were getting ready to go out and she dug in her purse and pulled out all these tubes of lipstick. I said, ‘Oh my God. You've surpassed me.’ We both constantly put on lipstick. It's so funny.""

Bazella continued, ""We both like [garden] gnomes and we’re kind of collecting them now. Our mannerisms are similar. We have the same sense of humor.""

""One of the main dreams is that we stay healthy and I live long enough … so we can make up some of this time."" — Sherri Geerts

Bazella said she has met all four of her siblings — and also has formed a relationship with her birth father, Victor Rebeck, 84.

While she has found a place with her birth parents, Bazella knows she may never solve the mystery of how she was switched at birth.

""I lost 39 years,"" Bazella said. ""There’s a lot of grieving with that.""

Still, Bazella said she believes she's found unconditional love with her mother.

""It's overwhelming for me coming from where I have been,"" she added.

""I always felt like I was kind of in survival mode and alone. I finally feel at peace with everything, which is really nice.""

As for Geerts, she said she hopes to make up for lost time.

entertainment,,2023-10-13T15:00:43+00:00,"The White Company is gearing up for Christmas with a range of new products that can give an extra cosy touch to your home or make affordable gifts to place beneath the tree. From wreaths and garlands that beckon guests through the door, to warming scents that put everyone in the mood for Christmas, you will be ready to welcome friends and family throughout the coming months.

The White Company is known for its carefully crafted products and an attention to detail that make it one of Britain’s most cherished lifestyle brands. Their Christmas collection, available now, is full of festive products that not only make great presents, but can also help place your home at the centre of the celebrations. Here we share some of The White Company’s festive suggestions and pick out a few of our favourite products from their extensive range

Make your home an open house

(The White Company)

Friends make the season much more enjoyable, so be sure to get your home ready so you can welcome them with warmth and friendship. The White Company is full of Christmas decorations that give your house a seasonal lift, including wreaths, garlands and Christmas lights. We love this gorgeous pinecone wreath made from a mixture of faux greenery, pinecones and berries. It will add some rustic charm to your front door or can be used as a decorative element on an interior wall or table.

A winter scent can also set the tone for warmth and friendship and The White Company’s Winter Collection is ideal. The spicy and warming notes of cinnamon, clove and orange are in a available in a choice of candles, diffusers or oils and you’ll also find plenty of affordable gift options among this collection too.

For an alternative seasonal scent, the Nordic Woods Collection will transport you to a wintery forest with fresh, woody notes of birchwood, the rich warmth of amber, and the more soothing scent of eucalyptus.

Give yourself an excuse to celebrate

(The White Company)

Christmas isn’t just about the Big Day, but finding an excuse to celebrate everything, from an impromptu evening of drinks or a family get-together playing games. And as such celebrations are better with tasty treats to hand, The White Company has a range of homeware that makes sure you’re always ready for the occasion whenever food or drink are called for. We love these Ferne Twisted Stem Champagne Coupes with their hand-twisted stems twinkling under the festive lights and the hand-blown glass providing an extra touch of class to whatever sparkling drinks you serve in them.

For handing round the drinks, canapés or snacks to your guests we recommend this Barton Serving Tray. Its warm, silver-tone finish has wintery good looks, setting off whatever you’re serving in style, while the high-quality aluminium, crafted in India, is durable enough to survive parties or energetic family play.

Embrace the magic of Christmas

(The White Company)

From counting down the days with an Advent calendar, to making your own decorations, or simply digging out your favourite festive fashions, the season is full of little moments that make Christmas so unique, so give yourself time to enjoy the wonder of it all.

This Snowy Advent Calendar will appeal to younger members of the family – a charming penguin with 25 numbered pockets that you’ll have fun filling with treats and gifts. Made from super soft velboa faux fur, no-one will be able to resist giving it a cuddle when its pockets are finally empty.

You’ll also find an Advent Calendar that comes packed with daily indulgent treats in its 25 drawers. We’ve had a sneak peak and can reveal it contains candles, shower gels, nail creams and more seasonal scents and wellness goodies – 25 moments of joy!

These days, everyone loves a Christmas jumper, but you can still keep snug with a touch of elegance while dressing for the season. This Sparkle Snowflake Embroidered Jumper is scattered with embroidered snowflakes for a subtler nod to the season, while its comfort fit and a dash of cashmere adds a layer of snugness to its elegant style.

Appreciate the quieter moments

(The White Company)

Just because it’s a season of fun and entertainment, you don’t have to rush through it all. Find time to relax with a long bath, treat yourself to a lie-in on Sunday morning or pour yourself a glass of wine as the log fire crackles in the background.

This Motion Sensor Plug In Electronic Diffuser is a great little gadget that delivers the ideal amount of relaxing scent at the touch of a button. Simply add your favourite scent oil and the motion-activated sensor helps you to control when it’s released, providing a tranquil atmosphere in whatever room you choose to use it.

When you find time to put your feet up, give your toes some extra comfort and warmth with a pair of Cashmere Bed Socks. They come in a range of colours to suit your style and are made from pure GCS-certified yarns to take the chill off your feet. And seeing as everyone loves cosy socks at Christmas, we think they’re also a great choice for gifting.

For even more cosiness we think you should consider this Faux Fur Throw, made from soft and silky recycled fibres, and matching Soft Fur Hot Water Bottle. They give so much cuddle comfort on chilly winter evenings that you won’t mind how long spring takes to come around.

Mix old traditions with new rituals

(The White Company)

We all have traditions that are handed down through generations – things like opening the sloe gin after the last day of work or a ceremonial placing of the star on top of the Christmas tree. This year, why not start a new ritual such as a designated ‘morning in bed’ or an ‘afternoon pyjama party’, to make sure that Christmas is done your way.

The White Company has a range of nightwear that will add a touch of luxury to any lazy days. This Jersey Piped Printed Classic Pyjama Set will keep you comfortable from top to bottom, with its soft jersey-blend fabric inviting you to curl up in bed or on the sofa. Both the collared pyjama shirt and trousers are printed with tiny stars, adding a subtle sparkle to a festive snooze.

For most Christmas rituals, the Christmas tree takes centre stage and The White Company has got this covered too with a spectacular Pre Lit Grand Spruce Christmas Tree. Standing at 7.5ft tall its high quality faux foliage is an impressively natural-looking shade of green and in-built lights have various settings for a choice of lighting effects. It’s also quick and easy to assemble and take down, leaving more time for those fun festive rituals.

Time for the main event…

(The White Company)

It’s the moment we’ve all been waiting for and, let’s be honest, not everything will go to plan. There may be squabbles and you may not have got round to making your own Christmas pudding. But there’s so much more to enjoy and you’ll learn to appreciate that, whatever happens, your Christmas will be wonderful just the way it is.

Of course, it’s kids that make Christmas extra special, and with The Little White Company you’ll find great gifts for the youngest members of the family besides those friends with newborns. We love their Jingles Reindeer Comforter which is made from recycled fibres and has a squidgy red nose and felt antlers for an all-over soft and soothing feel.

The White Company also has plenty of affordable gifts for grown ups that make great stocking fillers or presents for those surprise visitors. We suspect this Scent Stories Hamper will go down well with any recipient, with candles, hand wash, diffusers and more wrapped up in a hand-woven basket. The scents of myrrh, fir tree and Nordic wood will have your lucky recipient breathing in the magic of Christmas through a swirl of seasonal aromas.

Enjoy the in-between days

(The White Company)

We all lose track of time over Christmas, not sure what day it is or questioning if it’s OK to eat mince pies and brandy butter for breakfast. But there’s still plenty of time for fun and relaxation – a visit to see old friends, a quiet walk in the frosty woods and, of course, the fizz and sparkle of new year parties.

To help you get out of the house, even on the coldest mornings, this Down Filled Oversized Puffer Coat will keep you warm and help to make you look and feel great, despite the excesses of Christmas. Made from recycled fibres, and with a detachable hood filled, this down-filled quilted puffer will embrace you in a pillowy cuddle.

When it comes to New Year’s celebrations, you’ll want to make sure your fizz is served in peak condition, ready for those corks to pop. This Champagne Trug is a party essential. Hand-soldered in nickel-plated stainless steel just fill it with ice and it will chill your Champagne to perfection. It also makes a great statement piece, announcing that yours is the place to go back to during the festive period and beyond.

If you’re in the midst of a new relationship this holiday season, you may be faced with the opportunity to introduce your significant other to your family. However, it’s likely you’ve found yourself mulling over an array of reasons why the holidays may not be the right time for such an introduction.

The holiday season is often perceived as the most wonderful time of year, but that’s not necessarily the case for everyone. In a recent poll from the American Psychological Association, 41 per cent of US adults said their stress levels increased from November to January when compared to other months of the year. Nearly 50 per cent of Americans also described their stress level during the season as “moderate”.

Everyone has different concerns leading up to Christmas, Hanukkah, or New Years - from family drama at the dinner table to a small spats with your mother about decorations. With what can be stressful events, it only begs the question: do you really want to bring your partner into the mix? While it’s important to eventually introduce your loved ones to your significant other, relationship experts believe there are some discussions you should have beforehand, especially during the holidays.

Speaking to The Independent, Rachel Zar - a licensed marriage and family therapist at Spark Chicago Therapy - acknowledged that while every family is different, there’s a variety of problems that could arise during the holiday season - mainly because we put too much pressure on having a joyful holiday. “I think anytime that emotions are heightened, with the holidays certainly being one of those times, our expectations are really high,” she said. “We’re expecting it to be this joyful, happy, perfect occasion. So, we sometimes forget that the holidays come with a lot of stress.”

Despite tensions between relatives at the dinner table, that doesn’t mean your relationship shouldn’t be celebrated. Saba Lurie is a licensed marriage and family therapist at Take Root Thereapy in California. She explained to The Independent that while there isn’t a right or wrong time to introduce your partner to your family, the intentions of such an introduction must be clear. Not only should you have already discussed where your relationship is headed, but you should also tell your partner everything they need to know about your family.

“I think you should tell the person why you’re bringing them home for the holidays, so you’re on the same page about the intentions and what’s motivating the decision to include,” she said. “Sometimes it can be helpful for them to know about the dynamics that they’re stepping into and how they can best support you. Frankly, they should be aware if there is tension or if there is stress within your family.”

Communication before the holidays goes both ways, and there are things that your family should know about your significant other too. “If there’s something about your partner that could be surprising to your family, or that’s a notable difference from who someone you’ve brought home before, tell your relatives that,” Zar said. “Let’s set your family and partner up for success.”

Before bringing your significant other home for the holidays, you may want to express to your family how you wish for them to feel included - such as incorporating your partner’s family traditions into your own celebration. However, Zar advised against oversharing information before Christmas. You still want your family and partner to connect in person, rather than hearing about each other through the grapevine.

When it comes to introducing your partner to your family, there’s still some extra planning to be done ahead of time. If you’re travelling this month, you may need to decide on sleeping arrangements - as opposed to residing in your parent’s house - in order to minimise family stress.

“It would be really helpful to have conversations beforehand, so it’s clear what you are agreeing or not agreeing to,” Lurie explained. “For example, if your family isn’t comfortable with you bringing someone home and sleeping in the same bedroom, then you and your partner may stay elsewhere. But those would be conversations that you all need to have together. It really depends on your relationship with your family and with your partner.”

It’s also important to be checking in with your partner while spending time with your family. These check-ins may include some quality time together, so that any family drama that may arise isn’t hurting your relationship.

“I’d recommend pulling your partner aside and saying: ‘How are we doing?’ Like a temperature check,” she added. “Those are points where the two of you can come and remind each other: ‘We are a team in this.’ Or, the two of you could go on a walk and separate from the family, just for a little bit of time to reset within the relationship.”

During the holiday season, your partner may be seeing how you interact with your family for the first time. But that’s not necessarily a bad thing, according to the relationship experts. “I think introducing a significant other to family is a really vulnerable act, and that vulnerability is going to be what allows for greater intimacy,” Lurie said. “When your significant other sees you with your family, they may see another side of you that they may not have had access to before.”

On the other hand, your partner could learn that your relationship with your parents and extended family members is complex. That isn’t necessarily a cause for concern, as long as you inform your significant other about the interworkings of your family dynamics.

“I think that we tend to be our best relational self when we’ve really done the work around understanding all of our past relationships,” Zar explained. “You can tell your partner: ‘I don’t have a close relationship with my brother, and here’s why. Here are the intentional choices that I’ve made around it.’ Or you can say: ‘Here’s my chosen family. These are the people who are important to me.’ Your significant other will see that you’ve been introspective and have takeaways around how you’ve navigated your family’s origin.”

As long as you and your partner have discussed your relationship expectations - both before and during the holidays – introducing them to your family may deepen your relationship and could be a step in the right direction. Or, it could have a simpler meaning - the holidays being an opportunity to bring two important people in your life together and get to know each other.

Regardless of what your relationship with your family is like, deciding how and when to introduce your partner to your loved ones is entirely up to you. “I don’t think there’s ever going to be a perfect time for folks,” Lurie said. “I think it’ll depend on the relationship between the two partners and also on the family dynamics, and what feels more comfortable for all parties. I don’t think there’s going to be a right or wrong time for the introduction.”",Should you introduce your partner to your family during the holidays?

entertainment,Tasha Robinson,2023-10-24T15:00:36+00:00,"The DC Extended Universe, as DC Comics’ movie and TV line was originally called, has gone through some major growing pains since it launched with Zack Snyder’s Man of Steel in 2013. Looking for ways to compete with Marvel Comics’ massively popular Marvel Cinematic Universe, DC has repeatedly switched tracks and tactics on the DCEU, sometimes steering toward a single interconnected universe, then backtracking into a more director-driven plan where movies like Todd Phillips’ Joker could be made without fitting into any specific previous continuity.

In 2023, the Snyderverse is coming to an end, slowly rolling to a halt with movies like Shazam! Fury of the Gods, The Flash, and Blue Beetle, all leading up to the grand finale of Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom. Once the last bits of the DCEU make their way to theaters, it will be time to usher in a new era of DC movies.

Guardians of the Galaxy and Suicide Squad director James Gunn and producer Peter Safran are taking the reins of the newly branded DC Studios, and they’re bringing a long-term plan to DC with them. The new projects on the DC docket are meant to reboot or reshape DC’s best-known heroes, while reaching into some deeper corners of the DC canon for more obscure characters. And it’s wrapping up the DCEU era, replacing it with just “the DCU,” a mainline continuity that will exist alongside other DC film and TV universes. Here’s everything DC is currently planning to put in theaters and on TV screens, in 2023 and well into the future.

[Ed. note: This story only covers Warner Bros.’ DC projects and doesn’t include The CW’s Arrowverse, which is effectively ending in 2023.]

2023

Aquaman and The Lost Kingdom: Dec. 20

Expect online fandom debates to go ballistic again as we get closer to the sequel to James Wan’s joyously goofy 2018 under-the-sea extravaganza, Aquaman. Jason Momoa is back as the titular superhero/sea king, with Nicole Kidman returning as his mother, Atlanna. Ben Affleck is reprising his role as Bruce Wayne/Batman, Patrick Wilson is back as undersea usurper Orm the Ocean Master, Yahya Abdul-Mateen II is back as the villain Black Manta, and Wan is back at the helm. But most of the early noise about Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom has been about the return of Amber Heard as Aquaman’s love interest, Mera — after the long, contentious legal battle between Heard and Johnny Depp, expect the lead-up conversation about this one to be noisy.

2024

Joker: Folie à Deux: Oct. 4

Todd Phillips’ acerbic 2019 drama Joker — effectively a DC-themed riff on Martin Scorsese’s King of Comedy — didn’t necessarily call for a sequel. It ends in a wide-open place that invites viewers to write their own next chapter. But nothing breeds sequels like success, and the first Joker was a billion-dollar hit for DC during a period where it was struggling to find that kind of payday from any of its properties. It feels like DC may have handed Phillips a blank check and a free rein — at least, that seems like the best way to explain why the Joker sequel is reportedly a musical thriller with ​​Joaquin Phoenix reprising his role as Arthur Fleck/the Joker, and Lady Gaga taking on the role of Harley Quinn. Zazie Beetz will be back as Arthur’s neighbor and entirely unwitting love interest, Sophie.

Creature Commandos

James Gunn is listed as the writer for this seven-episode adult animated series, which will also include Suicide Squad head Amanda Waller. This time, she “creates a black ops team out of monstrous prisoners.” The team will include Frankenstein’s monster (here called Eric Frankenstein and voiced by David Harbour), who has a long, complicated DC history of his own. The series is set to star Frank Grillo (Prison Break) as Rick Flag Sr., Maria Bakalova (Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3) as Princess Ilana Rostovic, Indira Varma (Game of Thrones) as the Bride of Frankenstein, and Alan Tudyk (Harley Quinn) as Doctor Phosphorus.

Waller

Gunn’s hilarious, heartfelt Suicide Squad spinoff series Peacemaker was greenlit for a second season in February 2022, but Gunn has now said he’s going to have to put that project on hold for a bit to concentrate on other things — including Waller, the previously untitled Peacemaker spinoff centered on Viola Davis as no-nonsense supervillain resource broker Amanda Waller. The character, introduced to DC’s movie continuity in David Ayer’s little-loved 2016 version of Suicide Squad (though she’s been part of the comics continuity since 1986), is one of the few elements of Ayer’s movie that was held over in Gunn’s 2021 reboot/reshuffle movie, called The Suicide Squad. She also turned up for a quick cameo in Black Adam. Now she’s getting her own show — which “features Team Peacemaker,” so it may feel like a stealth season 2, depending on who from the team winds up on the series.

2025

Superman: Legacy: July 11

The first of the new Gunn/Safran projects to actually get a release date, Superman: Legacy seems expressly designed to break the DCEU mold. Henry Cavill is moving on from the Superman role, and Gunn, who plans to script the film himself, made several pointed references to this film being a break from past visions of Superman: He called the film “the true foundation of [their] creative vision for the DC Universe,” and said he “can’t wait to introduce [their] version of Superman.” The advance description for this one currently just says it’ll feature the character “balancing his Kryptonian heritage with his human upbringing.”

The Batman Part II: Oct. 3

The long, contentious history behind 2022’s The Batman didn’t leave much room for hope: As one of those movies that got bounced from team to team for years, changing shape at every bounce, it looked like a project that was destined to be driven more by market calculation than by a specific vision. But director and co-writer Matt Reeves found an effective take on the Dark Knight that resonated with audiences and landed solidly at the box office, and DC immediately greenlit a sequel, again with Robert Pattinson as the Caped Crusader. No plot details are clear yet, though Pattinson and Reeves have been blue-skying about a lot of things they’d like to do: The Court of Owls storyline, maybe? Mr. Freeze? Calendar Man, for god’s sake?

Undated

The Penguin

HBO Max’s TV spinoff of Matt Reeves’ The Batman is meant to bridge the gap between that movie and Reeves’ sequel, as Penguin (Colin Farrell) solidifies power in the Gotham underworld immediately after the death of Carmine Falcone (John Turturro) in the movie. The eight-episode series, produced by Reeves and overseen by Agents of SHIELD writer-producer Lauren LeFranc, is meant as a lead-in for The Batman Part II, so even though it’s currently undated, expect it before the movie hits.

Arkham Asylum

The actual title for the second of Reeves’ two HBO Max The Batman spinoffs hasn’t been revealed yet, but this one is meant to be a prequel to the movie. Previously planned as a series about the workings of the Gotham police department, the series mutated in the development stage, and Boardwalk Empire creator Terence Winter, originally in charge of the series, departed the project. Reeves has described this series as an origin story for characters seen in Arkham in The Batman, with more of a horror movie or “haunted house” feel. The Staircase’s Antonio Campos is now the showrunner for the series.

A ‘Black Superman’ movie

DC announced in early 2021 that writer Ta-Nehisi Coates would reboot Superman with a movie that would put a Black man in the title role. Details have been thin regarding whether this film would tie into an existing DC comics story — for instance, whether this might be a movie outing for temporary Superman successor Steel or a complete reimagining of the character — but the film was meant to be produced by J.J. Abrams under his Bad Robot imprint. Reportedly the project is still going forward in the wake of Gunn and Safran’s new slate, but no release date has been announced.

Brave and the Bold

Taking its title from a silver age DC Comic, Brave and the Bold will introduce Batman’s biological son Damian to the DCU — he’s the fifth of Batman’s many Robins — with a story inspired by Grant Morrison’s interpretation of the character in the Batman and Son run of the Batman comic. This will be Damian’s first appearance in a live-action film, though the character has appeared in animated form in TV and movies. The continuity of this film will be separate from Matt Reeves’ planned The Batman trilogy; it’s meant to establish the new DCU continuity for Batman and Robin.

The Authority

The WildStorm imprint — founded as an independent company in 1992 and bought up by DC in 1999 — maintained its own superhero universe separate from DC’s, until DC shut it down in preparation for its characters to join the mainline DC Universe in the company’s 2011 reboot. In its day, Wildstorm published independent and creator-owned comics, alongside superhero series like Warren Ellis and Bryan Hitch’s The Authority, about a group of seven heroes with high-concept superpowers, like the Engineer, a woman with nanotech blood, and Jack Hawksmoor, a man who psychically bonds to cities. This will be the first appearance of WildStorm canon in live-action film.

Supergirl: Woman of Tomorrow

Just as Superman: Legacy is meant to present a new view of Superman for the DCU, Woman of Tomorrow is being billed as “a science fiction adventure” that “presents a Supergirl viewers are not used to seeing.” The movie will be based on Tom King’s celebrated Supergirl comics, and will presumably not touch on anything from the six-year run of Supergirl on The CW starring ​​Melissa Benoist.

Swamp Thing

The recent appearance of Man-Thing in Marvel’s black-and-white special Werewolf by Night suggested there can be space for mainstream superhero comics’ occasional forays into EC Comics-style “weird horror” territory. But it’ll be a while before we get to see what that looks like on the DC side. Swamp Thing, a plant-elemental hero who (depending on which comics you’re reading) might or might not be a mutated version of scientist Alec Holland, dates back to 1971, and was successfully rebooted by Watchmen author Alan Moore in 1984. He’s had several previous screen incarnations, including Wes Craven’s 1982 movie Swamp Thing, a three-season USA Network Swamp Thing series starting in 1990, and a little-watched, quietly dropped one-season series in 2019. DC Studios says this movie “will investigate the dark origins of Swamp Thing.”

Booster Gold

DC hasn’t said much about this TV series, which brings the comics’ fan-favorite comic-relief character to the screen for his own adventures. The company’s logline for the show is just “Booster Gold uses basic technology from the future to pretend to be a superhero in present day” — which is pretty much Booster Gold’s traditional comics depiction as well.

Lanterns

The 2011 live-action Green Lantern movie (starring Ryan Reynolds as original Green Lantern Hal Jordan) was such a legendary flop it scuttled DC’s plans at the time for a new interconnected superhero universe, and Reynolds keeps finding new ways to publicly mock the film, especially in his Deadpool movies. This intergalactic-cop TV series will attempt to revive Hal Jordan for the screen, teaming him up with later Green Lantern John Stewart to “uncover a dark mystery.”

Paradise Lost

This series is set in Wonder Woman’s home island of Themyscira, and DC’s press release says it “focuses on the genesis and political intrigue of an island of all women.” Sounds a bit like The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power, in terms of turning a familiar fantasy story into a political origin story. It’s unclear as of yet whether Wonder Woman herself will have a role in the story, and whether the series will connect with Patty Jenkins’ Wonder Woman movies.

Sandman season 2

Netflix announced in November 2022 that its live-action series Sandman, based on Neil Gaiman’s seminal horror-fantasy comic, had been greenlit for a second season. No date has been announced yet, and given the scale of the visual effects involved in the first season, it’s a fair bet that we won’t see the second season until late 2024 or early 2025 at the earliest. Given that the first season covered the arcs of the first two Sandman graphic novels, Preludes and Nocturnes and The Doll’s House (with side stories from the third volume, Dream Country), it’s a fair bet that season 2 will continue with book four, Season of Mists, the heavily foreshadowed confrontation between Morpheus (Tom Sturridge) and Lucifer (Gwendoline Christie).

Dead Boy Detectives

In spite of a series of cancellations and shake-ups at Max, Neil Gaiman confirmed in January 2023 that the streamer’s Sandman comics spinoff Dead Boy Detectives was actively in production. But that February, the news broke that Max had sold the series to Netflix, because it doesn’t fit with James Gunn’s plans for Warner Bros. DC content. The series is based on a pair of ghost boys, Charles Rowland and Edwin Paine, who were introduced in Sandman’s Season of Mists storyline and later got their own 2001 comics miniseries. They also turned up in season 3 of Max’s Doom Patrol series. The initial press release on Dead Boy Detectives said it would have an eight-episode first season, described as “a fresh take on a ghost story that explores loss, grief, and death through the lens of Edwin Payne (George Rexstrew) and Charles Rowland (Jayden Revri), two dead British teenagers, and their very alive friend, Crystal Palace (Kassius Nelson).”

Peacemaker season 2

Alongside everything else in this universe with his name on it, Gunn hasn’t forgotten Peacemaker. According to the director, Christopher Smith will be making his return for season 2, sometime after Gunn wraps production on Superman: Legacy. This likely means that season 2 won’t be coming along until sometime in 2025 or even later, but hey, at least we know it’s out there.",The future of DC movies in 2022 and beyond,https://www.polygon.com/movies/22352001/new-dc-movies-release-schedule,Polygon

Polygon’s What to Watch highlights the best, the funniest, the scariest, and the most exciting in movies, TV, and everything in between. Stop scrolling, start watching!

Making a collaborative list of the year’s best movies usually feels like trying to form a committee to definitively rank apples and oranges. How do you account for personal tastes? For access, when a given movie — er, fruit variety — is only available in certain markets at certain times? For the fact that apples and oranges are just so qualitatively different that they don’t have a lot in common except juiciness and vitamin C content?

Fortunately, 2023 has its own peculiar answer, in the form of the Barbenheimer phenomenon. Beleaguered movie theaters got a boost this year from film fans who made an event out of seeing two radically different movies back-to-back: a slyly satirical movie about a living fashion toy, and a heavy, grim historical drama about the father of the atomic bomb. While Barbie and Oppenheimer do have a clear theme in common, they’re still radically different movies. But the way they collectively dominated the 2023 box office and the cultural discussion is a strong reminder that regardless of tone or topic, a great story, told passionately, stands out. Cinephiles can be drawn to just about any movie in any genre, if it’s well crafted and engaging, no matter what kind of fruit it is.

Here at Polygon, we have pretty eclectic collective tastes: Some of us are hungriest for action, horror, epic fantasy, or challenging science fiction, while some of us prefer complicated drama or dark neo-noir, and others are drawn to musicals, comedy, animated adventures, and other lighter fare.

Our best-of-the-year list reflects that range.

How the Polygon top 50 list works

Every year, the staff’s film fans create individual ballots to reflect their top movies, with an option to rank them numerically or just weight them. We use these ballots to generate a collective list, weighted by strength of opinion to make sure a much-seen mainstream movie doesn’t have too much advantage over a terrific but underseen indie. And then we put it all out there for your enjoyment. The top 10 picks on each our staff’s lists will be listed in the comments.

Any movie released in the US this calendar year is eligible, but since we are publishing this in early December, some December releases are underrepresented. We hope you’ll find a new favorite here on our list of the best movies of 2023.

Top 50

50. Shin Kamen Rider

Director: Hideaki Anno

Cast: Sosuke Ikematsu, Minami Hamabe, Tasuku Emoto

Where to watch: Prime Video, under the title Shin Masked Rider

The best superhero movie of 2023 didn’t come from Marvel or DC. Instead, it came from Hideaki Anno. Shin Kamen Rider might not reach the soaring heights of Shin Godzilla, but it’s an incredibly fun time bolstered by terrific costume designs, inventive action sequences, and a delightfully bizarre tone, all while looking gorgeous throughout. —Pete Volk

49. Missing

Directors: Nicholas D. Johnson, Will Merrick

Cast: Storm Reid, Nia Long, Ken Leung

Where to watch: Netflix, or for digital rental/purchase

If Knives Out has proven anything, it’s that people are hungry for mysteries on the big screen. Missing — the twisty and fun spiritual sequel to 2018’s Searching — is what people don’t know they’ve been looking for. It’s a web of clues, a mess of mystery, all played within the computer screen of June (Storm Reid), who’s left to figure out what happened when her mom (Nia Long) doesn’t return from a vacation with her boyfriend.

The mystery genre deserves more movies that feel big and meaty. And whether it’s splashed across the big screen or just a computer one, Missing manages to bring its A-game. —Zosha Millman

48. Passages

Director: Ira Sachs

Cast: Franz Rogowski, Ben Whishaw, Adèle Exarchopoulos

Where to watch: Mubi, or for digital rental/purchase

Perhaps the platonic ideal of an arthouse film: a messy love triangle, set in Paris, shot through with explicit sex and arresting fashion choices. Sometimes you just want to watch complicated hot people (Adèle Exarchopoulos, Ben Whishaw, and Franz Rogowski in this case) messing with each other’s heads in tops their characters couldn’t possibly afford. There’s nothing wrong with that. —Oli Welsh

47. Fist of the Condor

Director: Ernesto Díaz Espinoza

Cast: Marko Zaror, Eyal Meyer, Gina Aguad

Where to watch: Hi-Yah!, free with a library card on Hoopla, free on Tubi and Plex

Fist of the Condor is a martial arts throwback where Marko Zaror (John Wick: Chapter Four) plays twin brothers at odds with each other over an ancient text. Zaror, who also choreographed the movie’s fight scenes, excels. There are high-flying kicks, rapid displays of martial arts forms, and the drama inherent to great cinematic fights.

The movie is at its best when leaning into the action, but that’s not all it has to offer. Director Ernesto Díaz Espinoza shoots the landscape of Chile in a way that builds the drama of the fights and adds an element of tranquility to the chaos. For fans of martial arts cinema, Fist of the Condor is a must-watch. —PV

46. The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes

Director: Francis Lawrence

Cast: Rachel Zegler, Tom Blyth, Peter Dinklage

Where to watch: Theaters

The Hunger Games series is one of the few where the movies are often just as good as the books. The new prequel movie, which focuses on a young President Snow (played excellently by Tom Blyth), is no exception. With a particular attention to detail and some masterful songs to really color the world, The Ballad of Songbirds & Snakes is a rare meaningful prequel that bolsters the existing narrative. —Petrana Radulovic

45. The Origin of Evil

Director: Sébastien Marnier

Cast: Laure Calamy, Suzanne Clément, Dominique Blanc

Where to watch: Digital rental/purchase

This French thriller is the kind of twisty story that’s hard to sum up in any way without giving something away, but that’s part of the appeal. Sébastien Marnier, director of the shocking 2018 prep school thriller School’s Out, steers The Origin of Evil away from a neo-noir tone, even though the plot is pure noir, right down to the character types. When a woman (Laure Calamy) insinuates herself into a rich family, claiming she’s a lost daughter to the patriarch, Serge (Jacques Weber), viewers will suspect she has more of an agenda than she’s letting on. But Serge and the rest of his caustic family members have agendas too. Unpacking every lie and scheme in this movie takes every minute of its run time, and it’s guaranteed that audience sympathies will shift half a dozen times in the process. As a crime story, it’s a gem; as a character story, it’s even better. —Tasha Robinson

44. They Cloned Tyrone

Director: Juel Taylor

Cast: John Boyega, Teyonah Parris, Jamie Foxx

Where to watch: Netflix

Juel Taylor’s Blaxploitation-inspired romp follows a drug dealer, a pimp, and a prostitute who inadvertently stumble upon a clandestine government facility that has been secretly experimenting on their neighborhood from the shadows. Faced with the horrifying reality of their situation, the trio band together to do the only thing they can — find a way to spread the truth and fight back against their oppressors. They Cloned Tyrone is a wild, weird, and genuinely funny comedy anchored by strong leading performances (especially in the case of Foxx’s charismatic and foul-mouthed turn as Slick Charles). —Toussaint Egan

43. Broker

Director: Hirokazu Kore-eda

Cast: Song Kang-ho, Gang Dong-won, Bae Doona, Lee Ji-eun

Where to watch: Hulu, or for digital rental/purchase

Hirokazu Kore-eda (Shoplifters) returns with another story about people committing crimes just to survive. This time, it’s two men who sell abandoned babies on the adoption black market.

Song Kang-ho and Bae Doona deliver electrifying performances — Song as another shifty, funny schemer who is in way over his head, and Bae as a hard-headed cop pursuing them. But it’s Lee Ji-eun, as a young mother who becomes entangled in the scheme, who steals the show, with a fierce intelligence and hardened worldview concealed by a veneer of youthful innocence. Plus one very adorable baby. That never hurts. —PV

42. Creed III

Director: Michael B. Jordan

Cast: Michael B. Jordan, Tessa Thompson, Jonathan Majors

Where to watch: Prime Video, MGM Plus, or for digital rental/purchase

In 2015’s Creed, Michael B. Jordan established his bona fides as a true movie star when he assumed the role of Adonis Creed, the lost son of Apollo Creed and heir apparent to his father’s title as the heavyweight boxing champion of the world. In this year’s Creed III, Jordan has taken on the mantle of the Rocky franchise and made it his own as both the film’s star and director, enriching Adonis’ story with a perspective and style that feels at once fresh and familiar.

With electrifying fight sequences and powerful lead performances, Creed III is a knockout sports drama that combines anime-inspired choreography with a powerful narrative about strained relationships and redemption. —TE

41. Infinity Pool

Director: Brandon Cronenberg

Cast: Alexander Skarsgård, Mia Goth, Cleopatra Coleman

Where to watch: Hulu, or for digital rental/purchase

Death doesn’t have to be real in the world of Infinity Pool — at least, not if you’re rich enough to turn it into a fun night out. Director Brandon Cronenberg’s (2020’s stellar Possessor) third film gazes into the bizarre void of identity and wonders what happens when it gazes back. Infinity Pool is queasy and fascinating, and perhaps 2023’s most nihilistic view of wealth. But the real selling point are the go-for-broke central performances by Mia Goth and Alexander Skarsgård. —Austen Goslin

40. Master Gardener

Director: Paul Schrader

Cast: Joel Edgerton, Quintessa Swindell, Sigourney Weaver

Where to watch: Hulu, or for digital rental/purchase

The third in Paul Schrader’s thematic “Man in a Room” trilogy, Master Gardener follows a reformed former white supremacist (Joel Edgerton) who works as a horticulturist on a grand Southern estate. When the young Black relative (Quintessa Swindell) of the estate’s owner (Sigourney Weaver) arrives, the two form an unlikely bond.

Master Gardener is a gorgeous movie, filled with fields of flowers and excellent performances from Edgerton and Swindell. The movie distinguishes itself from many other “reformed racist” movies by having Edgerton’s character already distanced from his past self, rather than relying on his relationship with a Black person to spur that change. He’s a new person, but that doesn’t erase his history. It’s a wonderful coda to a superb trilogy. —PV

39. Theater Camp

Directors: Molly Gordon, Nick Lieberman

Cast: Jimmy Tatro, Ben Platt, Molly Gordon, Noah Galvin

Where to watch: Hulu, or for digital rental/purchase

All great camp movies are about found family, and there are few subcultures that theme fits better than theater kids. Theater Camp, from Molly Gordon and Nick Lieberman, is well aware of this and plays its excellent (and specific) jokes to the cheap seats for an audience it knows has felt its characters’ pains and joys themselves.

What Theater Camp understands best about its subjects is that being a theater kid means never really leaving a stage. It’s all performance, whether it’s for an audience, your best friend, your campmates, or alone to yourself. And it doesn’t really matter if you’re laughing or crying, as long as you enjoyed the show. —AG

38. BlackBerry

Director: Matt Johnson

Cast: Jay Baruchel, Glenn Howerton, Matt Johnson

Where to watch: AMC Plus, or for digital rental/purchase

More Social Network than the recent streak of corporation-flavored inventopics (see: Air, Tetris, The Beanie Bubble), genre-bending filmmaker Matt Johnson’s indie take on tech breakthroughs and backstabbing finds darkly comedic laughs in capitalist meltdowns. At the center of the movie: two great performances destined to fly under the radar.

Wannabe businessman Jim Balsillie (Glenn Howerton) initially brushes off lowly inventor Mike Lazaridis (Jay Baruchel), until he sees a gold mine: a reimagined mobile prototype that doesn’t actually work, but could definitely sell. Johnson’s screenplay, co-written with his Dirties and Operative Avalanche cohort Matthew Miller, delivers all the bravado one expects from this type of rise-and-fall saga. Howerton rewires his Always Sunny Dennis persona into a true warhead, barking at Doom-playing brainiacs until they get results. Baruchel’s arc as a tech genius sinking in corporate quicksand is almost a mini Breaking Bad. Johnson’s touch is delivering a searing indictment of Canada’s own Silicon Valley behavior with puncturing goofs and plenty of chewed-up scenery — it’s a fun movie, too. The keyboard clacks and the cast absolutely roars. —Matt Patches

37. Eileen

Director: William Oldroyd

Cast: Thomasin McKenzie, Anne Hathaway, Shea Whigham

Where to watch: Theaters

Sleek and understated, Eileen takes a compact and uncomfortably close eye to a psychological thriller about ladies making bad decisions. Based on the novel by Ottessa Moshfegh — who co-wrote the script with Luke Goebel — Eileen follows its eponymous protagonist (a magnetic and fidgety Thomasin McKenzie) and her obsession with Rebecca (Anne Hathaway), a worldly and glamorous psychiatrist who begins working at the prison Eileen works at as a clerk. As the women get closer, they feed into each other’s darker impulses, and upend their lives, violently. With pulpy thrills and assured direction from William Oldroyd, Eileen is a perfect anti-holiday film in the vein of David Fincher’s The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo, a smart, edgy feel-bad good time. —Joshua Rivera

36. Earth Mama

Director: Savanah Leaf

Cast: Tia Nomore, Erika Alexander, Doechii

Where to watch: Paramount Plus, Showtime, or for digital rental/purchase

Gia, a pregnant single mother in the Bay Area, seeks to recover her two children from foster care. The close-up is director Savanah Leaf’s flex. She uses the shot with a confident abundance that few contemporaries dare. On each character, she moves in close, like a friend at a party with a secret to tell under the loud music. When that intimacy is shared with Gia herself, what differentiates Earth Mama comes into focus. We are not observing this woman from a distance; we are sitting beside her, listening closely and hoping for the best. —Chris Plante

35. The Wonderful Story of Henry Sugar

Director: Wes Anderson

Cast: Benedict Cumberbatch, Ralph Fiennes, Ben Kingsley

Where to watch: Netflix

Benedict Cumberbatch is a rapscallion who seeks to learn how to see without his eyes (in order to cheat at gambling). The premise is mostly immaterial. Henry Sugar, and the three other Roald Dahl stories Wes Anderson adapted for Netflix, are opportunities for the director to continue to push his aesthetic forward.

In his recent work, Anderson has made bare the artifice essential to filmmaking. These shorts take that even further. Actors recite Dahl’s words verbatim, often speaking directly to the camera. The sets are treated like those on a theater stage, collapsing or building in real time to aid scene transitions. Even in short form, Anderson never ceases to amaze. —PV

34. M3GAN

Director: Gerard Johnstone

Cast: Allison Williams, Violet McGraw, Amie Donald

Where to watch: Prime Video, or for digital rental/purchase

2023 was such a big year for big conversations about AI (including AI art, AI writing, and AI style theft) that it’s no surprise we’re already getting a fresh wave of “AI is going to murder us all” horror movies. But M3GAN is a refreshingly goofy spin on that old trope — and a fairly creepy one, too. When a tech whiz (Allison Williams) has to take responsibility for her dead sister’s kid, she distances herself by building a robot to handle parenting for her. It goes badly. Scripted by Akela Cooper with the same shamelessly messy, giddy verve she brought to Malignant, M3GAN is a good time for knowledgable horror fans, packed with referential humor, but still channeling some real anxiety about the place computers have in our lives and how far that’ll eventually go. —TR

33. When Evil Lurks

Director: Demián Rugna

Cast: Ezequiel Rodríguez, Demián Salomón, Luis Ziembrowski

Where to watch: Shudder, AMC Plus, or for digital rental/purchase

Demián Rugna’s gory possession movie isn’t just the usual barrage of religious imagery and religious anxiety: It’s much more concerned with bigger, sadder thoughts on the ways our institutions keep failing us, and the ways we fail each other and ourselves. Ezequiel Rodríguez gives a mesmerizing performance as Argentinian farmer Pablo, a man estranged from his wife and in denial about his own responsibilities. When a demonic presence starts stalking his rural county, he runs to his ex-wife and the city, and brings the curse along with him. It’s a shocking film that crosses lines in unusual ways for a horror film (particularly around horrors visited on children and animals), but what really makes it land is how well realized all the human drama is, more so than the demon drama. —TR

32. Polite Society

Director: Nida Manzoor

Cast: Priya Kansara, Ritu Arya, Nimra Bucha

Where to watch: Prime Video, or for digital rental/purchase

Ria (Priya Kansara) dreams of being a stuntwoman and loves her sister deeply. So when her sis drops out of art school and gets engaged to some jabroni she’s known for a month, Ria does what any of us would: Plan a wedding heist to rescue her sister from what’s surely a fate worse than death.

With that, Polite Society vaults between genres and tones and makes it all look easy, melding the wedding-prep comedy with Ria’s action thrill ride. Ria’s story may be singular, but all of us can relate to the enthusiasm and care she brings to her life. (Even if the rest of us are still trying to nail our flying reverse spinning kick.) —ZM

31. Talk to Me

Directors: Danny Philippou, Michael Philippou

Cast: Sophie Wilde, Joe Bird, Miranda Otto, Alexandra Jensen

Where to watch: Digital rental/purchase

Talk to Me is like the horror movie version of a perfect comedy sketch. It’s got a perfect premise (possession as a party drug), a brilliant turn you saw coming from the start but that hits even better than you expected, and it ends before it wears out its welcome. It helps that it’s also one of the most stylish and shocking horror movies of the year.

Between its abrupt bursts of violence, possession-party montages, and creeping family tension, by the time Talk to Me’s brisk (just under 90 minutes before the credits roll) run time is up, it feels like you were one of the lucky kids who let go of the demon hand at exactly the right moment for the maximum high. —AG

30. Skinamarink

Director: Kyle Edward Ball

Cast: Lucas Paul, Ross Paul, Dali Rose Tetreault

Where to watch: Hulu, AMC Plus, Shudder, or for digital rental/purchase

Skinamarink is hands down the most peculiar and divisive horror film to come out in 2023. It is also one of the best. A pair of siblings awake in the middle of the night to find their home transformed into an inescapable nightmare of yawning hallways, dimly lit corridors, and looming walls devoid of any windows or doors. As they search aimlessly for safety and familiarity in this otherworldly situation, the children find that they are not alone in the house, haunted by an unknowable entity that seems to feed on their fear, as it twists their lives into ever more frightening shapes. Or maybe not! The film’s narrative is notoriously sparse and open to interpretation, but the effect is nonetheless one of the most unsettling scenarios seen this year. —TE

29. Are You There God? It’s Me, Margaret

Director: Kelly Fremon Craig

Cast: Abby Ryder Fortson, Rachel McAdams, Benny Safdie

Where to watch: Starz, or for digital rental/purchase

Judy Blume’s coming-of-age novel is one of the most challenged in the country, because of its direct discussion of puberty. But it’s a staple of children’s literature, and director Kelly Fremon Craig’s movie is a gem. She previously wrote and directed The Edge of Seventeen, so she knows her way around crafting a relatable coming-of-age movie. As Margaret’s parents, Rachel McAdams and Benny Safdie steal scenes, but Abby Ryder Fortson’s earnest and endearing performance as Margaret anchors the whole film. —PR

28. Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem

Director: Jeff Rowe

Cast: Micah Abbey, Shamon Brown Jr., Nicolas Cantu, Brady Noon

Where to watch: Paramount Plus, or for digital rental/purchase

Director Jeff Rowe and executive producer Seth Rogen’s spin on the turtles asserts itself as one of the most visually impressive animated films of the post-Into the Spider-Verse era. A modern reboot of the classic TMNT origin story, Mutant Mayhem emphasizes the fact that everyone’s favorite anthropomorphic reptilian warriors are, well, teenagers, with all the stupid, fun-loving shenanigans that come with being an adolescent. From the character designs and lighting to the action sequences and soundtrack, everything in the film pops with its own unique oddball charm that breathes new life into a beloved franchise. Whether you’re new to the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles or a longtime fan, TMNT: Mutant Mayhem is a certified banger. —TE

27. Dungeons & Dragons: Honor Among Thieves

Directors: Jonathan Goldstein, John Francis Daley

Cast: Chris Pine, Michelle Rodriguez, Justice Smith

Where to watch: Prime Video, Paramount Plus, MGM Plus, or for digital rental/purchase

Far from the definition of great, ambitious filmmaking, Honor Among Thieves is nevertheless a pretty perfect romp for fantasy fans, whether or not they know the RPG or care about its rules. It’s funny, fast-paced, and freewheeling, full of visual gags for the in-the-know crowd, but broad and action-driven enough to be comprehensible to people who’ve never picked up a d20. Chris Pine and Michelle Rodriguez’s companionable bard-and-barbarian relationship is a lovely model for how to include a romance-free mixed-gender friendship in a story — still a frustratingly rare thing for mainstream movies. —TR

26. Napoleon

Director: Ridley Scott

Cast: Joaquin Phoenix, Vanessa Kirby, Tahar Rahim

Where to watch: Theaters

Rather than trying to encompass the entire life of one of modern history’s most important and captivating figures, Ridley Scott’s biopic seeks to establish three things about Napoleon Bonaparte. First, that he was one of the greatest battle commanders, tacticians, and military men to ever live. Second, that he was a petty and weird little pervert. Third, that those first two things are deeply and irrevocably intertwined.

To that end, Napoleon is undeniably hilarious. Sure, it has gigantic battles, with beautiful photography and framing, and a more jaw-dropping sense of scale than almost any movie made in the last decade. But between its massive and awe-inspiring battles, Napoleon finds time to gawk at France’s first emperor parading around his palace, screaming at the English about boats, and pouting about being cucked. It’s the story of Bonaparte by way of Barry Lyndon, and we’re all luckier for it. —AG

Top 25

25. Jawan

Director: Atlee

Cast: Shah Rukh Khan, Nayanthara, Vijay Sethupathi

Where to watch: Netflix

The biggest Indian movie of the year is a genre-bending, crowd-pleasing spectacle that rests on the reliably charismatic talents of star Shah Rukh Khan.

Jawan is many things, but the cleanest description of the premise is “Charlie’s Angels meets Robin Hood.” Another clean description would be “everything you want in a blockbuster movie,” combining some of the year’s best action, romance, and dance numbers within a compelling revenge story with a strong “power to the people” message.

The key to Jawan’s joyful success, though, is Shah Rukh Khan. One of the biggest movie stars in the world, he has returned to blockbuster cinema after a brief hiatus with Pathaan and this movie. Both are very fun and make good use of his irrepressible charisma, but Jawan shines to a different degree. It’s a reminder of what blockbuster movies can be — fun and exciting, but with plenty on its mind. It’s the highest-grossing Indian release of the year and the second-highest-grossing Hindi film ever. As you catch up on the year’s biggest releases, don’t miss this one. —PV

24. Saltburn

Director: Emerald Fennell

Cast: Barry Keoghan, Jacob Elordi, Rosamund Pike

Where to watch: Theaters, coming to Prime Video Dec. 22

Emerald Fennell’s startling, gleefully dark follow-up to Promising Young Woman is another story about toxic obsession. This time, the central figure is a social climber (Barry Keoghan, mesmerizing as ever) trying to weasel his way in among a rich family in 2000s England. It’s one of the year’s most polarizing films: Critics either applauded its daring or dismissed it as empty provocation, due to its graphic use of nudity, sexual imagery, and extreme behavior. But “empty provocation” is such an odd insult to levy at a movie from someone who so thoroughly thinks her movies through. Saltburn is visually luscious and emotionally gripping, a real feast for the senses. It’s grimly funny and full of shocks. And it’s a smarter, more insinuating take on the growing eat-the-rich subgenre. —TR

23. Dream Scenario

Director: Kristoffer Borgli

Cast: Nicolas Cage, Julianne Nicholson, Michael Cera

Where to watch: Theaters

There is nothing special about Paul Matthews (Nicolas Cage). He’s a frumpy college professor in a small, cold town. He has a wife and daughter and students that take his biology class because it’s required. And he has started to appear in the dreams of everyone in the world. Writer-director Kristoffer Borgli’s black comedy about viral fame gives audiences plenty to ponder, with sudden turns both hilarious and deeply uncomfortable. All of it is held together thanks to a tremendous performance from Cage, in his best role since 2021’s stunner Pig. In Cage’s hands, Paul Matthews’ plight, while farcical, stays grounded in humanity, and all the petty, cringeworthy foibles that come with it. —JR

22. The Zone of Interest

Director: Jonathan Glazer

Cast: Christian Friedel, Sandra Hüller, Ralph Herforth

Where to watch: Theaters

The Zone of Interest is set mere feet from the walls of Auschwitz, at the home of commandant Rudolf Höss (Christian Friedel) and his family. The Höss family builds their life in this small estate, with a fancy house, and Mrs. Höss’ (Sandra Hüller) carefully curated garden, while the horrible sounds and black smoke of the concentration camp constantly seep over their protective walls.

Director Jonathan Glazer’s camera never really goes inside the camp, or shows the prisoners huddled there or their actual fates. Rudolf is careful to never speak about his job while at home.

This may sound like it sidelines the tragedy and horror of the Holocaust, centering the story on the culprits rather than the victims, but Glazer’s carefully measured detachment lets the situation speak for itself, as the quiet part gets louder and more horrific throughout the film. This creates a completely different kind of Holocaust film from almost any we’ve ever seen, and one that is essential in understanding the scale and depth of its evils. —AG

21. Priscilla

Director: Sofia Coppola

Cast: Cailee Spaeny, Jacob Elordi, Dagmara Domińczyk

Where to watch: Theaters

I won’t spoil it, but perhaps the best needle drop of the year arrives at the end of this Priscilla Presley biopic: a stone-cold tear-jerker so apt it takes your breath away, and a song with a complex history that adds multiple layers of delicious dramatic irony to the scene. Nobody ever accused Sofia Coppola of lacking taste. Adapted from Priscilla’s memoir about life with Elvis — who groomed her to be his companion from the age of 14 — Priscilla is a dreamy, uneasy, claustrophobic study of life in a gilded cage (a Coppola specialty). Cailee Spaeny and Jacob Elordi are stunning in the lead roles, and Coppola, empathetic as ever, is careful neither to let Elvis off the hook nor damn this damaged man completely. It’s a fascinating companion piece for Baz Luhrmann’s Elvis, a brassier study of the man as performer that only skirts his domestic life, but shows he had a cage of his own to contend with. —OW

20. Anatomy of a Fall

Director: Justine Triet

Cast: Sandra Hüller, Swann Arlaud, Milo Machado-Graner

Where to watch: Theaters

The premise could set up a tacky 1990s courtroom drama or erotic thriller: A woman’s husband falls from a balcony and dies while she was in the house. Did she do it? Anatomy of a Fall is not one of those movies, but it’s not not one of those movies either. Justine Triet’s Palme d’Or-winning procedural is not a thriller, but it is thrilling; and even though Triet stubbornly refuses to pick any of the obvious ways her film could resolve itself, it achieves a deep and lingering payoff anyway. Anatomy of a Fall is a hypnotic well of a movie in which the truth of what happened only seems to recede the deeper you dive into it. That’s a bold, almost sadistic choice, but the sleek presentation, sharp script, and riveting performance by Sandra Hüller — perhaps the year’s best by any actor — keep you on the hook. —OW

19. Knock at the Cabin

Director: M. Night Shyamalan

Cast: Dave Bautista, Jonathan Groff, Ben Aldridge, Rupert Grint

Where to watch: Prime Video, or for digital rental/purchase

This recent stretch of M. Night Shyamalan films has marked a fascinating chapter in the career of one of the most idiosyncratic directors working today. Coming off of the success of 2021’s Old, Knock at the Cabin marks Shyamalan’s return to one of the most understated yet prevailing themes of his work: religious terror and despair in the face of the unexplainable.

The film follows a family (Jonathan Groff, Ben Aldridge, and Kristen Cui) who, after traveling to a secluded cabin in rural Pennsylvania for a vacation trip, find themselves menaced by a group of four heavily armed intruders who refuse to let them leave. The family is presented with a warning and an ultimatum: Every single person on the planet is about to die, and the only way to prevent this catastrophe is for one of them to choose to sacrifice themselves for the sake of humanity. As the family struggles to escape from their captors, the undeniable weight of their situation begins to set in. Could their kidnappers be telling the truth? And if so, would any of them be willing to submit to the unthinkable cruelty of their fate?

Knock at the Cabin is a film that challenges its audience to look inward for the answer to these questions, all the while witnessing its story unfold. This is not a horror movie whose horrors rely on brutality and gore — though there is certainly that and then some — but one whose apocalyptic premise provokes both outright terror and disquieting introspective dread. —TE

18. Mission: Impossible — Dead Reckoning Part One

Director: Christopher McQuarrie

Cast: Tom Cruise, Rebecca Ferguson, Hayley Atwell

Where to watch: Digital rental/purchase

Tom Cruise loves popcorn and movies, and nobody made a better popcorn movie in 2023 than Dead Reckoning Part One. While it fell some way short of the series’ critical and commercial peak, Fallout — mistakes were made, chiefly putting “Part One” in the title — the seventh (seventh!) Mission: Impossible film is another shockingly confident and artful action movie that delivers set-piece after astounding set-piece over a breathless two and a half hours.

At its center, controversially edging Cruise’s slinky pas-de-deux with Rebecca Ferguson out of the frame, is a new, more kinetic and balletic partnership between the star and Hayley Atwell. In the movie’s best sequences (the Rome car chase, the train carriage climax), the pair somehow blend jaw-dropping practical stunt work with ballroom dancing, silent slapstick, and rom-com meet-cute — a perfect, fizzing cocktail of a century of cinematic sugar highs. —OW

17. The Killer

Director: David Fincher

Cast: Michael Fassbender, Tilda Swinton, Sophie Charlotte

Where to watch: Netflix

The Killer, like the assassin at its center, is difficult to pin down. It’s astonishingly gorgeous and well made, but at the same time stubbornly unflashy. It’s bleak and violent, but at the same time hilarious and irreverent. It’s fascinated with exploring the ideas of how media shapes identity, but completely resistant to assigning any actual meaning. The Killer is the kind of movie that can throw in a fight scene for five minutes that’s better than almost any fight in a mainstream movie this year, then never go back to hand-to-hand combat again. In other words, it’s a David Fincher movie through and through.

Fincher is famous for his precision on set and his dedication for finely honing every aspect of his films until they’re exactly what he needs. And yet, his movies never feel stodgy, tight, or lifeless; he makes it look easy. And that’s where The Killer truly excels. It breezes by every assassin movie and thriller trope, executing each one flawlessly, all while making a snide comment about it. It’s the kind of movie that feels so effortless and smooth that it makes you wonder why all movies can’t be this good. But that’s Fincher’s gift; his films have the kind of quality and handmade perfection so precise it can be mistaken for the work of factory machines… until you look a little closer. —AG

16. Ferrari

Director: Michael Mann

Cast: Adam Driver, Penélope Cruz, Shailene Woodley

Where to watch: In theaters Dec. 25

Between Ferrari and Oppenheimer, it’s been a fabulous year for biopics about bastards doing tremendously dangerous things.

The Enzo Ferrari biopic’s standout sequences are unquestionably its races, which director Michael Mann infuses with tension, speed, and horror. The movie goes to great lengths to show us how dangerous auto racing is, and every time someone gets into a car, Mann translates that danger into a palpable tension. But what’s most surprising about Ferrari is that its most thrilling sequences are those that clear the way for Adam Driver’s performance as Enzo.

The movie is an incredible portrait of a man who was a perfect concoction of some of Mann’s favorite things: obsessive, brilliant, awful, detached, and a winner through and through. The film, and Driver’s exceptional performance, make Ferrari’s ambition and passion deeply clear. The painful determination driving him is absolutely electric to watch — even more exciting than the races, which is saying something. —AG

15. Poor Things

Director: Yorgos Lanthimos

Cast: Emma Stone, Mark Ruffalo, Willem Dafoe

Where to watch: Theaters

If there were an award for unlikeliest but most effective Oscar bait, it would go to this reunion of The Favourite star Emma Stone; its Greek surrealist director, Yorgos Lanthimos; and its screenwriter, Tony McNamara. Poor Things is tipped to win a few real Oscars, despite making The Favourite look like a normal movie. It’s a deeply weird, neo-Frankenstinian fable about a reanimated woman’s quest for independence, identity, and the meaning of life. Yep — along with everything else, Poor Things is also goth Barbie.

Adapted from a cult novel by the eccentric Scottish writer, illustrator, and typesetter Alasdair Gray, Poor Things reworks Frankenstein to explore themes of feminism, sex, and social rot. Lanthimos doubles down on the baroque stylings of The Favourite to create an astonishingly visually dense film composed of outlandish costumes, lavish sets, and fantastical painted backgrounds, often shot through woozy fish-eye lenses. It’s also, surprisingly, one of the year’s most hilarious movies, in no small part thanks to Mark Ruffalo’s game campery and McNamara’s cleverly twisted syntax. But the movie is Stone’s. Her performance is fearless, frank, funny, and intensely physical. Bella is no less than a deconstructed human being, and to watch her slowly reassemble herself is to fall in love with the character: an insatiable, ferocious force of nature, whose appetite for life and love for humanity never dim, despite their many disappointments. —OW

14. Suzume

Director: Makoto Shinkai

Cast: Nanoka Hara, Hokuto Matsumura

Where to watch: Crunchyroll

Makoto Shinkai’s career seems to have been building up to Suzume. It has all the hallmarks of Shinkai’s recent, most popular works: a young couple brought together by strange fantastical elements, a looming disaster threatening to upend the world, and clear blue skies. But everything that didn’t quite work in Your Name and Weathering with You manages to coalesce together in Suzume.

While Suzume is about two young people banding together to save the world from disaster, it is equally about Suzume, the protagonist, overcoming her own trauma. As she travels cross-country with an animated chair (who is actually a handsome and mysterious young man), she starts to connect with other people, instead of closing herself off. Her quest to stop a giant earthquake-creating worm comes from the fact that she lost her mother in the 2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami. Slowly but surely, throughout her journey, she rediscovers her will to live and realizes that her life is not disposable. Unlike Shinkai’s other works, the romance is subtle, the barest hint of it actually, and that just makes it resonate even more.

It’s a beautifully haunting story, rooted in a real-world tragedy that makes it resonate even more. —PR

13. Godzilla Minus One

Director: Takashi Yamazaki

Cast: Ryunosuke Kamiki, Minami Hamabe, Yuki Yamada

Where to watch: Theaters

Godzilla fans aren’t wanting for new media, including the recent Apple TV series Monarch. These recent releases, while enjoyable, have taken a distinctly Hollywood approach, building out a mythology in the style of the MCU. Godzilla Minus One is the first Japanese live-action Godzilla film from Toho since the brilliant, post-Fukushima Shin Godzilla. And it returns to the original recipe.

Minus One is a throwback: to the post-WWII Tokyo setting, to 1950s human melodrama, and to a kaiju singularly focused on the obliteration of large, human-made structures. Its hero, Koichi Shikishima, is a kamikaze pilot who, in the final days of the war, fakes a technical issue with his plane, taking shelter in a repair facility on a small island that just so happens to be in the path of a certain teenage lizard monster.

How Shikishima builds relationships with a wide cast of lovable surrounding characters elevates Minus One above other giants. Where Shin Godzilla chronicled a government response to disaster, Minus One pins its hopes on civilians who — failed by their leaders and the world — must rely on each other. —CP

12. John Wick: Chapter 4

Director: Chad Stahelski

Cast: Keanu Reeves, Donnie Yen, Ian McShane

Where to watch: Starz, or for digital rental/purchase

John Wick has only ever wanted to fuck off and retire, and no one seems to get the message. Chad Stahelski’s saga about the boogeyman of assassins in a world full of them reaches a staggering crescendo in Chapter 4, a film that somehow manages to run faster and hit harder than three previous movies dedicated to constant escalation. Facing off against action legends Donnie Yen and Scott Adkins, Keanu Reeves pushes John Wick harder and farther than before in a film that rages against the untouchably wealthy, and their expectation that the world be in their service. —JR

11. May December

Director: Todd Haynes

Cast: Natalie Portman, Julianne Moore, Charles Melton

Where to watch: Netflix

Elizabeth (Natalie Portman) arrives in Savannah to prepare for a new role based on Gracie (Julianne Moore), a grown woman who slept with 13-year-old Joe (Charles Melton) and subsequently married him. Elizabeth comes with an open mind, ready to inhabit Gracie and fully understand her. And yet, across Todd Haynes’ May December, we see how nothing is as simple as Elizabeth — or the audience — thinks. Gracie is always more than meets the eye: more emotional, more aware, more monstrous. And throughout the movie, Haynes expertly teases out the two women’s mysteries as they each try to craft an identity around the other.

Haynes’ film certainly has callbacks to other, classic movies about selfhood. But in a way, May December feels most in line with something like The Rehearsal, which also has a lot on its mind about how blurry the line between real life and performance can be, and particularly how traumatic it is to ask kids to behave like adults. It’s something Melton’s Joe is tragically caught in the middle of, and something May December always has on its mind, even when it feels like it’s about other things. As Gracie and Elizabeth obsess over little details, May December lets Melton make the case for the quiet, seething corruption at the heart of the film. —ZM

10. Showing Up

Director: Kelly Reichardt

Cast: Michelle Williams, Hong Chau, John Magaro

Where to watch: Digital rental/purchase

Lizzy (Michelle Williams) is a 30-something artist living on campus at her hometown art school. She wants two things in life: time to prepare for her exhibition, and her landlord, Jo (Hong Chau), to fix her hot water heater. Superficially, there’s little more to Lizzy’s plight, for the better. Director and co-writer Kelly Reichardt never permits the stakes to rise too high or the plot to get too complicated. Because this film, at its core, is about working artists working in less financially stable mediums, like ceramic figurines and trippy visual projections. Without plot filling the film, we have time to just be present in this beautiful Pacific Northwest scene.

Reichardt’s genius is getting the audience giggling at the artists but never the art. For example, it’s funny to think that an artist dedicated a year of her life to crocheting a jumpsuit. Except then, in Showing Up, you see the outfit and it’s beautiful — an intentional undermining of the punchline. A teacher smugly opines on ceramics, but each piece he holds up is so lovingly crafted that they confidently speak for themselves.

This decision (rib artists, celebrate art) sets the tone. We humans are artifice, a bunch of contradictory masks that we put on to match the situation and the crowd. But our creations — when we commit to a craft, whatever medium it may be — are an expression of our most vulnerable selves.

I suppose I knew this on some subconscious level, but Reichardt, as with so many of her films, helped me mine the epiphany from my brain or heart or wherever I was keeping it. She knows that art, when created from that place of sincere intent, deserves compassion and respect — even if its creator is still a desperate, self-conscious ball of anxiety. And now I know it too. —CP

9. Barbie

Director: Greta Gerwig

Cast: Margot Robbie, Ryan Gosling, Will Ferrell

Where to watch: Digital rental/purchase before streaming on Max

Any description of Barbie’s big themes (toxic masculinity, how Barbie branding affects young girls, women as playthings, the commodification of girl power) makes it sound preachy and stilted. But writer-director Greta Gerwig and co-writer Noah Baumbach never hold still for long enough that viewers will feel like they’re sitting through a Gender Studies 101 class. They package these ideas into a giddy satire full of bright and winning performances, pointed jokes aimed at Mattel and the corporate world, terrific casting (Issa Rae as President Barbie, Simu Liu as one of many Kens, and Kate McKinnon as Weird Barbie are standouts), and endless cultural gags. And then there are the bright, poppy meta-humor musical numbers, including Ryan Gosling turning “I’m Just Ken” into 2023’s top movie anthem.

Perky, playful, and deceptively caustic, Barbie is one of just a few films (like 1995’s The Brady Bunch Movie and 2007’s Enchanted) that gleefully satirize a cultural staple while also treating it with real affection. Margot Robbie makes a perfect Barbie, whether she’s in perky-and-plastic mode or slowly revealing her underlying humanity, as fears of death and dying leak into the endless party of Barbieland. There’s so much going on in this patter-filled, joke-a-second comedy that it feels like 2023’s Everything Everywhere All at Once, right down to the big life messages smuggled into all the goofery. It’s a high-speed joke-fest that doesn’t take Barbie any more seriously than she deserves — but does pay solemn homage to all the ways, positive and negative, that Barbie fandom makes people feel. —TR

8. Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse

Directors: Joaquim Dos Santos, Kemp Powers, Justin K. Thompson

Cast: Shameik Moore, Hailee Steinfeld, Daniel Kaluuya

Where to watch: Netflix, or for digital rental/purchase

2018’s Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse changed the game for superhero movies and animated movies. It raised the bar for what a Spider-Man story could be, and inspired animators to push the boundaries of what their movies could look like. Maybe Hollywood as a whole took away the wrong lesson (we’ve seen so many multiverse movies), but Into the Spider-Verse redefined genre staples.

The sequel continues to raise the bar. It’s a little busier than the first, pulling in more characters, more frantic visuals, more emotional throughlines, but it’s still bold, daring, and unlike anything else in the superhero movie sphere.

As the characters bounce across the multiverse, the animation style shifts, with each character rooted in a different style. Spider-Gwen’s world is rendered with watercolors, which shift according to the tone of her story. She gets a step up in this movie — a second chance for Gwen Stacy, whose previous iterations across media have not ended well. Meanwhile, Spider-Punk, the brash counterculture rebel, is made up of collaged bits, and animated against the norm so he stands out even more. Every frame of the movie is a visual feast, just bursting with lovingly rendered details.

With a bigger cast and higher stakes, Across the Spider-Verse wasn’t going to finish its story in just one movie. It ends on a huge cliffhanger, but all the pieces are in place for one hell of a trilogy finale. —PR

7. The Boy and the Heron

Director: Hayao Miyazaki

Cast: Soma Santoki, Masaki Suda, Ko Shibasaki

Where to watch: Theaters

Texture is essential to Hayao Miyazaki’s work. Sometimes the most visceral memories of his movies are the ways liquids glob or glide, while wood flecks flint and flake in tiny explosions. Famously, even his still shots contain some motion, often featuring the slightest of movements that make the world feel more full — more real.

The Boy and the Heron, for all its fantastical realms and magical happenings, follows the same ethos, constantly grounding itself in the feel of Miyazaki’s style and knack for characters drawn into strange worlds. This time it’s 11-year-old Mahito, who’s bored and miserable after moving to the country following his mother’s death in a World War II bombing. His grief has a touch familiar to those who have lived with it: bland and isolating. But the touch of Miyazaki’s work is always deeper, and it’s not too long before an errant heron proves the veil between Mahito and his more vivid dream world is much thinner than he knew.

But no matter which side of the fantastic we’re on, The Boy and the Heron makes the texture of the world feel enthralling. Little details — a bandage loosening in water or a granny’s gait — weave together, building a world that feels at once like anything Studio Ghibli has made and wholly its own. It manages to meditate on its themes without lingering, never letting its story falter (even as our hero languishes in his country tedium). No one is going to be on the other side of an argument calling Hayao Miyazaki the GOAT (at least, nobody I care to talk to). But The Boy and the Heron shows that he is always game to top himself, finding new ways to add layers to every part of his work. —ZM

6. Asteroid City

Director: Wes Anderson

Cast: Jason Schwartzman, Scarlett Johansson, Tom Hanks, and many more

Where to watch: Peacock, or for digital rental/purchase

To people who don’t know Wes Anderson’s work well, he’s a known quantity that’s easily replicated and parodied: If you’re watching one of his films, you’re going to see a lot of fast-talking people responding with unemotive calm to extraordinary events, against a backdrop of meticulously designed pastel sets. But fans see a lot of nuance within that formula, as Anderson’s voice (especially his sense of humor) develops from film to film.

In Asteroid City, his ridiculously meta story-within-a-story sci-fi film about an alien encounter, that voice hones in on the question of art and creativity — who it’s for, what it brings the artist and the audience, why any form of recognition or acclaim is good enough for one creator while another strains to find connection and resonance in their work. It’s the kind of film that moves so quickly, and with so little attempt to hold the audience’s hands and tell them what to feel, that it takes some work to scratch the surface.

But it’s worth diving into the movie’s connections and themes, as a who’s who of actors — many from Anderson’s usual stable, and some debuting here — bounce off each other, looking for meaning in an isolated desert setting. The cast (including Tom Hanks, Scarlett Johansson, Jason Schwartzman, Jeffrey Wright, Sophia Lillis, Edward Norton, and many, many more) navigate familial death, meaningless plaudits, and that alien visitor with the same straight-faced aplomb. This may not be a movie designed for passionate emotional response, but as usual for Anderson, it’s remarkably specific, idiosyncratic, beautifully assembled, and absolutely intentional. —TR

5. How to Blow Up a Pipeline

Director: Daniel Goldhaber

Cast: Ariela Barer, Lukas Gage, Forrest Goodluck

Where to watch: Hulu, or for digital rental/purchase

An unconventional adaptation of the controversial 2021 nonfiction novel, How to Blow Up a Pipeline applies the ethos of the book (which argued sabotage is a necessary part of environmental activism) to a fictional scenario. In the movie, a group of people from different walks of life — students, disillusioned activists, service workers, punks — gather in Texas with a plan: Blow up an oil pipeline and finally enact some real change. And the movie absolutely rules.

The movie takes the best parts of the heist thriller genre (a likable crew who each brings their own specialized skills, a worthy cause, a focus on the process, a tense finale) and discards the rest (notably, there is no major police/investigator B-plot). It’s a perfect marriage of the genre and the movie’s radical politics, without sacrificing either. Pipeline is also just an impeccably crafted movie, with strong location work that makes the most of America’s vast landscapes, hinting at past beauty ruined by industrialization. And it’s all supported by great performances from emerging stars, especially Forrest Goodluck (The Revenant), who excels as a quiet, awkward, self-taught explosives expert.

One of the buzziest and most controversial movies of the year, don’t mistake it for an empty vehicle for controversy; How to Blow Up a Pipeline is a thoughtful, masterful work that weaves in the principles of what makes heist thrillers fun to great effect. 2023 has had many great movies, but none feel as urgent and timely as this one. —PV

4. Killers of the Flower Moon

Director: Martin Scorsese

Cast: Leonardo DiCaprio, Lily Gladstone, Robert De Niro

Where to watch: Theaters, or for digital rental/purchase

Ernest Burkhart loves money. It’s one of the first things he says when he arrives in Oklahoma, fresh off the Great War’s killing fields and into the arms of his manipulative uncle, William Hale. Together, they will help turn this land, home of the Osage Nation, into another killing field. For 206 minutes, we will watch them.

Killers of the Flower Moon is an act of lamentation. A cinematic wail against one of the many foundational horrors of these United States, a crime that is still in living memory, its ill-gotten gains still propping up any claim to prosperity the nation has today.

With tremendous conviction, director Martin Scorsese’s reverent, methodical film adapts David Grann’s 2017 account of the reign of terror that plagued the Osage in the 1920s, paring back the sprawling story to focus on Burkhart (Leonardo DiCaprio), Hale (Robert De Niro) and Mollie Kyle (Lily Gladstone), the Osage woman who would marry Burkhart and pay for it with the lives of her entire family.

Through the Burkhart marriage, Scorsese renders the crimes committed against the Osage in miniature, three and a half hours of rumination on the theft and bloodshed that watered the prosperity of white America, endured in stifled silence for a century. Monumental and sobering, Killers of the Flower Moon trembles at the evil that has been grafted onto our collective story, and mourns the voices that will never get to be a part of it. —JR

3. The Holdovers

Director: Alexander Payne

Cast: Paul Giamatti, Da’Vine Joy Randolph, Dominic Sessa

Where to watch: Theaters, or digital rental/purchase

If you hate sentimental, cliched “abandoned kid and aging curmudgeon create found family” movies like I hate them, The Holdovers is a guaranteed surprise. The latest from Alexander Payne (Election, Nebraska), scripted by Kitchen Confidential creator and writer David Hemingson, reunites Payne with his Sideways star Paul Giamatti, playing a buoyantly stuffy professor at a ’70s private boys’ prep school, where he’s tasked with overseeing “the holdovers” — the kids who are staying at the school for Christmas while all their more fortunate classmates head home or out on adventurous holidays.

The Holdovers is full of sudden twists, mostly backstory reveals suitable for a particularly startling stage play. But the real surprise is how personal and specific it becomes, and excellent writing and acting help it dodge the expected parameters for this kind of story. Eventually, it settles into a three-hander between Professor Hunham (Giamatti), his troubled adolescent student Angus (Dominic Sessa, in an intense star-making performance), and Mary (Da’Vine Joy Randolph), the school’s head cook, an older Black woman mourning her son’s recent death in the military.

All three of these characters get room to develop and reveal themselves, and they’re all handled with sensitivity and real warmth that goes far beyond the usual sentimental holiday feel-good fare. (If anything, this is a pretty dark story, and not in a laughable Bad Santa kind of way.) It’s a beautifully calibrated, touching drama about starting over when there’s no other choice available. —TR

2. Past Lives

Director: Celine Song

Cast: Greta Lee, Teo Yoo, John Magaro

Where to watch: Available for digital rental/purchase

A radiant romantic drama with a shiver of tension running through it, Past Lives is about a love that might have been. But it’s also about a person who might have been (or two people, or three). As well as romantic relationships, it’s a movie about the complicated relationships people have with themselves: especially the various versions of themselves who exist in the past, the present, the future, and on the paths not taken.

It unfolds in three time frames. In Seoul, around the turn of the millennium, Na Young and Hae Sung are 12-year-old classmates and best friends who might be starting to develop deeper feelings for each other, but Na Young’s family is planning to emigrate to Canada. 12 years later, Na Young has changed her name to Nora Moon (Greta Lee) and is a young writer living in New York; she falls into an intense Skype affair with Hae Sung (Teo Yoo), but plans to visit each other never come together. In another 12 years, Nora is still in New York with her husband, Arthur (John Magaro), and Hae Sung comes to visit, threatening to destabilize all their lives.

It’s a film of almost impossible delicacy. Writer-director Celine Song and her brilliant trio of actors hold so much within Past Lives’ patient frame — unspoken feelings, unrealized possibilities, layers of cultural subtext — that you find yourself holding your breath while watching it, even before it gets to its heart-stopping final scene. The 35mm film cinematography by director of photography Shabier Kirchner (Small Axe) absolutely glows, too. Past Lives has a lot to say about the immigrant experience and about the uncertain spaces between childhood and adulthood. It has a philosophical, maybe even spiritual dimension, too. But this all emerges quite naturally from a simple, beautifully observed, and achingly romantic story that anyone can relate to about the sweet pain of the one that got away. —OW

1. Oppenheimer

Director: Christopher Nolan

Cast: Cillian Murphy, Robert Downey Jr., Florence Pugh

Where to watch: Theaters and for digital rental/purchase before streaming on Peacock

Is there much left to say about the United States’ criminal, moral compromise in dropping the atomic bomb or the obviously tortured psychology of the bomb’s creator, J. Robert Oppenheimer? Maybe not, but as Christopher Nolan proves in his biopic on the life of the theoretical physicist, there’s plenty left to feel. Cross-cutting through time at lighting speed, and smashing together facts in ways its source material, the exhaustive biography American Prometheus, can’t in bound form, Nolan’s action-movie sensibilities split the very atoms of his subject to understand not the what, but the how and why.

Bouncing from the early days of a daydreaming scientist to the congressional hearings of his eventual political confidant to Oppy’s eventual time at Los Alamos, his $2 billion built-from-the-ground-up research base, Nolan litters the drama with factual detail ripped straight from the book. Yet at every turn, he ditches the Bohemian Rhapsody school of explanation to handwave away complicated mathematical explanation and legalese that might tie a complicated situation up in knots. Like in everything from The Dark Knight to Dunkirk, stakes do the talking — Oppenheimer must end the war. Throughout time he wrestles with turbulent family life, the burial scrutiny of a blacklist-giddy government that wants names of his Communist pals, and the heartbreaking fact that the Jewish people, his people, are under attack… but it all comes back to the bomb. There’s a ticking clock, and yet again, Nolan takes full advantage.

Part heist movie, part courtroom drama, part dreamscape, the swirl of Oppenheimer is at constant crescendo thanks to a kinetic camera, Ludwig Göransson’s humming score, and what might be the most stacked cast in movie history. Every IMAX-sized close-up of Cillian Murphy reveals layers to Oppenheimer that are easily assumed. Robert Downey Jr. takes the right lessons from Tony Stark to imbue Oppenheimer’s political adversary, Lewis Strauss, with swagger. Emily Blunt, Florence Pugh, Josh Hartnett, Rami Malek, Kenneth Branagh, and so many more all show up to deliver — and yet there’s still room for The Santa Clause’s David Krumholtz to be the MVP. They all fire off life-or-death lines, sweat under the pressure of the job, stagger backward when they realize what they’ve done, and under the eye of Nolan, reach the quantum realm of impossible choices. Oppenheimer has a magnitude worthy of the Trinity tests, but most admirable is that it never fetishizes the accomplishment of the bomb. The end will leave a person absolutely furious, as it must. —MP",The best movies of 2023 so far,https://www.polygon.com/what-to-watch/23597815/best-movies-2023,Polygon

Mattel has been criticised for its new Barbie doll honouring Wilma Mankiller, the first female Principal Chief of the Cherokee Nation.

Last month, Mattel announced that it was releasing a doll of Mankiller, who inspired countless Native American children as a powerful but humble leader who expanded early education and rural healthcare. The creation of the doll is part of the toy company’s “Inspiring Women” series. On 6 December, the Cherokee Nation also hosted an event to to celebrate the Wilma Mankiller Barbie.

Mankiller was the nation’s first female Principal Chief, leading the tribe for a decade until 1995. She focused on improving social conditions through consensus and on restoring pride in Native heritage. The social worker, who died in 2010, met snide remarks about her surname — a military title — with humour, often delivering a straight-faced response: “Mankiller is actually a well-earned nickname.”

As noted by Mattel, the Barbie doll of Mankiller portrays her dark hair, as the toy “wears a richly pigmented turquoise dress with ribbon striping that represents the four directions: north, south, east and west”. The toy also comes with a basket, with her look inspired by an iconic photo of Mankiller where she’s holding a woven basket.

However, Mattel has now faced some criticism over the doll, with people calling the toy company out for inaccuracies. Chuck Hoskin Jr, Principal Chief of the Cherokee Nation, noted to The New York Times that the doll’s basket wasn’t authentically Cherokee. He also specified that the wrong sets of symbols used for the Cherokee language were included in the packaging of the doll. As a result, the symbols on the package read “Chicken Nation” as opposed to Cherokee Nation”.

“To someone who doesn’t read Cherokee syllabary, they’re not going to notice it,” he said. “To the Cherokee people for whom Wilma is of such enduring significance and we have such enduring love for her, to see our seal incorrect, it’s very disappointing because it would not have taken much effort or thought to avoid that.”

Hoskin specified that he learned about the creation of the doll six months ago, and that Mattel did not work directly with the Cherokee Nation. However, he specified that the company has been understanding of the criticism.

“After some of the problems were revealed, we had very good conversations with Mattel. And I think they responded internally to us in a very thoughtful way and expressed some regret for not engaging us,” he said.

The Cherokee Nation issued a statement regarding the criticism. “Regrettably, the Mattel company did not work directly with the tribal government’s design and communications team to secure the official Seal or verify it,” the tribe said.

Mattel spokesperson Devin Tucker said the company is aware of the problem with the syllabary and is “discussing options”. The company worked with Mankiller’s estate, which is led by her husband, Charlie Soap, and her friend, Kristina Kiehl, on the creation of the doll.

Some Cherokee women were also critical of the doll, with claims that Mattel overlooked the problematic details on the doll and the packaging.

“Mixed emotions shared by me and many other Cherokee women who have now purchased the product revolve around whether a Wilma Barbie captures her legacy, her physical features and the importance of centering Cherokee women in decision making,” Stacy Leeds, the law school dean at Arizona State University and a former Cherokee Nation Supreme Court justice, told The Associated Press in an email.

Regina Thompson, a Cherokee basket weaver who grew up near Tahlequah, doesn’t think the doll looks like Mankiller. Mattel should have considered traditional pucker toe moccasins, instead of black shoes, and included symbols on the basket that Cherokees use to tell a story, she said.

“Wilma’s name is the only thing Cherokee on that box,” Thompson said. “Nothing about that doll is Wilma, nothing.”

Following the release of the doll in November, Hoskin had issued a statement to express how meaningful the creation was to the Cherokee Nation.

“When Native girls see it, they can achieve it, and Wilma Mankiller has shown countless young women to be fearless and speak up for Indigenous and human rights. She not only served in a role dominated by men during a time that tribal nations were suppressed, but she led,” he said. “Wilma Mankiller is a champion for the Cherokee Nation, for Indian Country, and even my own daughter. She truly exemplifies leadership, culture and equality and we applaud Mattel for commemorating her in the Barbie Inspiring Women Series.”

Mankiller, whose likeness is on a US quarter issued in 2021, is the second Native American woman honoured with a Barbie doll. Famed aviator Bessie Coleman, who was of Black and Cherokee ancestry, was depicted earlier this year. Other dolls in the “Inspiring Women” series include Maya Angelou, Ida B Wells, Jane Goodall and Madam CJ Walker.

But with each element they can harness bringing its own unique effect, it can be easy to get overwhelmed when trying to design a Sorcerer build. That’s where we come in, with our suggestions of the best Sorcerer builds for Diablo 4 season 2.

Sorcerers are capable of harnessing lightning to deal with crowds, ice to keep the hordes at bay, and fire to burn the demons of hell. But they’re also able to enchant their own spells with unique effects, intricately combining abilities for devastating results.

In this Diablo 4 guide, we’ve gathered and simplified the best Diablo 4 Sorcerer builds for season 2. If you need even more information on item affixes or other more complex ideas, we’ve been sure to link out to the more detailed versions of these builds, as well as where to find their original creators.

Best Sorcerer leveling build

This build is based off Lexyu’s Sorcerer leveling guide at IcyVeins, and is purely for leveling: i.e., allocating your 58 skill points between levels 1 and 50. If you want more detailed information about the item affixes you want to look for on your gear, or which other Legendary powers are great for your build, check out the original IcyVeins guide.

Best skills for leveling

This Sorcerer build guide is going to see you harness the awesome power of Lightning to speed through the leveling process. There are a few options for Core skills here, but we’re specifically going to be showing you Lexyu’s Chain Lightning variation. In this build, you’ll also use Frost Bolt, Teleport, Frost Nova, Lightning Spear, and Ice Armor.

Here are the best skills for a Sorcerer leveling build, organized by the exact order you should purchase them in — bearing in mind that some skills require you to allocate a number of skill points in the tree in order to unlock them. As such, you’ll need to unlock new skills before enhancing existing ones:

Level 15: Fireball

Level 30: Chain Lightning

Best Legendary Aspects for Sorcerer leveling build

When you first start your new character, complete these three dungeons first in order to collect their Aspects. Then place them on a piece of gear (ideally jewelry, when possible). Just keep in mind that you should replace these Legendaries with new versions using the imprint system every few levels.

Recharging Aspect (Zenith in Fractured Peaks) — Each time Chain Lightning bounces off you, gain X Mana

(Zenith in Fractured Peaks) — Each time Chain Lightning bounces off you, gain X Mana Aspect of Control (Sunken Library in Kehjistan) — You deal X% more damage to Immobilized, Stunned, or Frozen enemies

Best skill points for Sorcerer Firewall endgame build

This build utilizes Firewall as its core skill and main means of dealing damage. It also uses Fire Bolt, Inferno, Teleport, Ice Armor, and Flame Shield.

Vampiric Powers for Sorcerer Firewall build

Season 2 adds the new Vampiric Powers, which allow you to slot five additional abilities into your character to give you new effects. There are 22 total Vampiric Powers, and each are class agnostic, meaning they’re not unique to any one class.

Northwar recommends these five Vampiric Powers:

Anticipation

Prey on the Weak

Flowing Veins

Metamorphosis

To slot those powers you’ll need to have these Pacts available on your armor:

9 Ferocity

5 Divinity

4 Eternity

Legendary Powers and Uniques for Sorcerer Firewall build

To make this build work, you’re going to need powerful Legendary Powers and Unique items to augment your build.

Northwar recommends these items:

Helm : Shared Misery (dungeon drop) or Godslayer Crown (Unique)

: Shared Misery (dungeon drop) or Godslayer Crown (Unique) Chest : Snowveiled (dungeon drop) or Raiment of the Infinite (Unique)

If you want to get into the nitty gritty of stat priorities, refer to Northwar’s original guide.

Paragon Boards for Sorcerer Firewall build

The Paragon Board system is very complex, and you’ll want to carefully pair your Glyphs with specific boards for your class:

Starter Board / Reinforced Glyph Burning Instinct / Destruction Glyph Searing Heat / Adept Glyph Static Surge / Control Glyph Enchantment Master / Exploit

You should level your Glyphs to 15 in this specific order:

Destruction Control Adept Exploit Reinforced

You can path your own way through the Paragon Boards following these basic guidelines. However, for the best results, follow Northwar’s path exactly.

How to make a great Sorcerer build

Sorcerers are Diablo 4’s pure caster class, and use elemental magic to differentiate from the spells of the Druid and Necromancer. The Sorcerer has six Key Passives, but only three elements, which is what you’ll base your build around:

Lightning

Fire

Ice

Lightning builds utilize Lightning skills to deal with large groups of enemies at once. When making a Lightning build, you’ll end up using the Overflowing Energy Key Passive or the Vyr’s Master Key Passive, depending on if you’re in melee range or not.

Ice builds specialize in slowing enemies down, making it easier to survive their attacks. Ice builds will take advantage of either the Avalanche Key Passive or the Shatter Key Passive, depending on how much your build relies on crowd control

Fire builds are all about big explosions and burning your enemies. For these builds, you’ll typically use either the Combustion Key Passive for burning enemies or the Esu’s Ferocity Key Passive for chunky critical strikes.

When making your own build for a Sorcerer, you’ll likely end up sticking to one element for your main damage sources. But that’s not the most important thing you need to remember. Sorcerers die very, very easily in Diablo 4, and they have the weakest defensive stats by far — however, they can deal a massive amount of damage when built correctly. If you don’t want to end up dead more often than not, make sure to invest heavily in defensive skills while making your way toward one of the six Key Passives we listed above.

How to make a great Barbarian build

Barbarians are Diablo 4’s only pure melee class, with the other classes having hybrid builds for multiple ranges. There are four main ideas that all Barbarian builds stem from:

Fury dumping (most popular in Diablo 4’s pre-season)

Weapon swapping

Bleed

Berserk

Fury dump builds make use of the Unbridled Rage Key Passive, which causes your Fury spenders to cost double the Fury but deal more than double the damage. These kinds of builds obviously require very steady Fury generation, as it’s easy to starve yourself. Berserk builds that use the Unconstrained Key Passive are all about keeping your Barbarian in the Berserk stage at all times, which nets you a hefty bonus. All Barbarian builds will likely use some skills that make them go Berserk, the Unconstrained Key Passive just enhances the effect.

Bleed builds use the Gushing Wounds Key Passive to create a critical strike heavy build that’s great for whittling down groups of enemies with damage over time and explosions. Weapon swapping builds offer what is almost certainly the most unique playstyle for Barbarians and takes advantage of the Walking Arsenal Key Passive. The idea here is that you’re constantly swapping between your skills and weapons to give yourself massive damage buffs.

When making a build, you want to have one of these Key Passives in mind and choose your skills accordingly. Thankfully skills that share certain aspects (like Bleed) are color-coded on the skill tree, and you can even use the in-game search function to find them all. Other Barbarian builds let you take advantage of mechanics like Thorns or Shouts. But they still typically end with one of these Key Passives.

The 11- and 12-year-olds came together to give their friend Annika the newly released Taylor Swift CD in hopes of cheering up the friend after she broke her wrist during soccer practice, mom Shannon Schmidt told Fox News Digital.

""The girls knew what a CD was, but we had to borrow Grandma and Grandpa’s CD player to let them fully experience it,"" Schmidt shared.

COUPLE'S VIRAL 'TAYLOR SWIFT JAR' HAS WIFE PAYING A QUARTER WHENEVER SHE MENTIONS THE STAR

The video captures the comical moment the three sixth and seventh graders attempted to open the CD.

The girls — Lilly, Henslee and Annika — can be heard struggling to figure out how to get the CD out without breaking it or looking for a button to press in order to release it from the case.

Schmidt watched the girls' efforts, saying, ""You guys are making me laugh because this is how we used to listen to music.""

Seconds later, Lilly can be seen pressing the middle of CD, releasing it from the case.

The girls were amazed when they finally were able to get their hands on the soundtrack.

The mothers of the girls could not help but laugh as they realized just how different things are now, thanks to technology.

""Watching the girls grapple with the CD case felt like stepping back in time,"" Jody, one of the moms, told Fox News Digital.

This hilarious moment not only brought laughter to the three moms, but to the scores of viewers who have seen the video on TikTok as well.

Since it was uploaded, the video has garnered over 2.7 million views and 5,952 comments — one written by Taylor Swift herself.

Philips, along with Sony, co-developed the technology, which is a portable medium that can record, store and play back audio, video and other data in digital form.

entertainment,,2023-11-23T08:50:55+00:00,"Plucky little cranberries have grown for millennia amid sandy soils and short summers of southeastern Massachusetts and Cape Cod.

The Pilgrims explored and then settled this same area in 1620 — and celebrated the first Thanksgiving the following year.

""When the Pilgrims first set foot on Cape Cod, even before they saw Plymouth Rock, they may have well stepped on the American cranberry,"" Richard S. Cox and Jacob Walker write in their book, ""Massachusetts Cranberry Culture: A History from Bog to Table.""

Their 2012 book is a romantic ode to the quirks of New England history, geography and culture — and of its low-growing fruit.

MEET THE AMERICAN WHO GAVE THE NATION OUR THANKSGIVING ORIGIN STORY: PILGRIM EDWARD WINSLOW

It ""seems doubtful,"" however, that the Pilgrims even noticed the cranberries.

""For all its tasty charms, the cranberry is hardly the sort to attract attention,"" Cox and Walker say in their book.

The tart, colorful cranberry's native habitat around the Pilgrim settlement in Plymouth, and its ascension to a uniquely vibrant place on America’s Thanksgiving dinner table, are something of a coincidence — and a 20th-century phenomenon.

Credit cranberry king Marcus Urann, a true innovator of American agriculture.

""When the Pilgrims first set foot on Cape Cod … they may have well stepped on the American cranberry.""

Urann, most notably, invented cranberry sauce — at least the commercial canned cranberry jelly central to Thanksgiving celebrations nationwide today.

The bookish boy from Maine became an influential college scholar and then a Boston attorney before giving up the bar for the bogs.

Urann purchased cranberry farms in Massachusetts early in the 20th century. He introduced a way to put cranberries in a can in 1912.

Cranberries are one of the few fruits native to the northern United States. But they have only a brief autumn harvest from late September to early November and a short shelf life.

Fresh cranberries were known only in a few areas of the nation that possess the right combination of sandy soil, long summers days and long winter dormancy.

SEN. MARSHA BLACKBURN ON THANKSGIVING BLESSINGS, INCLUDING FAMILY, FOOD, COUNTRY: ‘TIME TO EXPRESS GRATITUDE’

Urann turned this hyper-local fruit into an international industry — and changed the flavor of gratitude in the United States.

""Marcus Urann was very influential in expanding the cranberry market,"" Brian Wick, executive director of Massachusetts Cranberries, told Fox News Digital.

""And that influence is still felt today.""

His influence is also felt today far from the soil and of the cranberry bog — in the halls of American academia.

‘Let the love of learning rule humanity’

Marcus Libby Urann was born on Oct. 3, 1873, to Marcus M. and Chestina Urann in Sullivan, Maine, a tiny Downeast town on Bar Harbor.

MEET THE AMERICAN WHO FOUNDED THE AMERICAN LEGION, THEODORE ROOSEVELT, JR., PRIVILEGED TO FIGHT AND TO SERVE

He described himself as a ""bookworm"" in one letter. He attended the University of Maine, where he became an undergraduate scholar of great renown and great vision.

He was apparently aware of the gift of his intellect at a young age. He was also raised to believe, or grew to believe by college, that those born with great gifts were also born with great responsibility to the nation.

He founded a society of elite students at the University of Maine to charge the school's best and brightest with using their intellect for the wider good.

It's known today as Phi Kappa Phi, a nationwide honor society of the nation's best students.

""An analysis of the men in my class convinced me that some of our brightest men were in danger of contributing less to society … than their ability justified."" — Marcus Urann

""Under the leadership of student Marcus L. Urann, who created the bylaws and constitution for the organization, the group formed the Lambda Sigma Eta Society,"" Phi Kappa Phi states today — recognizing Urann, more than 125 years later, as the father of the program while a student.

""Upon Urann's graduation, the school's president Abram Harris led the way for promoting the Society.""

His society was renamed Phi Kappa Phi in 1900, from the letters of the Greek words forming its motto, Philosophía Krateítõ Phõtôn – ""Let the love of learning rule humanity.""

‘BEST HOMEMADE’ THANKSGIVING TURKEY GRAVY THE WHOLE FAMILY WILL LOVE: TRY THE RECIPE

The group soon found advocates at Pennsylvania State College (now University) and the University of Tennessee, before spreading nationally and internationally.

Phi Kappa Phi chapters are found at more than 325 campuses in the U.S. and at schools as far away as the Philippines.

It remains true to Urann's mission to ""engage the community of scholars in service to others.""

""An analysis … of the men in my class convinced me that some of our brightest men were in danger of contributing less to society, to the university and to the state, than their ability justified us in expecting,"" Urann wrote of his endeavor in 1924.

""I wanted the ability of the high-rank man to be made most useful to society; also, I was looking for something which would be an inspiration to all students to work for high rank and I believed that uniting those men who were interested would be helpful.""

Urann himself became an attorney in Boston after graduation. But in 1906, he decided to give it up to buy cranberry bogs in and around Cape Cod and Plymouth.

'Simple, insignificant-looking plant’

Pilgrim Edward Winslow provided our only contemporary account of the first Thanksgiving. He mentions only fowl and deer, and ""our harvest being gotten in.""

The harvest certainly included corn, scholars believe.

The rest of the ""harvest"" upon which they feasted is unknown.

""But there is no evidence the Pilgrims had cranberries at the first Thanksgiving,"" said Wick of Massachusetts Cranberries, despite the fact they are one of the few fruits native to North America that grow in the northern United States.

It might have just been overlooked — as authors Cox and Walker suspect.

""There is no evidence the Pilgrims had cranberries at the first Thanksgiving."" — Brian Wick

They cite colonial settler John Josselyn, who wrote in 1672 that the cranberry is nothing but ""a small trailing plant"" and a humble vine ""that grows over Salt Marshes that are overgrown with moss.""

Benjamin Eastwood, touted by Cox and Walker as one of the cranberry’s ""greatest promoters,"" spoke only in humble terms of his beloved fruit.

He called the cranberry a ""simple, insignificant-looking plant"" and a ""stunted barren thing.""

Urann saw the cranberry differently. He saw a global industry crawling along the bogs of Massachusetts.

""After he set up cooking facilities at a packinghouse in Hanson, Massachusetts, he began to consider ways to extend the short selling season of the berries,"" Smithsonian Magazine reported in a 2013 history of cranberries.

""Canning them, in particular, he knew would make the berry a year-round product.""

In 1912, Urann began processing gelled cranberries in cans — cranberry sauce.

""As modest as this seems, Urann's maneuver was revolutionary,"" write Cox and Walker. ""For a fruit that had been marketed almost exclusively as a fresh product, it was a radical proposal to cook and to can.""

Most importantly, cranberries could now be sold to consumers far from where they were grown.

Urann pioneered other innovations in cranberry farming, too, including the process of wet-harvesting cranberries.

""For a fruit that had been marketed almost exclusively as a fresh product, it was a radical proposal to cook and to can.""

The tiny berries were usually plucked from dried vines by migrant workers. But cranberries, each filled with four chambers of air, float easily.

Urann realized the bog could be floated, the berries agitated from their vines, and easily rounded up while floating in the water.

Urann teamed up with fellow leaders of cranberry farming John Makepeace and Elizabeth Lee to create Ocean Spray, still headquartered in Massachusetts to this day.

The name is synonymous with cranberry juice and cranberry sauce.

Ocean Spray is one of the world's most successful farming cooperatives. It's helped spread cranberry farming around the country and around the world — and put cranberry juices and sauces in international markets.

Ocean Spray cranberry sauce remains its signature product. The company first sold its cranberry sauce nationally in 1941 — its ridged cranberry gel a familiar site on Thanksgiving tables around the United States.

‘Everything in life is what you do for others'

Marcus L. Libby died on April 1, 1963 in Hanson, Massachusetts, where he rests in a family plot in Fernhill Cemetery.

""I do believe that anyone can do anything that he really desires to accomplish,"" Urann wrote as a young man 1924, explaining the history of Phi Kappa Phi.

He lived by that example throughout his life.

""A recognized giant of the cranberry industry,"" The Boston Globe wrote in his April 4 obituary, dubbing Urann the ""Cranberry King.""

""He bought his first cranberry bog on [Cape Cod] in 1906. During the next 30 years, he built his bog holding into a complex throughout southeastern Massachusetts.""

MEET THE AMERICAN WHO FIRST PLANTED APPLES IN THE COLONIES: WILLIAM BLAXTON, ECCENTRIC SETTLER

The report of his death added, ""He formed a cooperative which eventually dominated the industry, and organized a canning operation which grew into the industry’s single biggest buyer and distributor.""

Cranberries were available only in the autumn and only fresh when Urann bought his first cranberry bog in 1906.

Ocean Spray reports today that fresh cranberries account for only 5% of the fruit's production — a testament to the exponential explosion of the industry inspired by Urann.

They are sold internationally as sauce in juice, much as Urann first conceived in 1912.

The United States is easily the world’s largest grower of a fruit essential to the flavor of its national holiday dinner table.

American farmers grow twice as many cranberries as No. 2 Canada and about 20 times the production of third-place Chile, according to data from the Cranberry Institute in Carver, Massachusetts, next to Plymouth.

The state of Wisconsin, meanwhile, surpassed Massachusetts decades ago as the nation’s top cranberry grower.

Six out of 10 Americans say that cranberry sauce has and always will be on their Thanksgiving table, while more than one third say they ""can’t live without"" cranberry sauce on Thanksgiving, according to Ocean Spray.

Cranberry bogs remain a signature of the landscape in the land of the Pilgrims.

""I felt I could do something for New England. You know, everything in life is what you do for others."" — Marcus Urann

""For Massachusetts and for this region, they’re so much a part of our history and our culture,"" said Wick. ""They’ve been part of a fabric of our region from Indigenous people until today.""

Urann saw what cranberries could be far beyond the land of the Pilgrims.

""I felt I could do something for New England,"" Urann told the Associated Press in a story that ran around the nation on Thanksgiving in 1959.

entertainment,Sarah Berry,2023-12-01T18:00:00+00:00,"“Often a really big mistake parents make is they impose the models of career success that were relevant when they were finishing school,” says the 42-year-old father of three. Loading For instance, before the global financial crisis, he witnessed parents telling their children that the path to a stable and lucrative career meant getting a degree in finance and a job in banking. “Then all those positions disappeared. It was stunning to watch.” The idea that arts degrees are “useless” is a fallacy, Grant adds. He points to a 2019 study suggesting parents pushed their children towards STEM degrees because they believed those careers would pay well. In the “salary race”, it is true that the science, technology, engineering and maths graduates earn more initially. But those who study history, English or social science degrees and are taught problem-solving, critical thinking and adaptability ultimately catch up, often surpassing their STEM contemporaries.

“Parents may well push their kids in directions that seem to be really practical, but don’t know what employers actually value,” says Grant. “There’s such a premium on the character skills or what some people call soft skills or behavioural skills: communication, teamwork, leadership.” Soft skills, a term that originated in the 1960s from US Army psychologists tasked with developing proficiency in soldiers beyond the literal “hard skills” of working with weapons and machines, are becoming increasingly important in a world where technology may replace other jobs. Adam Grant has advice for parents who want to help their kids reach their potential. Grant recounts chatting with a “very influential person in tech”, who told Grant it was impossible to plan a career more than a couple of years ahead – when he graduated from university, the likes of Mark Zuckerberg and Elon Musk hadn’t yet finished school. “We couldn’t predict what kinds of companies were going to exist, and we didn’t know what kinds of jobs were going to exist,” he says.

Now, generative AI is upending work in brand-new ways and inevitably changing the future of work and jobs yet again: “I think it’s awfully arrogant to assume that you can tell your kids what a stable career looks like.” By directing our kids down a path that is not of their choosing, there are several likely outcomes, Grant suggests. “I think it’s awfully arrogant to assume that you can tell your kids what a stable career looks like.” Adam Grant They fail to thrive, or burnout because they end up in a job that is not aligned with their values, interests and skills; they resent you; or they rebel and deliberately do the opposite. How, then, can parents support their children to achieve their potential?

Potential is not innate, it’s developed Seeing natural talent in others can make us discount our own – or our kid’s – abilities in a certain area, as can admiring someone at their peak without considering how far they’ve come. Loading Yet in Grant’s book, he illustrates the experiences of those whose potential was not immediately obvious – including his own. Though Grant eventually became a diver on the junior Olympic team, when he first tried out for his school diving team, it seemed like a hopeless pursuit. The coach told him that the sport required grace and flexibility, but that Grant walked like Frankenstein, couldn’t touch his toes, and the coach was quite sure his grandmother could outjump him.

Similarly, though he has become a New York Times bestselling author three times, he failed the mandatory writing test in his first year at Harvard and was instructed to do a remedial writing course – one reserved for “jocks and international students who spoke English as a fifth language”. “A lot of people believe passion is out in the world waiting to be discovered,” Grant tells me. “If you can just turn over the right stone you’ll find the thing you love.” “Parents may well push their kids in directions that seem to be really practical, but don’t know what employers actually value,” says Grant. Credit: Janie Barrett It’s hard to enjoy something when we find it hard, or we are failing. But progress can be a result of passion, just as passion is an outcome of progress. “Too often what we do is take on a new hobby or skill or task and say, ‘Oh this is not fun, it’s not for me’, as opposed to saying, ‘I’m not good at this yet, let me see once I get a little better if I like it’.”

In both writing and diving, he focused on his own growth and progress and relied on the guidance of credible mentors (in Grant’s case, his diving coach, who was ultimately his greatest champion, and teachers who knew him well and believed in his capacity to be a great writer). Loading How do you know if you’ve achieved your potential? We often look to extrinsic rewards – titles, money, awards – as the metrics of success. But, Grant argues: “They are status symbols that we use to broadcast to others and to ourselves that we matter and I think they are really poor proxies for mattering. I think we have all been in situations where we can admire people not for what they’ve achieved but for who they’ve become or what they’ve contributed to others.”",Want to help your kids achieve their potential?

entertainment,,2023-12-09T19:46:55+00:00,"Pressures are high for parents and caregivers around the holidays.

That means there’s room for error, according to parenting expert Hannah Keeley, who offered up some of the biggest mistakes parents tend to make at Christmastime.

In an email she sent to Fox News Digital, Virginia-based Keeley identified the top five holiday blunders that parents often make.

HOME FOR THE HOLIDAYS? HERE'S HOW TO AVOID STRESS AROUND FAMILY MEMBERS, ACCORDING TO EXPERTS

Here are the mistakes Keeley thinks parents should try to avoid.

Diving right in …

1. Creating unrealistic expectations

Parents who make a ""must-do"" Christmas list that’s a ""mile long"" at the ""first sniff of peppermint mochas"" are perhaps setting themselves up for failure — and Keeley said she empathized with this instinct.

Doing the most could lead to a season of disappointment, she warned.

CHRISTMAS TREE SHOPPING? HERE'S HOW TO SELECT THE PERFECT ONE FOR YOU

""Aside from the time I asked my husband to turn our bathroom into a Hallmark movie and he actually pulled it off, unrealistic expectations around Christmas usually just set up moms for inevitable disappointment,"" Keeley said.

""Beautiful family Christmas memories can be made without the drive-in ‘Grinch’ movie, the tacky light tour and the neighborhood Christmas cookie bake-off all in the same weekend.""

Instead, parents should ""take it easy and leave plenty of room to relax,"" said Keeley.

2. Using Christmas as a bribe

While it’s easy for parents to use a message of ""be good or else"" as a parenting tactic before Santa Claus comes down the chimney, Keeley said this approach lowers parenting standards.

""I refer to this tactic as ‘stooping to Santa,’"" she said. ""Don’t lower your parenting standards to bribery, especially around a season and a character that is supposed to symbolize peace and goodwill on Earth.""

The Santa bribe turns the focus of Christmas into ""selfish gain on the part of your children,"" Keeley added.

""Love your kids enough to learn how to manage their behavior appropriately and teach them self-discipline.""

""It’s also lazy parenting, which never pays off in the long run,"" she said. ""Being a mom is a professional career and deserves to be treated accordingly.""

She added, ""Love your kids enough to learn how to manage their behavior appropriately and teach them self-discipline.""

3. Becoming a ‘holiday martyr’

It’s important to keep the holidays well-rounded, Keeley said.

5 HOLIDAY DECORATING MISTAKES THAT COULD REDUCE YOUR CHEER THIS YEAR

She called out ""martyr moms"" who are at their ""peak performance"" during Christmastime, putting everyone else before themselves.

""They wear themselves out making sure everyone else has the perfect Christmas, but never put themselves on the receiving end,"" she said.

These parents, said Keeley, ""subconsciously compensate for a lack of self-worth and validate their role as a [parent] by creating too much busyness in their life.""

She said that ""all that results from a mom who runs herself into the ground is just that: a mom who runs herself into the ground.""

DELICIOUS CUT-OUT SUGAR COOKIES FOR CHRISTMAS: TRY THE SIMPLE RECIPE

She added, ""If this is you, take a breath, put away the to-do list and ask yourself, ‘What would I have to believe in order to have a relaxed and joyful Christmas?’ Maybe we can use that as a guide to sit back and relax.""

4. Griping like the Grinch

Parents should be sure not to be ""grinchy"" around their kids amid holiday stress, Keeley said.

Children up to the age of 9 process information egocentrically, she said — which means if there’s a problem, they see themselves as the cause.

With this in mind, parents should avoid ""processing their frustration around the holidays audibly around the children,"" she said.

""The ‘mom brain’ is wired to process problems rapidly and move on to solutions,"" she said. ""The ‘child brain,’ however, is wired to process a problem internally and take on the responsibility.""

Said Keeley, ""Knowing this, make sure you don’t do any ‘grinchy griping’ out loud to the children. You may see it as temporary venting, but they see it as, ‘Mom is upset and I’m probably the reason.’""

Instead, parents should stay calm, find a reason to be grateful and vocalize it, even when frustrations accumulate.

5. Neglecting the ‘give list’

While building a wish list is fun for kids, Keeley emphasized the moral importance of the ""give list.""

""Many parents make the mistake of teaching their children that Christmas is a time to make a ‘wish list’ and get what they want,"" she said.

""Many parents make the mistake of teaching their children that Christmas is a time to make a ‘wish list’ and get what they want.""

""This is loads of fun, but can often create a big case of 'the gimmes’ in your children.""

She added, ""Life is balance. It’s about receiving and giving.""

As parents guide their kids to create a wish list, Keeley encouraged them to spend equal time creating a list of gifts to give to family and friends.

""Collaborate with them on what they want to give to the people they love, and encourage them to use their imagination and creative ability, not just your credit card,"" she said.

Got it Normal text size Larger text size Very large text size The corporate and creative philosophy behind streaming television is in a state of flux, and now the cracks in the prevailing wisdom are starting to appear. Take, for instance, the value of exclusivity. For the past five or so years entertainment companies have been focused on creating their own streaming platforms, which would be built around exclusive control of their original content, whether it was original new series or a sister studio’s Hollywood movies. But now that income is desired most, some streamers are once again willing to sell non-exclusive rights to others. In December, one of the best original shows on Paramount+, the compelling horror-laced drama Yellowjackets, will become available on Netflix (see below for my recommendation). Netflix gets a buzzy show the vast majority of its subscribers have never had access to, while Paramount+ earns a rights payment and broadens the audience for Yellowjackets, which has a third season commissioned. Streaming’s walls are crumbling. That said, there are still plenty of promising new shows and movies, most of them exclusive to their services, debuting in December. Whether you’re after an awards season blockbuster (Netflix’s Maestro) or an Australian comic-drama (Binge’s Strife), your watchlist should be well loaded. Netflix Bradley Cooper stars as legedary conductor-composer Leonard Bernstein in Maestro. Credit: Jason McDonald/Netflix My top Netflix recommendation is Maestro (December 20). Not since Warren Beatty in the late 1970s has a Hollywood leading man so completely – perhaps obsessively – given themselves over to filmmaking as Bradley Cooper. The credit he banked from starring in the Hangover comedies, Silver Linings Playbook, and American Sniper let Cooper co-write, direct and star in the 2018 hit A Star is Born. He now fills the same three positions in another movie about a tormented musician: the superstar American conductor and composer Leonard Bernstein. Cooper bristles at the term biopic, and instead the film focuses on Bernstein’s conducting, his nurturing marriage to Felicia Montealegre (Carey Mulligan), and his parallel relationships with male lovers. There’s no Shallow to be found here, but Cooper appears to inhabit Bernstein across decades and the film is primed for the Academy Awards.

Also on Netflix: Few shows recently have cast a spell as intense as Yellowjackets (December 15), a now-and-then horror thriller about a group of deeply divided 40-something women forced to confront the grim but unspoken reality of how they endured 18 months marooned in the Canadian wilderness as teenagers. With Juliette Lewis, Melanie Lynskey and Christina Ricci among the survivors, the story is a mix of supernatural menace, black comedy, teenage adversity, and deeply expressed trauma. It’s coming to Netflix after two years on Paramount+ and it’s a can’t-look-away binge just waiting to happen. When the history of the high-concept Hollywood blockbuster is written, Zack Snyder’s name will be prominent – for better or worse. Snyder is responsible for 300, Man of Steel, and most of Justice League, and having come to Netflix for the tepid zombie heist movie Army of the Dead he’s doubling down with Rebel Moon: Part One – A Child of Fire (December 22). A two-part space opera – the sequel is scheduled for next April – that Snyder originally pitched as a Star Wars spin-off, it’s a Seven Samurai-influenced epic about a former soldier, Kora (Atomic Blonde’s Sofia Boutella), who recruits a group of mercenaries (Charlie Hunnam, Djimon Hounsou) to defend the farmers on a moon threatened by the galaxy’s authoritarian ruler. Digital science-fiction spectacle is a given, but can Snyder deliver genuine emotional stakes? November highlights: David Fincher hit the mark with his assured hitman drama The Killer, documentary Last Stop Larrimah was a fascinating outback mystery, Robbie Williams was a star telling his own story, but prestige drama All the Light We Cannot See fell short. Binge Opal (BeBe Bettencourt), Christine (Maria Angelico), Jeeet (Olivia Junkeer), Penny (Bryony Skillington) and Evelyn (Asher Keddie) in Strife. Credit: Binge My top Binge recommendation is Strife (December 6). It’s not a direct adaptation, but this new Australian comic-drama about a woman trying to keep up with her own life is based on Mia Freedman’s 2017 memoir, Work Strife Balance. Asher Keddie, who has previously summed up the conflicting demands on professional women in Offspring and Paper Giants: The Birth of Cleo, plays the fictional Evelyn Jones, a blogger who strikes a chord and becomes an online publisher and media commentator just as her marriage is coming apart. Evelyn keeps getting pulled in every direction, a situation that should be both comically rich and smartly telling in the hands of the show’s creator, Sarah Scheller, who previously put together the terrific motherhood comedy The Letdown (currently on Netflix). The supporting cast includes Matt Day (Rake) and Jonathan LaPaglia (The Slap).

Also on Binge: I won’t spoil it, but there was a nerve-shredding cliffhanger in the first season of Vigil (December 11) that I still think about far too often. That’s a pretty strong indicator that this Scottish crime thriller, where a police detective was assigned to a murder investigation on board an on-duty British nuclear submarine, pushed the right buttons. The show’s second season stays on dry land but retains the military focus: when an attack drone demonstration at a British army base goes tragically wrong, Detective Chief Inspector Amy Silva (Suranne Jones, Gentleman Jack) and her now pregnant partner, Detective Sergeant Kirsten Longacre (Rose Leslie, Game of Thrones), are called in to investigate. Expect a fast pace and significant twists – this series doesn’t do quiet contemplation. November highlights: Comedy troupe Please Don’t Destroy flew the flag for 20-somethings with The Treasure of Foggy Mountain, picaresque comedy Bookie made the right bet, and Julia continued the celebrity chef biography of Julia Child. Stan* Claudia Karvan and Nathalie Morris in the new season of Bump. Credit: Stan My top Stan recommendation is Bump (December 26). It’s one of the best new traditions in Australian television: a new season of this tremendous Sydney-based comic-drama gets uploaded every Boxing Day. This is the fourth instalment of Kelsey Munro and Claudia Karvan’s show and one of the strong points about it is that each iteration places its ensemble cast in a testing new light. The high-school students of season one, Oly (Nathalie Morris) and Santi (Carlos Sanson Jr), who were thrown together when a hook-up turned into a teenage pregnancy, are now a career woman and stay-at-home dad while their daughter, Jacinda (Ava Cannon), is in primary school. Bump tugs at the heartstrings, but with hard-earned understanding and a feel for the contrary demands of family. Please keep it coming. Also on Stan: Revealed: Ben Roberts-Smith Truth on Trial (December 10) is a feature-length documentary that provides the inside story to one of Australia’s most contentious and headline-making pieces of investigative journalism: the five-year quest to unearth the truth behind rumours that the country’s most decorated living soldier, Ben Roberts-Smith, committed war crimes in Afghanistan. With stories in The Age and Sydney Morning Herald, as well as on 60 Minutes, journalists Nick McKenzie and Chris Masters pushed to bring the truth to the public, navigating divisions in the SAS and eventually the defamation trial that Roberts-Smith brought to court and lost. It’s been a compelling saga, and Dora Weekley’s documentary should include hitherto unknown details and unheard commentary.

I still haven’t got over the nightmarish sounds of a spinal surgery going very wrong in the first season, but nonetheless Dr Death (December 22) is back for a second serve of malpractice and monstrous medical egos. This American true crime drama is now an anthology. Every season is a different doctor whose abuse of privilege posed a criminal risk to their patients. The new season will cover Paolo Macchiarini, an Italian surgeon and researcher who was accused of laboratory fraud and manipulative behaviour. Fresh from Wolf Like Me, Edgar Ramirez plays Macchiarini, while Mandy Moore (This is Us) is Benita Alexander, the journalist who got dangerously close to the truth. November highlights: The final season of groundbreaking Canadian comedy Sort Of confirmed it as an under-the-radar gem, Scrublands was a tight Australian crime thriller, and science-fiction fans got a spin-off with Orphan Black: Echoes. Amazon Prime Alan Ritchson returns in Reacher. Credit: Amazon Prime My top Amazon Prime recommendation is Reacher (December 15). I am much heartened by the star of this American action series, Alan Ritchson, who decided that, despite looking like an absolute unit in the show’s first season, he nonetheless needed to add even more muscle for these new episodes to convincingly depict Jack Reacher. Adapted from Lee Child’s wildly successful novels about an off-the-grid former US military policeman – somehow the diminutive Tom Cruise played the role in a pair of movies – Reacher is an uncomplicated guy: he fixes wrongs with two fists and zero concerns. If anything, the first season was too subtle, so an even larger Reacher who drops deadpan one-liners while having access to a missile launcher seems promising. And I’m taking the under for the proposition of whether a ripped Reacher sheds his shirt within three episodes. Also on Amazon Prime: Recommending Prisoner’s Daughter (December 5) is a bet on talent. This domestic drama has a familiar outline, with an ageing and terminally ill criminal having his sentence commuted on the grounds that he lives with his estranged daughter, a single mother and Las Vegas waitress struggling to make ends meet and connect her son with a positive role model. Obviously, they’re going to belatedly bond in the face of increasingly fraught difficulties, but how that plays out will be guided by the performances of Brian Cox (Succession) and Kate Beckinsale (Laurel Canyon) as father and daughter, and the direction of Catherine Hardwicke, who found something genuine in the first Twilight movie before being replaced for the sequels by a succession of ill-equipped male filmmakers.

November highlights: The adult animated superhero drama Invincible returned with more cape fear, while the Bond franchise authorised a reality competition with 007: Road to a Million. Apple TV+ The Peanuts gang is back in The Snoopy Show - Happiness is Holiday Traditions. Credit: Apple TV+ My top Apple TV+ recommendation is The Snoopy Show: Happiness is Holiday Traditions (December 1). Just quietly, over the past two years Apple TV+ has been producing a nourishing stream of animated Snoopy content that is faithful to Charles M Schulz’s beloved comic strip, Peanuts. The spotted white beagle and his adolescent cohort – Charlie Brown, Marcie, Peppermint Patty, and many more – have always transferred easily from a panel on the page to an animation frame, and this official adaptation has a trademark mix of wry humour, flights of fantasy, and heartwarming camaraderie. Happiness is Holiday Traditions is a bonus special to close off the third season of the series, and it will stay true to the rule that helps make Peanuts endure: no adults are seen or heard. Also on Apple TV+: The trailer for Family Plan (December 15), an action-comedy feature where Mark Wahlberg plays a former master assassin who left the trade and secretly built a new life in the American suburbs as a cheerful husband and father, is goofy as all heck. The question is whether it’s ludicrous fun or just sappy shenanigans? Wahlberg’s Dan Morgan, who has to go on a Las Vegas road trip with his blissfully unaware family after his cover is blown, dispatching goons while carrying his youngest in a BabyBjorn and stunt driving in a family minivan are positive signs. Michelle Monaghan (True Detective) plays Mrs Morgan, who quietly thinks her husband is a little vanilla, and the fine Irish actor Ciaran Hinds (There Will Be Blood) goes full villain. November highlights: The Buccaneers placed a modern teen lens on Edith Wharton’s period marital drama, while Godzilla and pals returned for Monarchy: Legacy of Monsters and space race alternate history For All Mankind reached the 21st century.

Will Smith has spoken out about his “tumultuous” relationship with his wife, Jada Pinkett Smith, while speaking to a crowd of fans in Baltimore, Maryland.

The 55-year-old actor took the stage at the Enoch Pratt Free Library on 18 October, as he made an appearance at a press event for his wife’s book, Worthy, alongside their two children – Jaden, 25, and Willow, 22. His recent comments come after Jada made major revelations about their marriage in her memoir, including how she and Will have been separated for seven years.

During the event in Baltimore, Will began by speaking to the crowd about his love and admiration for his partner, who he married in 1997. “I just really wanted to come out and just be here and hold it down for you the way you have held it down for me,” he said during the event, as reported by The Baltimore Sun.

The King Richard star went on to describe the challenges and achievements he’s had throughout his marriage, adding: “We have had a very, very long and tumultuous [relationship]. We call it ‘brutiful.’ It was brutal and beautiful at the same time.""

At another point during the event, Will referred to his union with Jada as a “sloppy public experiment in unconditional love,” according to the Baltimore Banner. He went on to explain that he’s “happier than [he’s] ever been in [his] entire life” and praised Jada for continuing to be by his side.

“I have achieved every single thing I have ever wanted in my entire life. There is not one thing left that I desire in this world - all of the awards, all of the money, the family - everything I’ve ever dreamed,” he said. “And those dreams were largely built on the foundation of Jada’s sacrifices. There were many times when Jada put her career aside so I could follow the dreams of mine.”

The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air star thanked his wife for putting him “before herself” and for maintaining a good relationship with his ex-wife Sheree Zampino. Will and Zampino share a 30-year-old son, Trey Smith, who was also present for the book event at the Enoch Pratt Free Library. Speaking to the crowd, Will said that Jada’s positive relationship with Zampino allowed all three of his children the chance to grow up together.

“Can you show up and love somebody for the rest of your life, even when you don’t agree with them?” he asked. “Jada is the best friend I have ever had on this planet and I am going to show up for her and support her for the rest of my life.”

This isn’t the first time that Will has opened up about his relationship, as it’s continued to make headlines. Earlier this week, he appeared to mock the publicity storm surrounding him and Jada in a video titled “Official statement” shared on Instagram. “So, here’s the thing. My opinion is... uh…” the actor said, before sneezing into the crook of his arm. As he sneezed, the video comically zoomed out to show several different landscapes including lakes and mountains.

Prior to sharing the video, Smith showed his support for his partner and her success in a statement toThe New York Times. During the interview, the outlet noted that Smith said his wife’s memoir “kind of woke him up” and that he has now realised she is more “resilient, clever and compassionate than he’d understood”.

“When you’ve been with someone for more than half of your life, a sort of emotional blindness sets in, and you can all too easily lose your sensitivity to their hidden nuances and subtle beauties,” he added.

In an interview with People published on 10 October, Jada first revealed that she and her husband were living separately. “We’ve been doing some really heavy-duty work together,” she said. “We just got deep love for each other and we are going to figure out what that looks like for us.”

However, during an appearance on the Today show on 16 October, Jada clarified to Hoda Kotb that she and the Suicide Squad actor are “working hard” and are “concentrating on healing” to get their relationship to a better place.

Oct. 1: Messiah of Evil

Where to watch: Prime Video, Shudder, Pluto TV, Plex

A undersung classic of ’70s cosmic horror, Willard Huyck and Gloria Katz’s Messiah of Evil is a surreal and nightmarish experience that more than deserves its status as a cult horror classic.

The film centers on Arletty, a young woman who journeys to the remote coastal town of Point Dume, California, to track down her missing father, a reclusive painter who is plagued by disturbing visions of an impending apocalypse. After crossing paths with an eccentric aristocrat and his groupie companions, the group bears witness to the realization of the painter’s prophecy, as the townspeople are transformed into flesh-eating ghouls and the messiah of evil makes his return to the mortal realm.

At times convoluted and bizarre, Messiah of Evil is a genuinely entertaining horror thriller filled with memorable scares and chilling set-pieces. From a cross-eyed albino man gleefully devouring a field mouse whole to a unsuspecting woman watching a Western as the theater around her slowly fills with ravenous undead zombies, it’s a dreamy and frightening experience that lands somewhere between the ineffable gothic horror of H.P. Lovecraft and the anti-consumerist allegories of George A. Romero. The horrors hold up over 50 years after it was first released, and with just the right combination of inadvertent silliness and legitimate terror, Messiah of Evil is a satisfying watch and an excellent start to a month of horrors. —Toussaint Egan

Oct. 2: Ginger Snaps

Where to watch: Criterion Channel, Shudder, Peacock, Vudu, Tubi, Freevee, Plex

There’s a sizable hole in the monster movie canon: There just aren’t enough good werewolf movies! Ginger Snaps is here to fix that. And if you love Jennifer’s Body, you’re in for a bloody treat.

Directed by future Orphan Black co-creator John Fawcett, Ginger Snaps is a delightfully gruesome story about two sisters. One of them has gotten her period for the first time, and is turned into a werewolf shortly after. Things get messy, fast.

Ginger Snaps doesn’t just do a great job filling in the werewolf canon. It’s a grisly body horror story placed onto an effective puberty allegory, with a compelling central sister relationship. If you’ve ever watched something like Sam Raimi’s Spider-Man and thought, This is great and surprisingly gooey, but give me stories like this about teen girls, then Ginger Snaps is for you.

The movie has amassed a dedicated cult following in the years since its release. You’re next up to join the ranks — see you at the next full moon! —Pete Volk

Oct. 3: Creepshow

Where to watch: Kanopy

The new Creepshow home video release — presented in vibrant 4K UHD Blu-ray — is the best way to revisit this horror anthology classic. You can see individual bubbles in the foam of the ocean as it slowly drowns Ted Danson. This is why it made our list of the best Blu-rays of 2023.

But reader, while I’m one of those sickos who obsesses over video resolution and bitrate, I’ll be honest: You don’t need the fanciest version of Creepshow to enjoy its comedic chills. In fact, the most aesthetically harmonious format might be a poorly treated VHS tape that recorded the film off TBS in the mid-1990s.

Horror anthologies have most recently been used to condense as much terror into a tiny package, like chugging a shot glass of hot sauce. Creepshow is a throwback to a softer, more leisurely style of horror — a middle ground between the plodding tinglers of Poe and contemporary slashers.

Plus, Stephen King performs a one-person show as a hillbilly. So like, that should be enough. —Chris Plante

Oct. 4: Pulse

Where to watch: Prime Video

What if technology could be used to communicate with the dead? It’s an idea that dates as far back as the spiritualism movement of the late 19th century, and one that takes on a frightening and fascinating dimension in Kiyoshi Kurosawa’s post-Y2K horror-thriller Pulse.

Alternating between two storylines, Kurosawa’s film follows a group of young adults and university students as a rash of inexplicable disappearances and suicides occurs around Tokyo. As the protagonists investigate further, they slowly uncover a shocking revelation: The souls of the dead are spilling over into the mortal world and ensnaring their unsuspecting prey through the very infrastructure of the internet. By the time they realize this, however, it’s too late; the unearthly contagion has taken on a life of its own, and the only way to survive is cling to what few connections they have left.

Produced after Kurosawa’s Cure (which we featured on last year’s Halloween calendar), Pulse is widely celebrated as one of the foundational texts in the canon of J-horror cinema, alongside Hideo Nakata’s Ring and Takashi Shimizu’s Ju-on: The Curse. Eerie and methodical, Kurosawa’s film is a nihilistic meditation on technology and human relationships that presages an advent of loneliness in a world growing more and more “connected” with each passing day. Rife with imagery that will stay with you long after it’s over, Pulse is a tremendous and terrifying movie worth experiencing. —TE

Oct. 5: Apostle

Where to watch: Netflix

Don’t confuse Gareth Edwards (director of The Creator and Rogue One: A Star Wars Story) with Gareth Evans, director of the Raid movies. If you do, you may sit down to the Netflix-exclusive Apostle expecting expansive, detail-driven science fiction, and be unpleasantly surprised when you get a grimy, extremely gory period piece that goes to startling extremes.

Evans’ mesmerizing Apostle deliberately starts in roughly the same place as the classic 1973 suspense thriller The Wicker Man, with a lone man heading to a remote Welsh island after getting a letter suggesting his sister is being held against her will there by a dangerous cult. Worming his way into the community by pretending to be a convert, Thomas (Dan Stevens, even more feral and intense than he is in The Guest or Beauty and the Beast) inevitably discovers a lot of nasty work going on on the island.

Evans charts his own course with Apostle, veering far from the Wicker Man mold and into much bloodier territory. But he takes advantage of some of the same ideas: the ominous isolation of the island, the close-knit secrecy of its community, the predatory ideas that have flourished there under charismatic leadership. Stevens is particularly terrific in this movie, lunging from one scene to the next like a humanoid wolf who can barely contain his bloodlust. (Thomas has plenty of closely held secrets of his own.) And Evans’ commitment to violent mayhem gives this one some memorable moments that are likely to haunt you later, in the dark. —Tasha Robinson

Oct. 6: Dracula 2000

Where to watch: Max

With the scars of nu-metal having healed and Olivia Rodrigo’s Paramore-infused pop tracks having gone full “vampire,” now is the time to give Gerard Butler’s half-bare-chest take on Dracula the respect it’s due.

Maybe the most Dimension Films movie to ever bear the Dimension Films studio logo (close second: The Faculty), Dracula 2000 finds a group of thieves — including of-the-moment faces like Omar Epps, Jennifer Esposito, and Shane West! — transporting a stolen silver coffin from London to New Orleans. They think there’s treasure inside. Are they idiots? Absolutely. And when they find Dracula instead of gold doubloons or whatever, they unleash hell. Overacted, canted-angled, seven-string-guitar-plucking HELL. Luckily, as Dracula hunts down local college student Mary Van Helsing (Justine Waddell), with whom he already shares a psychic connection, Mary’s dad’s new vampire-hunter assistant Simon (young Jonny Lee Miller!) is on his tail.

Butler, never more a heartthrob, plays Dracula in a mesmerizing, baroque manner; think Nicolas Cage doing Dracula if this year’s Renfield was emo turn-of-the-millennium trash. And he’s constantly biting unsuspecting B-list actors to add to his army of hot people, who fight the heroes in multiple obligatory scenes of wire-fu. Writer-director Patrick Lussier cuts it all up like it’s the video for “Freak on a Leash,” and, well, objectively, it’s quite unlike most horror movies you can watch today! Enjoyment of Dracula 2000 may vary depending on a tolerance for Hot Topic goofs, but if you don’t catch up with it, you can’t enjoy Lussier’s sequel, Dracula II: Ascension, starring Jason Scott Lee as a martial-arts-fighting priest who kicks Dracula’s ass! —Matt Patches

Oct. 7: Prince of Darkness

Where to watch: Peacock

There aren’t enough movies about the end of the world. Sure, there are plenty of movies about preventing catastrophe at that scale, but rarely do they have the follow-through to truly get existentially terrifying. Thankfully, John Carpenter is no coward, and he made three movies about different kinds of apocalypses. But while The Thing is the best known, and In the Mouth of Madness is the zaniest, Prince of Darkness might be the scariest of the trilogy.

Prince of Darkness follows a group of college researchers who are sent to study a strange canister found in the basement of a church. The canister is filled with some kind of liquid that defies science, and when it starts to get released, a strange evil seems to come into the world with it.

This is Carpenter at his most ambitious. While most of this movie is set in just one building, all manner of horror makes its way inside. There are people made of bugs, horrific zombies, an extradimensional Satan, and things even worse to behold. The entire movie is an onslaught of creepy, skin-crawling images, all built out of a unique mythology about the relationship between good and evil that underpins the world. And, most importantly, after this parade of horrors seems to come to an end, Carpenter saves Prince of Darkness’ biggest, weirdest, most dreadful scare for last. —Austen Goslin

Oct. 8: Gravity Falls - Northwest Mansion Mystery

Where to watch: Hulu, Disney Plus (season 2, episode 10)

The more time that has passed since Gravity Falls concluded, the more miraculous it feels in hindsight. Alex Hirsch’s paranormal comedy show about 12-year-old twins Dipper and Mabel, who solve supernatural mysteries in their great-uncle’s home in rural Oregon, is the perfect entry point for young horror-loving audiences. It’s a pastiche of The X-Files, Twin Peaks, and Adventure Time all rolled into one, with the freewheeling, funloving spirit of a summer vacation. There’s tons of fantastic episodes to choose from, but if you’re looking for an especially spooky one to get in the Halloween spirit, you can’t go wrong with “Northwest Mansion Mystery.”

A ghost has taken up residence in the mansion estate of the wealthiest family in Gravity Falls on the eve of their annual party, and Dipper has been enlisted to exorcize it. Upon arriving at the mansion, Dipper and popular girl Pacifica Northwest uncover a dark family secret that’s been buried for generations, one that threatens to not only tarnish the family’s reputation, but engulf the entire town. For a series ostensibly aimed at young children, it’s kind of wild just how scary “Northwest Mansion Mystery” gets, with taxidermy animals bleeding from their mouths, flaming skeletal lumberjacks, and hapless partygoers being petrified into screaming wooden statues. It’s a blast, and a solid stand-alone episode to introduce new audiences to the all the spooky (and “spoopy”) delights Gravity Falls has to offer. —TE

Oct. 9: The Scooby-Doo Project

Where to watch: YouTube

Scooby-Doo got extremely dark for a few years in the early 2000s, which also happened to be the best years of the series since its heyday in the 1970s. But while movies like The Witch’s Ghost and Zombie Island are absolutely excellent (and still hold up), among the most interesting hidden gems of the series is The Scooby-Doo Project.

Like its name implies, this was a parody of The Blair Witch Project that stars the Mystery Inc. gang. Scooby, Shaggy, Fred, Velma, and Daphne set off in the Mystery Machine to the remote woods of Casper County. The movie is filmed in the same documentary style that The Blair Witch Project made iconic, and mostly inserts the gang into live-action locations like real woods or a real town where they interview locals.

The project was originally created as a bumper to bookend segments of a 1999 Scooby-Doo marathon (just a few months after the movie it was based on was released), but after Cartoon Network saw what the creators put together, it wisely decided to re-air the short segments end-to-end as a movie.

The Scooby-Doo Project not only stands alongside the original Blair Witch as an impressive and loving parody, but also as a similarly unnerving found-footage horror movie. The gang standing around among live-action backgrounds is creepy enough on its own, but hearing the beloved characters be accosted by unseen forces as they sprint through the woods is downright scary — particularly if you were a kid watching this for the first time in 1999, well before you saw The Blair Witch Project.

But the best part of The Scooby-Doo Project comes at the end when, much like the other Scooby-Doo movies of the time, we get a soft implication that the supernatural elements of the story were actually real and the horrors won’t stop when the villain’s mask comes off. It’s a downright haunting ending, and manages to match the excellence of its source material, which is high praise for any horror movie, let alone a Scooby-Doo parody. —AG

Oct. 10: Saloum

Where to watch: Shudder, AMC Plus

One of the best movies of 2022 was this criminally underseen Senegalese thriller. Saloum follows three extremely cool mercenaries whose post-mission flight home gets interrupted. The trio find themselves in a mysterious village where something is off, and the tension slowly ramps up into a chaotic finale.

The trio of lead actors are absolutely magnetic — Yann Gael (1899), Roger Sallah, and the late Mentor Ba bring the trio of loyal friends who also happen to be extremely deadly professionals fully to life. And with fantastic costume design, a stirring score, and compelling images from award-winning music video director Jean Luc Herbulot, Saloum is 84 minutes of genre-bending excellence.

Saloum first premiered at the 2021 Toronto International Film Festival, and the movie went on to win awards at Fantastic Fest and the Vancouver International Film Festival. And yet, way too few people have seen it. This is your chance to correct the record and help make Saloum the cult classic it deserves to be. —PV

Oct. 11: Heck

Where to watch: YouTube

Skinamarink has proven to be one of the most polarizing horror releases of 2023. Kyle Edward Ball’s feature debut about two children trapped alone inside their home by a malevolent entity eschews the formal conventions of traditional cinematography and plot, consisting instead of a series of canted-angle shots of dark hallways and yawning darkness that forces the audience to ruminate on the horrors that lay therein. Personally, I vibed with it heavily, and so it should come as no surprise that I quite enjoyed Ball’s 2020 short film Heck as well.

Conceived as a “proof of concept” for Skinamarink, the short is told from the perspective of a young child who wakes in the dead of night to the blaring sound of their mother’s television set. With their mother seemingly nowhere to be found, the child is left to their own devices, with no means of either leaving the house or calling for help. As the interminable night drags on, with hours morphing into days morphing into weeks morphing into months of penumbral isolation, the child grows more fearful and feral, resorting to increasingly more desperate acts of disobedience in hopes of rousing their mother from sleep. This effort, however, is ultimately proven to be in vain.

Heck circles the same rough ideas and themes of Skinamarink to different effect, channeling the vulnerability of a child and the horror of abandonment and neglect to create an experimental horror experience that demands the audience’s full attention. It’s a fascinating companion to Skinamarink that shows just how far Ball has come as a director honing in on this particular strain of horror, and makes it all the more intriguing to speculate on what he might conjure up next. —TE

Oct. 12: Harper’s Island

Where to watch: Available to purchase on Amazon, Apple, and Vudu

In theory, slasher TV should be easier to pull off. Episodic structure lends itself well to a slowly dwindling cast, with a killer on the loose and a different death each episode. This, as Lizzie McGuire (as Isabella the pop star) says, is what dreams are made of. And yet, show after show flubs it, because they can’t find interesting enough characters or dilemmas in what should be an endlessly engaging premise.

But the rules are different on Harper’s Island.

The small Pacific Northwest island was home to a serial killing where Abby (Elaine Cassidy) lost her mom almost a decade ago. She only returns at the start of the series under the most extreme of circumstances: her best friend Henry’s (Christopher Gorham) wedding. And unfortunately, the island’s deadly legacy is about to get a whole lot worse.

The thing is: The show is a perfect low-rent masterpiece. Being from 2009, it feels like a time capsule for both bootcut jeans and miniseries. At a tight 13 episodes, Harper’s Island knows what it’s about (killing people) and gets right to it (brutally). And yet, the beauty of Harper’s Island and its antics is how long it’s able to sustain a levelheaded approach to a purely absurd And Then There Were None scenario, right down to how long nobody knows they’re being picked off. Almost no death is like the last, which seems purely impractical from a serial killing perspective but makes for great TV. The episode titles are the onomatopoeias for how people die, for Christ’s sake! It’s all very fun and twisty, as bodies and mystery continue to mount. Harper’s Island makes slasher TV look fun and easy. More TV should be like Harper’s Island. —Zosha Millman

Oct. 13: American Horror Story: NYC

Where to watch: Hulu

I have already gone on record about how I cannot look away from the trash fire that is most seasons of American Horror Story. But last season really solidified the reason I even watched the show in the first place. Namely, when AHS is good, it’s really good.

AHS: NYC opens up with a serial killer on the prowl. That, coupled with the leather-clad spectral figure that seems to be haunting the main characters, seems like it’s just typical AHS schlock. But it’s so much more than that. Yes, there is a serial killer who uncannily resembles Jeffrey Dahmer, and the scenes where he stalks and tortures his victims are pretty scary. And yes, there is a leather daddy ghost that has no name or face. And yes, there’s a lot of dubiously consensual BDSM scenes. But the real horror comes from the powerlessness of the queer community in the face of the AIDS crisis.

Creator Ryan Murphy builds this overwhelming, inescapable sense of dread. All AHS seasons hinge on their titular premise, which, more often than not, is a location. It’s not always done effectively, but in NYC, Murphy and the writers heighten the foreboding terror of being alone in a city of millions, of feeling helpless in a crowded room, of knowing that there’s something out to get you but not being able to do anything about that.

The whole season is surprisingly subdued for AHS (yes, even with the sex cages), and it builds up to a painfully poignant finale scene where, for 10 minutes set to Kraftwerk’s “Radioactivity,” one of the main characters wordlessly trudges through the next 10 years of his life, watching everyone around him slowly succumb to AIDS, as horror and reality blend together. —Petrana Radulovic

Oct. 14: Cat People

Where to watch: Max

Want to be a smarter horror fan this October? Watch the movie that originated the modern jump scare, and then impress people at Halloween parties with this knowledge.

Cat People is not only a key part of horror movie history, it’s a delightfully dark and sexy time positively radiating with atmosphere. The movie follows a woman (Simone Simon) who is caught between her desire for a new man in her life (Kent Smith) and her belief that she is cursed to turn into a panther if she becomes aroused. And at 73 minutes, it’s one of the shorter horror classics you can watch this fall.

Now for that jump scare origin. There’s a tense sequence in this movie where one character stalks another. Director Jacques Tourneur lets the tension build to an unbearable level before surprising the audience with the sudden appearance of a bus. Often considered the first example of the modern jump scare, it was called the “Lewton Bus” after producer Val Lewton, who used the technique again in later movies. —PV

Oct. 15: The Neon Demon

Where to watch: Prime Video, Hoopla, Freevee

Modeling is a cutthroat industry, and that goes double in Drive director Nicolas Winding Refn’s 2016 horror movie The Neon Demon.

The movie follows Elle Fanning as Jesse, a young model who just moved to Los Angeles and quickly gets taken under the wing of makeup artist Ruby (Jena Malone). As Jesse becomes more successful as a model, she meets various members of the industry who are willing to part the seas for her even as she makes enemies who get caught up in a wake she unknowingly creates. Even when people are being nice to her, no one lets Jesse pass without making it clear they’re jealous of her beauty and curious about what she can give them… or that they can take from her.

Here, like in Drive, Refn’s version of LA is soaked in dread and seediness in every corner. Every person reads like a threat, and every new competitor or friend seems to be looking for a new way to drain the life out of the people around them — until they finally actually do it. But, like all Refn projects, what really sets The Neon Demon apart is how it looks. The griminess of the movie’s world turns brightly lit photo shoots into shadow-filled nightmares, with people who stalk the sets like jungle predators.

Though The Neon Demon didn’t get the same acclaim as other so-called elevated horror movies from the time, looking back, it fits perfectly among the ranks of The Witch, It Follows, and Under the Skin. Refn’s nightmarish modeling movie is dripping with cynicism, cruelty, and a creeping atmosphere, with more meanness than almost any other movie from the era could muster. But it’s all in the pursuit of beauty, of course. —AG

Oct. 16: Project Wolf Hunting

Where to watch: Hi-Yah!; available to rent on Amazon, Apple, and Vudu

Sometimes, what you’re looking for is just literal tons of blood and gore. And when that’s contained in a premise that’s essentially “Con Air meets Predator, with a bit of The Last Voyage of the Demeter,” that’s hard to beat.

Project Wolf Hunting is a Korean monster mash built out of an extremely fun idea. “What if a bunch of dangerous criminals rebelled on the cargo ship they were being transported on, only to discover the ship is also transporting a monster?”

The story is necessarily light, and the characters are thinly drawn (although the effective costuming and makeup work go a long way), but that’s not what you’re here for if you’re watching Project Wolf Hunting. You’re here for gory violence, and boy, is there a lot of it. The director has bragged that the team used 2.5 tons of fake blood while filming the movie, and it certainly shows. It’s one of the goriest movies I’ve ever seen, and that gore is augmented by terrific sound design, which builds the monster up into something well beyond the realm of humankind by making its movements sound metallic. It’s a machine designed for killing, and Project Wolf Hunting is a movie designed for a bloody good time. —PV

Oct. 17: Kuroneko

Where to watch: Criterion Channel, Max

Like his 1964 film Onibaba (which we featured in our 2021 Halloween countdown), Kaneto Shindo’s 1968 supernatural horror film is a cerebral, gorgeous, and eerie drama set amid the tumultuous Sengoku period of Japanese history.

Kuroneko centers on the story of two women, a mother and her daughter-in-law, who are raped and murdered by a wandering band of samurai who set fire to their family home. Haunted by vengeance, their spirits forge a pact with the demons of the underworld, resurrecting them in exchange for the death of any samurai unfortunate enough to cross their paths. As the death toll rises, a young samurai is enlisted to fend off the wayward spirits once and for all, unaware of either the origins behind their malice or their tragic connection to his own past.

Kiyomi Kuroda’s cinematography in Kuroneko is a master class in minimalism, employing an intense contrast of light and shadow to produce sequences that feel downright otherworldly to behold. Whether it’s scenes of samurai wandering through a void of darkness by the Rajōmon gates or a dreamlike pan through a bamboo thicket overlaid as a character ruminates over the past, the film is a gorgeous display of deft cinematic craftsmanship in service of telling a dramatic and terrifying story of love, revenge, and regret. —TE

Oct. 18: A Wounded Fawn

Where to watch: Shudder, AMC Plus

One of 2022’s best under-the-radar horror movies takes its inspiration from an old-fashioned source: Greek mythology.

Director Travis Stevens (Jakob’s Wife) melds Greek mythic imagery with an unconventional serial killer narrative in a thrilling combination that breathes new life into the genre. The movie follows a museum curator who goes on a date with a serial killer. She finds him out once she notices a statue, The Wrath of Erinyes, that is in his home but shouldn’t be. From there, things get really strange.

Shot on 35mm, A Wounded Fawn is a gorgeous movie to behold, even before the action truly starts. Once it does, be prepared for a descent into the phantasmagoric, with jaw-dropping visuals, eerie practical effects, and a heavy dose of Aeschylus’ Eumenides.

With fantastic performances from Sarah Lind (Jakob’s Wife) and Dropout veteran Josh Ruben (Werewolves Within) in an unsettlingly off-type role, A Wounded Fawn is a bold new entry into the serial killer movie canon. —PV

Oct. 19: The Hole in the Ground

Where to watch: Max

Few horror tropes get as much mileage as the image of the unnatural child. Likely that’s because the idea that kids should be innocent and cheerful is baked into so many human cultures that a child acting spooky and inhuman is a terrific cross-cultural recipe for horror. But an effective creepy-kid movie requires a spectacular creepy kid performer. James Quinn Markey fully delivers in The Hole in the Ground, the debut feature of Evil Dead Rise director Lee Cronin. But the movie isn’t just about a scary child — it’s about all the psychological baggage involved in dealing with one.

Seána Kerslake stars as Sarah, a woman recently moved to the Irish countryside with her young son, Chris (Markey). After an unnerving incident, she starts to believe Chris has been replaced by an inhuman doppelgänger. There’s plenty of evidence that it’s true, at least for the audience. But an erratic, violent local woman who also believes her son was replaced serves as a warning for Sarah, both about how she can expect the community to dismiss her anxieties, and more potently, as a dark mirror of her fears, a suggestion that she might just be losing her mind. This incredibly dark and squirmy movie is much quieter and more internal than Evil Dead Rise, but it sure puts the screws to the audience, especially as it builds to an unforgettable, horrifying climax. —TR

Oct. 20: Silent Hill

Where to watch: Peacock

The mid-2000s were a no man’s land for horror movies. By 2006, we were four years out from the blockbuster prestige of Gore Verbinski’s The Ring and the J-horror import boom that followed it in America, and only just beginning to transition into the Saw-dominated years of “realistic” horror. More importantly, we were still almost a decade away from the arthouse horror boom that would kick off closer to 2014 with films like It Follows. This was exactly the environment Silent Hill was released into, and it deserved so much better.

The movie follows Rose, whose daughter, Sharon, is plagued with awful episodes of sleepwalking and nightmares about the mysterious abandoned town of Silent Hill. Rose brings Sharon to the town in a last-ditch attempt to find answers, but things go horribly wrong when the fog-shrouded town seems to transport them (along with police officer Cybil Bennett) to a new monstrous dimension. Meanwhile, after the mother and daughter have been gone for a few hours, Rose’s husband, Christopher, sets off to Silent Hill to find his family.

Inside the town is where Silent Hill takes the most inspiration from the video game series it’s based on. Some of Silent Hill’s most recognizable enemies and monsters show up, chasing Cybil, Sharon, and Rose through the town and eventually into the iconic Pyramid Head. These segments are impressively scary, and steeped in the dreadful atmosphere that made the games famous.

But even beyond the terrifying town itself, the best part of Silent Hill comes when Christopher arrives. Rather than managing to find his family, all he finds is an abandoned mining town. For most of the movie, the women’s frantic running and hiding from monsters is paralleled by Christopher wandering around the exact same areas, filled with a dreadful sense that his family is close, but completely unable to see them or the horrors threatening to kill them. It’s not a subtle metaphor for the differences in the ways that men and women go through the world, but it is an effective one, and it manages to create a level of crushing existential terror and defeat that few movies ever come close to. —AG

Oct. 21: Suspiria (2018)

Where to watch: Prime Video, Freevee

Dario Argento’s 1977 Suspiria is a horror masterpiece, the sort of film even the best directors would face insurmountable odds of matching with a remake. The story — an American ballerina who moves to Germany to attend a prestigious ballet company, only to be greeted by a series of murders and a supernatural mystery — is a vessel for Argento’s craft, featuring some of his boldest visuals and some truly nauseating body horror.

So how, then, did Luca Guadagnino do the impossible, creating its contemporary equal?

He cast Tilda Swinton in multiple roles and Mia Goth to do the Mia Goth thing. For cinematography, he brought on Sayombhu Mukdeeprom, known for Guadagnino’s own Call Me By Your Name, but also Apichatpong Weerasethakul’s seminal indie films Uncle Boonmee Who Can Recall His Past Lives and Memoria. And for the score: Thom Yorke. Yes, Radiohead Thom Yorke.

Where other directors would have obsessively recreated a source text, rebooting it into something unrecognizable, Guadagnino’s film is an homage — the sort of movie you imagine Argento would make with the budgets and creative freedom afforded by tech companies trying to buy cultural capital. It’s more political. More grotesque. The ending is just more.

The truth is 2018’s Suspiria and the original Suspiria should be enjoyed together. In the past, that’s been a challenge, with the original film being surprisingly difficult to watch — especially if you prefer streaming. But this month, Criterion Collection has you covered, allowing for one of the most batshit double features of your life. —CP

Oct. 22: Pan’s Labyrinth

Where to watch: Available to purchase on Amazon, Apple, and Vudu

Not just a great horror movie, but one of the Great Movies, Pan’s Labyrinth is among the best examples of a fairy tale for adults. Set during the aftermath of the Spanish Civil War, Pan’s Labyrinth follows Ofelia (Ivana Baquero) after her pregnant mother takes her to live with her new stepfather, Captain Vidal (Sergi López) — a fascist Falangista hunting down the republican rebels that are hiding out in the Spanish forest.

In this terrifying time, Ofelia encounters a faun, a mythical creature that claims she is the reincarnated Princess Moanna, daughter of the king of the underworld. The Faun (Doug Jones) tells her that if she completes three tasks, she can return to the king and queen and live forever as princess of the underworld.

Like many folk tales before they’re sterilized by pop culture, Pan’s Labyrinth is a fairy tale full of menace, danger, and horror — but also hope. It is both a refuge from a turbulent time and an attempt to understand it, a parable that becomes timeless in its specificity with new meaning to discover every time it’s revisited. Widely considered to be writer-director Guillermo del Toro’s magnum opus, it shows the director operating at the peak of his powers, with lavish production design, evocative colors, and naturalistic performances juxtaposed with quiet, dangerous magic.

But what makes it a great film is astonishingly simple. Some movies endeavor to make sure you understand them. The best ones help you understand yourself. Pan’s Labyrinth, in the end, wants to know what kind of person you are by the time the credits roll. —Joshua Rivera

Oct. 23: Eyes Without a Face

Where to watch: Criterion Channel, Max

The late 1950s weren’t exactly a booming era for French horror films. While Henri-Georges Clouzot’s psychological thriller Diabolique received an effusive reception upon its release in 1955, the prevailing attitude of French critics at the time was that horror was antithetical to the high-minded standard of what French cinema should aspire to. Eyes Without a Face bucked against this perception, taking what would otherwise be a standard mad scientist tale and turning it into a dark horror fable about love, guilt, and madness.

The film follows Dr. Génessier, a renowned plastic surgeon wracked with guilt over a car accident that disfigured his beloved daughter Christiane’s face. Faking her death and confining her to the grounds of his mansion, Génessier devises a desperate and horrifying scheme: Perform a series of skin grafts to repair Christiane’s face using the faces of abducted women who resemble her. With the failure of each attempt, the body count begins to rise, prompting the authorities to mount a desperate manhunt to apprehend the culprit. In the midst of all of this, Christiane herself grows tired of her father’s obsession, wishing instead to reunite with her lover Jacques and resume her life.

Fantastical and atmospheric, Eyes Without a Face is a beautiful horror thriller with masterful cinematography courtesy of Eugen Schüfftan (who previously worked on Fritz Lang’s Metropolis) and a memorable score composed by Maurice-Alexis Jarre, who would later go on to win an Academy Award for his work on Lawrence of Arabia. If you’re looking for an intelligent and gorgeous horror movie that still manages to dabble in its share of gore, Georges Franju’s masterpiece is a must-watch. —TE

Oct. 24: Overlord

Where to watch: Paramount Plus, Pluto TV

This slept-on genre-mashing gem takes a cast of excellent actors about to do bigger things (Jovan Adepo, Wyatt Russell, John Magaro, Pilou Asbæk, and more), and an up-and-coming director (The Pope’s Exorcist’s Julius Avery) and places them behind Nazi lines during World War II. The Nazis are up to more than usual this time: There be zombies in these labs.

On the eve of D-Day, a group of Allied paratroopers are sent into Germany on a covert mission. Things go wrong instantly when their plane crashes, and they soon discover twisted Nazi experiments after connecting with the residents. Things get bloody fast, with great action from second unit director Shaun O’Dell (The Woman King, Brotherhood of the Wolf) and stunt coordinator Jo McLaren (Heart of Stone).

Overlord is a gleeful, intentionally ridiculous Nazi-zombie-bashing time, with tight direction and a fantastic group of actors. If you love the Wolfenstein games or Call of Duty’s Zombies mode, or B-movies with A-movie production, this one is for you. —PV

Oct. 25: Curve

Where to watch: YouTube

Tim Egan’s 2016 horror short inspires the same visceral physical response as watching an episode of Squid Game. A young woman wakes to discover her twisted body perched precariously on the slope of a strange cliff overlooking a bottomless pit. Her hands caked with blood, the woman attempts to inch herself away from the pit, each desperate motion teetering on the cusp of survival and oblivion. Will she be able to escape where so many others have failed?

Curve works as a horror short because it leaves so much to the imagination. We don’t know who this woman is, how she ended up in this situation, or what the purpose of this place even is. In the presence of imminent horror, our first instinct is to scramble for answers and, in the absence of any to be found, our second instinct is to search for a means of escape. Through a captivating lead performance and deft sound design, Egan delivers a gripping horror story in just under 10 minutes. —TE

Oct. 26: The Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2

Where to watch: Max

The Texas Chain Saw Massacre is a nauseating smoothie of rural horror, outré indie experimentation, and wannabe snuff film. Its murders aren’t real, but you’d be forgiven for being convinced the film’s actors are in genuine trouble; from the budget film stock to the filthy sets, it all feels… off. The result is not just a great horror flick, but a monumental work that originated many tropes of its genre and, most recently, earned a coveted spot in the Sight and Sound list of the greatest films of all time.

The Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2 is nothing like that. You won’t see its name in a film school syllabus, and the films it inspired can be counted on one hand. Nonetheless, there’s something commendable about the gall of Tobe Hooper, the original Texas Chain Saw director, returning to his series with the energy of a middle-aged man on his first ayahuasca retreat.

Leatherface gets in a high-speed car battle, eventually standing on the roof of a speeding sedan. Dennis Hopper dual-wields chainsaws. A radio station office is obliterated like it’s a novelty rage room. Sometimes you want a steak, and sometimes you want a hamburger. Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2 is a damn juicy burger. —CP

Oct. 27: Possessor

Where to watch: Hulu

My first Brandon Cronenberg (yes, David’s son) movie was Infinity Pool, his latest messed-up meditation on the rich and powerful. I vividly remember telling friends how exciting and debauched the movie was, and their response surprised me: “Clearly you haven’t seen Possessor.”

That night, I rectified this, and dear readers: They were right. As disturbing and mystifying as I found the world of Infinity Pool, Possessor was all that and more. And I haven’t been able to get it out of my brain since. Which is… fitting, considering the movie.

Andrea Riseborough (Mandy, To Leslie) plays an elite corporate assassin who is able to inhabit other people’s bodies, getting closer to her victims by posing as people already in their lives. It’s a haunting premise, and one Possessor takes full advantage of, both in the moments of action and in the assassin’s contemplation about what her identity truly even is.

Possessor is an unforgettable entry into the psychological horror canon, and it brings a little sci-fi into your Halloween celebrations. Don’t miss it. —PV

Oct. 28: Opera

Where to watch: Shudder, Tubi, Vudu

You can’t get more than five minutes into a conversation about Italian horror without mentioning Dario Argento, the giallo master.

Opera represents the last hurrah of Argento’s hot streak throughout the ’70s and ’80s. It’s an extravagant horror-thriller that combines high-minded aesthetics with the viscerality of slasher cinema. The film follows Betty, the understudy to a famous opera singer, who is selected to play the role of Lady Macbeth after the star suffers a terrible accident. While preparing for her first big performance, Betty is subjected to a terrifying ordeal when she is attacked by a mysterious unseen assailant who tapes needles under her eyes and forces her to watch as her boyfriend is mutilated. Barely escaping with her life, Betty seeks the aid of Marco, the play’s director, in apprehending the culprit before they can claim another victim.

Very loosely based on Argento’s own experience directing a failed production of Verdi’s Macbeth, Opera is a sumptuous and suspenseful slasher that holds the viewer’s attention and absolutely refuses to let go. Like Betty, one feels compelled to watch this macabre display of ritualistic horror play out to its conclusion in a desperate search of answers. Fortunately, unlike Betty, you won’t have to worry about losing your eyes if you find yourself overwhelmed by the frights. —TE

Oct. 29: House of 1000 Corpses

Where to watch: AMC Plus, Pluto TV, Tubi

House of 1000 Corpses may be the true answer to the question “What is the best The Texas Chain Saw Massacre sequel?”

The movie follows a group of teens who are putting together a book on roadside attractions when they stumble upon a serial killer-themed rest stop run by a weirdo. After their strange encounter, the kids set off on the road, only for their car to break down a few miles later. Thankfully, their helpful hitchhiker companion Baby knows just the place they can get help: the Firefly mansion, where her family lives. From there, things devolve into a host of horrific stage plays, cursed experiments, and gruesome murders.

The family at its center, whom Rob Zombie went on to make two more movies about, is repulsive and absolutely horrible, but still zany enough to be truly unsettling in a way that few horror movies can be. House of 1000 Corpses is a grisly, grotesque film that captures all the grime of the ’70s movies that inspired it. But what really makes it worth watching is the way it balances silliness and terror, doling each out in proportional quantities until you can’t figure out if you should laugh or scream. Instead, you just end up doing both. —AG

Oct. 30: Thirst

Where to watch: Peacock

Park Chan-wook has never missed. And Thirst, his most overt foray into horror, may also be his steamiest movie (a high bar, considering the excellent The Handmaiden).

Frequent Park collaborator Song Kang-ho stars as a Catholic priest who volunteers for a medical experiment. The experiment instead turns him into a vampire, giving him a lust for blood… and also for the wife of an old friend.

In many ways, this movie is in close relationship to his two most recent releases — The Handmaiden and Decision to Leave. It pairs the eroticism of the former with the charged relationship dynamic of the latter, to gripping effect. With Park’s typical attention to detail and eye for arresting images (as well as his wicked sense of humor), Thirst is an unconventional and sexy Halloween watch. —PV

Oct. 31: The Exorcist III

Where to watch: Prime Video, Criterion Channel

Nearly 50 years since it was first released in theaters, William Friedkin’s The Exorcist has withstood the test of time as one of the most terrifying and influential horror films in American cinema. The sequel that came closest to capturing that same lightning in a bottle is The Exorcist III, written and directed by William Peter Blatty, the original screenwriter of the first film and author of the novel on which it was based.

When a series of gruesome murders matching the modus operandi of an infamous serial killer begins to terrorize the city of Georgetown, Lt. William F. Kinderman (George C. Scott) investigates the psych ward of a local hospital in search of leads. Confronted with a suspect whose appearance matches that of his late friend Father Damien Karras, Kinderman finds himself thrust into a battle for his very soul as he confronts an evil beyond his comprehension.

The story of The Exorcist III’s production is a tangled mess of false starts, studio interference, and thwarted artistic ambitions. Though it was originally conceived with Friedkin in mind to return as director, he eventually left the project due to creative differences with Blatty. John Carpenter was at one time tapped to direct, before he too stepped aside to allow Blatty himself to take the reins. Morgan Creek Productions, which financed the film, demanded Blatty reshoot the film’s final act, which originally ended without an exorcism. Even given these complications, The Exorcist III remains a fascinating and terrifying film in its own right, with a hodgepodge of fascinating creative choices and literary dialogue that makes the film feel like a sister piece to Blatty’s The Ninth Configuration. It may not have been the Exorcist sequel that audiences at the time wanted, but it’s still a damn fine picture. —TE",The Halloween Countdown: 31 days of horror to watch,https://www.polygon.com/what-to-watch/23893288/best-halloween-horror-movies-tv-watch-stream,Polygon

Got it Normal text size Larger text size Very large text size Tyler Mitchell was just 23 when he became the first black photographer to shoot the cover of American Vogue. His subject was Beyoncé, and his dreamy, delicately hued portraits spoke of a precocious visual talent. In the five years since, he has exhibited around the world, become an Instagram darling, with more than 500,00 followers, and shot what would become the most controversial vice-presidential portrait in living memory. When Mitchell’s portrait of Kamala Harris dressed in sneakers and casual clothing was chosen for the cover of Vogue for February 2021, the social media backlash was swift. Critics questioned why his alternative image – in which Harris looked more, well, vice-presidential – hadn’t been used instead. Bowing to the outrage over the perceived lack of respect shown to the first woman to reach such high office, the magazine later issued a limited edition using the more formal shot. The controversy did little to dent the New York-based photographer’s reputation as a rising star of the medium and this month, three of his works can be seen in the NGV’s Triennial exhibition. The first, Picnic, depicts a family gathering: young men throw a football, and a child is lifted on shoulders. There are wicker baskets and a thermos, and in the background, a darkened wood that perhaps hints at the fragility of a moment so peaceful and pure. Tyler Mitchell, Picnic. 2021 (detail). Credit: Courtesy of the artist and Jack Shainman Gallery, New York In the other works, his figures are arranged across a sandy expanse in idealised depictions of black American leisure. In Albany, Georgia, a football flies through the air, a father in dress shirt and tails twirls a child, and a young boy rides a toy truck. Vastness focuses on a teenage boy who stands patiently as his younger siblings stretch his wildly elongated sleeves out beside him; nearby, a dog sits listening to a violinist. These carefully staged set-ups are evidence of Mitchell’s desire to establish a new visual narrative for black Americans.

“I think that I am part of a longer lineage of black artists who have considered how they respond to the Western historical art canon, but also it’s 2023, and it’s a new day and I think beyond just responding to that canon, we’re trying to use the limited language of pictures to try and imagine what personal and unencumbered freedom looks like for young black men and women today,” he tells me when we chat in New York in the lead-up to the Triennial. Loading In one of his favourite works, A Glint of Possibility, a teenage boy hangs over a river suspended on a tyre swing, studying his own reflection. The moment is pensive and peaceful at once, and relatable to anyone who’s ever been a child on a tyre swing on a hot summer day. Something about it speaks to the turmoil and tension inherent in the experience of black American teenage boys, about the ways their lives can be complicated by the world we all inhabit. How even when doing unremarkable things – walking home, playing in the park, talking to their crush – their lives can be destroyed or irrevocably altered. Mitchell understands the significance of these contrasts. His work exists in the tension between what is possible and how things are. He describes it as: “A consideration of joy, perseverance and self-determination against the backdrop of history.” Tyler Mitchell: “I’ve never been to Australia so it’s very exciting to sort of have a global or new conversation on a new continent with my work.″⁣ Credit: Courtesy of the artist and Jack Shainman Gallery, New York The theme of the Triennial is “Magic, Matter, Memory”, making Mitchell’s pieces a logical inclusion. “A lot of my work meditates on being between a heightened reality, or potentially even a magical reality and an actual reality,” he says.

“I’m creating what I call lightly staged moments. And so that means I’m setting up scenarios where these families are enjoying real moments of leisure in outdoor spaces, usually open pastures and fields, and those moments are meant to stand in for a meditation on what it means to enjoy leisurely outdoor nature as a black person.” Tyler Mitchell, Vastness, 2021. Credit: Courtesy of the artist and Jack Shainman Gallery, New York In the listless anxious days of the pandemic, as the Black Lives Matter movement rose in the summer of 2020, and the conversation of what black life looked like was being routinely debated in the press, black artists and activists looked to reframe that conversation, and force new perspectives of peace, luxury, and safety into the picture. Instead of seeking to record things as they are, Mitchell’s work asks us to imagine new realities. He says he wants to challenge “visual regimes”: assumptions about certain people or cultures that are reinforced over and over again. “I think that [photojournalism] is a well from which we all culturally – consciously or unconsciously – construct ideas of how people live around the world,” he says. “My work is really about responding to, and questioning, and challenging those ideas.” Tyler Mitchell Albany, Georgia, 2021 (detail). Credit: Courtesy of the artist and Jack Shainman Gallery, New York As a 20-year-old film student at New York University, Mitchell became enamoured with still photography after he signed up to do a documentary photography course in Havana, Cuba. Frustrated by the amount of time and money required to make films, he was drawn to the accessibility of still photography.

“I was impatient when I got started and just wanted to make visual things now, and I didn’t want to wait for permission, or didn’t want to wait on equipment, or didn’t want to lug large amounts of equipment up flights of stairs. I just wanted to make something that I felt compelled by, immediately,” he says. His career has only blossomed in the years since he took that trip, and while some artists might feel trepidation at the attainment of so much success from such an early age, Mitchell is clear-eyed. “The idea of the road ahead only excites me,” he says. “The idea that there will be very quiet, sleepy periods, and frenetic periods, or hyperactive periods … It’s always refreshing as a young person to see how the career of a much older, more senior artist has really gone. “That senior artist that we know and love today had decades where they were out of style, out of fashion, people thought their work was done, their best work was behind them, and yet, often had resurgences. Loading “I think when we’re thinking about crafting a career … we’re really talking about allowing space for bad and good, allowing space for artists to make and work through complicated and sometimes not-so-favourable ideas. And I try to give myself that same space. It’s only about giving yourself grace and space and thinking one day at a time.” Asked if there’s a dream project, or a dream collaborator for him, Mitchell says there are too many. But with one monograph (2020’s I Can Make You Feel Good) under his belt, he’s hungry to make more.

Travis Kelce’s previous comments about having children have sparked controversy amid his ongoing romance with Taylor Swift.

The Kansas City Chiefs player, 34, first made the remarks about starting his own family during a February 2023 episode of his and his brother Jason Kelce’s podcast, New Heights. The episode resurfaced after a source claimed to Yahoo Entertainment that Swift and Travis Kelce “have talked about kids” within the next year.

In the episode of his podcast, the Philadelphia Eagles star asked his mother, Donna, which of her two sons she was “rooting for,” as the Eagles and Chiefs were preparing to play against each other in the Super Bowl at the time.

“You’ve said in the past to both of us that you root for me because I’ve given you grandkids,” Jason, who shares three children – Wyatt, four, Elliotte, two, and Bennett, seven months – with wife Kylie Kelce, said. “I’ve always known that you root for Travis. So who do you actually root for?”

After Jason asked his mother again who she was rooting for, “if in a battle to the death,” Donna responded by asking who he’d pick to save if she and her husband, Ed Kelce, were stranded in the middle of the ocean. While Donna said she couldn’t pick which of her sons to root against, Jason then joked: “Remember if you choose me, Wyatt and Elliotte grow up without a father.”

Travis then chimed in to joke about wanting to start his own family. “I gotta start breeding,” he said. “I’ve gotta start breeding, to all the breeders out there.”

Jason then responded to his brother’s remark with: “Please don’t,” before Donna advised: “Wait until you find the right person. Find the right person.”

However, Travis still doubled down on his plan, as he quipped: “I’m gonna find a breeder, and I’m gonna get kids so that mom can love me again.”

On X, formerly known as Twitter, fans have called Travis out for his seemingly sexist remarks and claimed that he shouldn’t have been referring to women as “breeders”.

“Forever grateful that Joe Alwyn kept to himself and is private,” one wrote, referring to Swift’s ex-boyfriend of six years.“It’s what makes Travis Kelce’s statements from earlier this year about ‘finding a breeder’ cringe. You are free to say what you want but are not free from the consequences of doing so. Women are not objects.”

“‘Start breeding,’ oh this is just f***ing disgusting and it’s setting us back so much,” another added. “Women aren’t baby-making machines, women are more than the man they’re dating, we are more than marriage.”

“Ain’t a Swiftie but don’t have to be one to be weirded out about Travis Kelce calling women ‘breeders,’” someone else wrote. “That ain’t it dude.”

Many other people went on to criticise claims about Swift and Travis having children soon, since the singer is about to return to her Eras Tour until November 2024.

“Well I know for DAMN SURE that s*** about ‘having kids within the next year’ is NOT coming from Taylor’s side,” one claimed. “She’s got the Eras Tour booked all through next year, and she’d rather die than cancel a show. But we do know who’s been public about looking for a ‘BREEDER.’”

The comments about Travis and Swift’s romance came days after they seemingly confirmed their relationship. On 22 October, Swift made her return to Arrowhead Stadium to watch as the Kansas City Chiefs won their game against the Los Angeles Chargers. The occasion marked Swift’s fourth time attending one of Kelce’s games, amid ongoing reports that they are dating.

Following the event, Chariah Gordon, the partner of Kelce’s teammate Mecole Hardman Jr, took to Instagram to share a snap of the singer and NFL player’s sweet PDA moment. In the picture, Swift could be seen standing next to Kelce, reaching to kiss his cheek.

In addition to the kiss, the football star also had the perfect reaction to a fan calling him Swift’s boyfriend. After a fan shouted: “Let’s go Taylor’s boyfriend” while Kelce was waiting for an elevator, he responded with a small smile on his face and by pumping his fist into the air.

Aside from their appearances at sports events, Swift and Kelce have also been photographed together on other occasions, including a date earlier this month in New York City after their surprise appearances on the season 49 premiere of Saturday Night Live. At the time, sources alleged to Entertainment Tonight that, during the date, Kelce got a little too close to Swift’s security personnel and allegedly told her bodyguard to step aside.

However, during an episode of his podcast, Kelce explained what he said to the security, and clarified that he didn’t push the bodyguard. “I placed my hand on the gentleman’s back to let him know I was behind him. If I would have pushed him, he probably would have turned around and tased me,” he said.

entertainment,,2023-10-10T08:00:40+00:00,"Hollywood is a tough place to raise kids, prompting some celebrities to take a tough-love approach to parenting.

Stars like Arnold Schwarzenegger, who admitted to being like a ""drill instructor"" when his kids were young, and Reese Witherspoon, who recently said she wants kids to deal with failure more directly, have shared their harsher parenting styles in interviews.

Others, like Ashton Kutcher and Mila Kunis and Kristen Bell and Dax Shepard, are focused on keeping their kids grateful for growing up in famous families with wealth and privilege at their fingertips.

Here's a look at a few celebrity parents focusing on firmer parenting.

Arnold Schwarzenegger

Arnold Schwarzenegger, who shares four children with ex-wife Maria Shriver and also shares a son with Mildred Baena, the family's former housekeeper, has a disciplined approach to parenting, recently admitting he had a ""drill instructor"" approach when his kids were young.

In a recent interview with People while promoting his new book, he recalled a moment when his eldest daughter, Katherine, brought over her 3-year-old daughter, Lyla, and saw the lesson he passed down.

""Katherine comes over with Lyla, and she says, 'Lyla, I told you already not to put the shoes there. Keep your shoes on, or you put them away, but you don't leave them there by the stand in front of the fireplace because you know what Daddy did? When I left my shoes there twice? The third time, he burned them in front of me and I cried,'"" he said.

Schwarzenegger said the story was ""absolutely"" true, and he took pride in knowing that Katherine ""uses the same methods, which she cried over, and she complained about"" with Lyla as well as her other daughter, Eloise, both of whom she shares with husband Chris Pratt.

ARNOLD SCHWARZENEGGER PRAISES DAUGHTER KATHERINE’S PARENTING, REVEALS WHY GRANDKIDS LOVE COMING TO HIS HOME

The 76-year-old also shared similar tough-love approaches with his eldest son, Patrick.

Schwarzenegger said that when he was 9, he threw his mattress outside after Patrick didn’t make the bed.

""I opened up the door to the balcony, picked up the mattress and threw it down with the bedsheets, the pillows, everything. I said, 'Don't ever make someone come in and clean your room, clean your shower or make your bed,'"" he told People. ""I said, 'Because I taught you how to make the bed.'""

He also battled over shower time with Patrick, feeling he was taking too long, and came up with a plan to limit them by installing a timer, similar to ones he’d used in Munich.

""And so when he got the shower on, and he was whistling and singing in there and thinking Daddy's not around, all the sudden the ice-cold shower came on. And all of a sudden, we heard downstairs the scream,"" Schwarzenegger said.

The former California governor also recently issued a warning that if young people are over-pampered, this nation may be ""creating a generation of wimps and weak people.""

""You can only strengthen your character and become a really strong person inside if you have resistance, if you fail, if you get up again and if you work hard,"" Schwarzenegger said on ""The Howard Stern Show.""

ARNOLD SCHWARZENEGGER'S BODYBUILDER SON IS SPITTING IMAGE OF FAMOUS DAD

Reese Witherspoon

Reese Witherspoon is a mom of three. She shares her eldest children, Ava and Deacon, with ex-husband Ryan Phillippe, and her youngest, Tennessee, with ex-husband Jim Toth.

In a recent interview on the ""Good Inside with Dr. Becky"" podcast, the Oscar-winner said she wants to see kids live with failure a little more.

""I see this a lot with parents – I don't know when we stopped letting our kids fail. Like I learned so much from the paper I didn't turn in or the demerits I got, so I got detention. I was suspended from school,"" she recalled.

She added, ""And my parents didn't say, ‘Uh, she didn't deserve that,' and take me out of school. They actually let me sit in it and feel uncomfortable. So, I think learning from failure is actually a valuable tool that you can't take away from kids, right? You rob them if you don't let them sit in the discomfort of the experience.""

REESE WITHERSPOON AND EX JIM TOTH SETTLE DIVORCE WITH KEY STIPULATION ABOUT RAISING THEIR SON

The ""Walk the Line"" star remembered comforting her daughter when she was younger after she lost a basketball game – but not shying away from the lesson.

Witherspoon recalled saying, ""'Yeah, I know. I know that probably feels really bad,'"" but then adding, ""'You know what also? Maybe you're not good at basketball?'""

Her daughter was slightly upset in the moment, but Witherspoon continued, ""It's actually really important to learn what you're not good at.""

Daniel Craig

James Bond star Daniel Craig shares one daughter with wife Rachel Weisz and has an older daughter from his previous marriage to Fiona Loudon. He is also step-dad to Weisz’s son from a previous relationship.

But Craig’s children shouldn’t expect a pile of money when he’s gone.

In an interview with Saga Magazine in 2020, Craig said, ""My philosophy is to get rid of it or give it away before you go. I don’t want to leave great sums to the next generation.""

A year later in an interview with Candis magazine, he repeated the sentiment that inheritance is ""distasteful"" and pondered the overall nature of wealth.

""Isn't there an old adage that if you die a rich person, you've failed? I think Andrew Carnegie gave away what in today's money would be about 11 billion dollars, which shows how rich he was because I'll bet he kept some of it, too,"" he said.

In a 2021 interview with Us Weekly, Prinze gave some details on how they parent their kids, now ages 13 and 11.

""We are strict as hell,"" the ""I Know What You Did Last Summer"" star told the outlet. ""Look, I don’t believe in whooping kids. I’ve never whooped mine. My mom whooped me. They were, like, preventative whooping, so I know how to be strict.""

Prinze added that Gellar also knows how to be strict and has ""100 rules"" for their kids.

""They know they can’t break [those rules],"" he said. ""Friendships come and go. I tell my kids all the time that family is forever. So, we have rules, and they’ve got to follow [them].""

Gellar told Us Weekly in 2020 that as parents their ""expectations are a little higher than most.""

""I think [our children] know what the rules are,"" she said at the time. ""We have [family dinner] as many nights as we can. We have no phones at the table. We sit, we all have dinner together.""

Ashton Kutcher and Mila Kunis

Ashton Kutcher and Mila Kunis have been married since 2015 and share two children, daughter Wyatt, 9, and son Dmitri, 6.

To help keep their kids grounded, Kunis revealed in a 2020 interview on ""The Late Show with Stephen Colbert"" how she keeps their privilege in check.

""I like to remind them that Mommy and Daddy have money, but they’re broke all the time,"" she said with a laugh. ""That is not their bedroom, it is my bedroom that I’m letting them use, so they better take good care of it.""

She continued, ""I say this in jest, but really they don’t have things … they’re raised on hand-me-downs from girlfriends’ kids’ clothing; we garden.""

Kunis noted her kids are lucky to be born into a famous family and wants to ensure they are grateful.

""Our kids are super-fortunate,"" she said. ""Regardless, they were born at the right time to the right people, and I love them, but they’re not going to be entitled a--holes.""

When her kids were teenagers, Bure spoke with L.A. Parent about her parenting style, noting that she can be ""strict.""

""I hope my kids would say that I’m a loving mom,"" Bure said. ""They would also describe me as strict. We set firm boundaries, but there is always love and grace.""

She continued, ""I’m the mom that needs to meet the parents before my kids can go to a new friend’s house. I want to know who they’re with, where they’re going. Even now that they’re driving, I want them to text me when they arrive and when they’re heading home.""

Bure explained that they ""work hard to keep our communication open and talk through any situation"" and they are ""always willing to listen.""

""But I don’t always say yes,"" she added. ""My goal as a parent is not to make my kids happy but to guide them to be respectful, curious, responsible, resilient, kind, giving and thoughtful adults.""

Kristen Bell and Dax Shepard

Kristen Bell and Dax Shepard share two daughters together, Lincoln, 10, and Delta, 8, and have been married for 10 years.

The couple has been honest about the trials and tribulations of raising their kids, especially to keep them grounded.

""It’s very important to me that they share a bedroom. I think their lives will be easier than most other people’s on the planet, and to develop a good character, it’s important to always be going through something,"" Bell told Self in 2020.

""I like the fact that they will have to figure out how to share a bedroom, figure out how to share your closet, figure out how to share your space,"" she continued. ""If that’s the worst thing about your life, that you have to share a bedroom with your sister, you’re going to be OK.""

Bell also laid out her strict screen-time rules, but she admits they get a little lax on the weekends.

""They’re not allowed to play with our phones or have any screens really. They are allowed to watch TV on the weekends, and we’re pretty liberal with it, which I’ve been considering paying more attention to,"" she said. ""But since they’re not allowed at all during the week, they will wake up at 6:30 on a Saturday morning, and they will watch TV until noon. I will also sleep until 9:45, which is really nice, and then get stuff done.""

The ""Frozen"" star added, ""But I will say, I notice how hard it is to pull them away from the TV at noon.""","Arnold Schwarzenegger, Reese Witherspoon parent with tough love: 'Learning from failure'",https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/arnold-schwarzenegger-reese-witherspoon-parent-with-tough-love-learning-from-failure,FOX News - Entertainment

Sarah Michelle Gellar has taken umbrage with Roblox after her son’s account was hacked, forcing her to cancel her credit card.

The Buffy the Vampire Slayer star, 46, took to Instagram on 4 December after her son’s Roblox account was allegedly hacked. Gellar - who shares son Rocky, 11, and daughter Charlotte Grace, 14, with husband Freddie Prinze Jr - shared a screenshot from her iPhone, displaying a notification that her iCloud account “has been disabled” in the App Store and iTunes.

“This is what I’ve been dealing with after my son’s @Roblox got hacked,” she wrote on her Instagram Story. “I had to cancel my credit card and now my life is basically cancelled.”

The Cruel Intentions actor added: “@Roblox Why don’t you have better parental help?!?”

Roblox is a widely-popular online game platform that “lets you play, create, and be anything you can imagine,” according to its description on the Microsoft Store. It allows players to customise characters and play minigames within the game. While Roblox is free to download on a number of platforms - including Android and iOS smartphones, Xbox game consoles, and Windows computers - players can also spend money on in-game items and customisations. According to TechCrunch, its millions of users range between ages eight and 18, although its key demographic is between nine and 15 years old.

Many social media users on X, formerly known as Twitter, were surprised by Gellar’s unexpected feud with the online gaming platform.

“This is the most important beef of 2023,” one person said, in response to Gellar’s Instagram Story post.

“Buffy vs Roblox is where all this Millennial vs Gen Z discourse has been heading,” another user joked.

While one user agreed that “being hacked on Roblox is life ruining,” someone else wondered why Gellar’s 11-year-old son was using his mother’s credit card in the first place. “Oh please. That’s not that bad,” they said. “And I don’t know why parents let their children use their debit/credit cards on games, like, make them pay themselves!”

In a statement to The Independent, a Roblox spokesperson revealed the company is looking into Gellar’s complaint. “We are looking into this case and we reached out directly to the user to help. We are committed to ensuring that our users have a positive experience on the platform,” they said. “In partnership with safety groups, we’ve developed tools and resources like our Parent & Caregiver Guide and other helpful resources for parents to have conversations with their kids and teens about staying safe, spending controls and protecting their account. Our support team works with parents and users directly 24/7 and can be contacted with questions here,” they added, including a link to its support page.

The Scooby-Doo star isn’t the only celebrity to publicly call out Roblox’s parental controls. In the season one premiere of The Kardashians, Hulu star Kim Kardashian went head to head with Roblox after her son Saint discovered what claimed to be unseen footage of her 2007 sex tape with her ex-boyfriend Ray J.

Saint, eight, was playing Roblox on a family member’s iPad when an icon of Kardashian’s infamous crying face popped up on his screen. When he showed his mother the icon, she pulled the iPad away after reading that the Roblox minigame had been registered under the username “KimsNewSexTape”.

The billionaire business mogul later shared in the episode that she planned on “suing” Roblox for using her name and likeness for a game. “I have all the time, all the money, and all of the resources to burn them all to the f***ing ground,” Kardashian said, adding: “This is supposed to be unreleased footage from my old tape, this is the last thing I want as a mom, for my past to be brought up 20 years later.”

According to Polygon, the developer of the minigame was reportedly banned from the online platform when the episode aired in April 2022. In a statement to the outlet, a spokesperson from Roblox confirmed the existence of the game, but explained that the “referenced video was never available on our platform”.

“The referenced video was never available on our platform - we have strict moderation and policies to protect our community, including zero tolerance for sexual content of any kind which violates our Community Rules,” the spokesperson said. “The text reference to the tape that got around our filters was quickly taken down and fortunately visible only to an extremely small number of people on the platform. We also swiftly took down the associated experience and banned the community developer involved with the incident.”",Sarah Michelle Gellar hits out at Roblox after her son’s account gets hacked,https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/sarah-michelle-gellar-roblox-hacked-b2458897.html,The Independent - Life and Style

That’s what we’re here for. We’re going to keep this post updated with the most recent series on each of the major streaming platforms that we liked, as well as some other options if our pick doesn’t sound like your particular jam.

So, below, find the best new shows on Netflix, Hulu, Prime Video, Max, Disney Plus, Paramount Plus, Apple TV, and Peacock. Our latest update added Castlevania: Nocturne, Gen V, Hijack, and The Continental.

The best new shows on Netflix

Castlevania: Nocturne

Creator: Clive Bradley

Cast: Edward Bluemel, Thuso Mbedu, Pixie Davies

To say that the follow-up to Netflix’s Castlevania had a lot to live up to would be an understatement. Based on Konami’s acclaimed action-adventure game series and produced by Texas-based Powerhouse Animation Studios, the original 32-episode adult animated series was an unmistakable success for the streamer when it premiered in 2017. Chronicling the adventures of Trevor Belmont, the last surviving descendant of a long line of monster hunters, and Sypha, a powerful magic wielder hailing from a reclusive tribe of magicians, the series followed the pair as they joined forces with Alucard, half-human son of Dracula, to slay his vengeful father and save humanity from the threat of extinction.

Castlevania: Nocturne picks up three centuries after the original, and while Trevor and Sypha may be dead, their legacy lives on in the series’ new protagonist, Richter Belmont. Set amid the French Revolution, Nocturne follows Richter as he is enlisted by a young sorceress named Annette to fight against a conspiracy of aristocrats who have allied themselves with a powerful enemy known as the Vampire Messiah. Haunted by the death of his mother at the hands of a mysterious vampire named Olrox, Richter must call upon every ounce of his courage to face this new darkness and assume his birthright as a Belmont. Castlevania: Nocturne is a terrific installment in the franchise that meets and exceeds the original Castlevania at its best. From its brilliantly realized character designs and exhilarating action sequences to its beautiful score and nuanced take on real-life revolutions, the series is both an excellent continuation and fantastic entry point for new audiences. —Toussaint Egan

Also good: The Diplomat, a light, plot-heavy political thriller starring Keri Russell; The Night Agent, a fun popcorn spy thriller from The Shield’s Shawn Ryan; Physical 100, a brilliant and brutal competition show; Ganglands, a visceral French crime thriller; Cyberpunk: Edgerunners, the anime from CD Projekt Red and Studio Trigger; The Makanai: Cooking for the Maiko House, a food-centric drama from master filmmaker Hirokazu Kore-eda; Derry Girls, the hilarious comedy set against the backdrop of the Troubles; and The Sandman, the live-action adaptation of the DC Comics fantasy horror series by Neil Gaiman.

The best new show on Hulu

Reservation Dogs

Creator: Sterlin Harjo

Cast: Devery Jacobs, D’Pharaoh Woon-A-Tai, Lane Factor

Reservation Dogs was a wonderful thing — a show about misfits living on a reservation in Oklahoma who want nothing more than to get far the hell away… until that far-the-hell-away becomes actually tangible. While Taika Waititi produces the show, it is blissfully removed from his particular (and for me, very tiring) brand of humor, instead shining through award-winning filmmaker Sterlin Harjo and a dynamic cast of main characters and featured guests (the second season included a memorable guest appearance by Prey star Amber Midthunder, and the legendary Gary Farmer and Wes Studi have hilarious recurring roles). The third season wrapped the show up on its terms, leaving an indelible mark on television and the culture at large. —PV

Also good: Love Island UK, the reality dating show, What We Do in the Shadows, the hilarious TV adaptation of the modern-day vampire mockumentary, and the final season of Atlanta, the “Twin Peaks for rappers” comedy drama starring (and created by) Donald Glover.

The best new TV on Prime Video

Gen V

Showrunners: Michele Fazekas, Tara Butters

Cast: Jaz Sinclair, Chance Perdomo, Lizze Broadway

Becoming a superhero is hard. This is an established principle — those origin stories aren’t all sunshine and rainbows! — but it’s doubly true in the universe of The Boys, where Gen V takes place. This is a world where your powers manifest with your first period and then kill your mom, as happened to Marie (Jaz Sinclair). She eventually winds up at Godolkin University, the only university for supes in particular, and — well, it’s the land of Vought International and The Boys. Trouble ensues from there.

What makes Gen V so compelling is how deftly it weaves together its themes. The (latest) conspiracy smoothly brings Marie and her cohort together, leapfrogging tropes and letting the story flow. Gen V manages to do the impossible: Make superhero TV feel like more than a collection of origin story tropes, and let its characters feel very grounded and like people. It’s The Boys, so you know you’re in for a giant dick or a puppet massacre, but it’s worth that buy-in to see just how well Gen V makes its grade. —Zosha Millman

Also good: A League of Their Own, an adaptation of the sports movie classic unfortunately canceled after just one season; Paper Girls, a sci-fi coming-of-age comic adaptation also unfortunately canceled after one season; and Reacher, a detective series that asks the important question, “What if Sherlock Holmes was absolutely massive?”

The best new TV on Max

Unicorn: Warriors Eternal

Creators: Genndy Tartakovsky, Darrick Bachman

Cast: Hazel Doupe, Demari Hunte, Tom Milligan, Paul Tylak

Genndy Tartakovsky is a name that needs no introduction among animation fans. The creator of such well-known and beloved series as Dexter’s Laboratory, Samurai Jack, Primal, and more, Tartakovsky is known for his imaginative worlds populated with eccentric and memorable characters. Unicorn: Warriors Eternal is the director-animator’s latest masterpiece; a fantasy action series over two decades in the making that follows a group of immortal heroes who are reincarnated across time and space to do battle against an ancient evil. The series combines several of Tartakovsky’s most passionate interests — the science-fiction of Osamu Tezuka’s Astro Boy, the steampunk-adjacent Victorian settings of Hayao Miyazaki’s work, the idiosyncratic character designs of Popeye creator E. C. Segar — to create an experience that feels unlike anything else on television in 2023, animated or otherwise. —Toussaint Egan

Also good: My Adventures with Superman, the slice-of-life action series based on the DC Comics superhero, Full Circle, Stephen Soderbergh’s miniseries loosely based on Akira Kurosawa’s High and Low, Danny McBride’s rapturously funny The Righteous Gemstones, and Harley Quinn, which is currently airing its fourth season.

The best new TV on Disney Plus

Andor

Creator: Tony Gilroy

Cast: Diego Luna, Kyle Soller, Adria Arjona

Aside from being one of the best Star Wars shows to date, Andor has the enviable distinction of holding the No. 1 spot on our list of the best shows of 2022. Either of those two facts alone warrants the show’s inclusion on this list, but combined, that well-earned place feels all but mandatory. Tony Gilroy (Michael Clayton) returns to the Star Wars after his turn as co-screenwriter on 2016’s Rogue One, diving into an origin story of the eponymous Rebel captain that also functions as an origin story of the Rebel Alliance itself. The series meticulously moves away from the rote, Easter egg-laden iconography for which many Star Wars fans typically associate the franchise with and substitutes it with down-to-earth aesthetic and tone that treats the stakes of its universe as seriously as the underdogs who occupy it.

Diego Luna, much like his character, Cassian Andor, is the perfect leading man for the job, while Stellan S​​karsgård’s supporting performance as the cunning rebellion ringleader Luthen Rael has quickly asserted itself as one of the best characters to come out of Star Wars since Disney acquired the property in 2012. It takes three or so episodes to shift into full gear, but once it does, it’s a exhilarating journey you’ll want to see through to the end. —Toussaint Egan

Also good: Willow, the TV revival of the 1988 fantasy adventure.

The Good Fight

Creators: Robert and Michelle King

Cast: Christine Baranski, Audra McDonald, a rotating cast of your favorite actors on TV

One of the initial promises of streaming television was that it would bring us the kind of shows that were not possible on more traditional broadcast or cable networks. In practice, this hasn’t actually amounted to much more than bloated episode length and the occasional one-off experiment, like Arrested Development season 4 or Netflix’s choose-your-own heist show Kaleidoscope.

The Good Fight, however, was different. The show opened its first season in 2017 with a very clear mission statement, as Diane Lockhart (Christine Baranski), a character from series predecessor The Good Wife, prepares to leave her cushy job as partner at a law firm to become a fashionable expat in Italy after the election of Donald Trump. Unfortunately for her, she loses her nest egg when her money is tied up in a Ponzi scheme, and is forced to go back to work — not at her old, majority-white firm, but at Chicago’s largest Black law firm.

With this setup, The Good Fight endeavored to tell the story of Trump-era America as it was written, and while it had its blind spots, it often did a better job of it than most cable news networks, telling unflinching stories about race in America, right-wing internet trolls, and the outrage economy that drives culture wars. But it was also one of the most inventive shows on television — any given episode could have animated musical segments explaining geopolitics, stories about a secret court that Mandy Patinkin runs like a game show, or a cutaway gag ruminating on whether or not Jeffrey Epstein had his penis frozen for preservation. In this, it was the Star Trek of legal dramas, always different, full of ideas, and gloriously messy. —Joshua Rivera

Also good: Star Trek: Strange New Worlds, the best of a stellar crop of new Star Trek shows.

Hijack

Creators: George Kay, Jim Field Smith

Cast: Idris Elba, Neil Maskell, Archie Panjabi

Hijack is almost exactly what it sounds like: It’s about a hijacking. But that simplicity of premise belies a much richer, much more fun story, something that reads much more like a breezy blockbuster thriller of yore than another drop in the streaming TV bucket. Comparing TV to movies can be seen as derogatory, suggesting a show lacks the pacing of quality television, but here it just serves to highlight how effectively Hijack is doing what it’s doing. This is a show that knows what it’s about.

As does Sam Nelson (Idris Elba), one of the many passengers just trying to make it home when his plane gets suddenly hijacked by a group of terrorists. Without arousing suspicion from the gunmen closely watching the plane, Sam and his fellow travelers have to figure out how to secure the plane and get everyone home safely.

Hijack is taut, making every moment count, even in ways you don’t expect. Little details that feel brushed past are returned to, and things that first seem like plot holes get filled in, exploited by the passengers or the hijackers. And it’s told in close to real time, with every minute and every decision made by those on the plane (and on the ground, as British law enforcement mobilizes to help on their end). It’s twisty, it’s neat, and it involves Idris Elba ducking around a plane — something Elba said he had to really do, since he is very tall and they filmed in an actual plane. In a world drowning in watchlists that grow larger by the day, Hijack is a breath of fresh air: easy, competent, and just a pure pleasure. —ZM

Also good: Severance, a stark science fiction take on the modern workplace; Slow Horses, a British spy drama about a bunch of losers (including Gary Oldman) who would like a win.

The Continental: From the World of John Wick

Creators: Greg Coolidge, Kirk Ward, Shawn Simmons

Cast: Colin Woodell, Mishel Prada, Hubert Point-Du Jour

I entered The Continental warily. The world of John Wick didn’t exactly need a prequel series, and it was hard to imagine a television show could come anywhere close to matching the exhilarating highs of the movies’ action sequences.

But early on, one thing gave me hope: The hiring of action legend Larnell Stovall to lead the show’s fight sequences. And boy, did Stovall and his team deliver: From the show’s opening heist sequence to the incredible rooftop fight in the third episode, The Continental delivers reliable bangers throughout its three-episode run. The show smartly avoids becoming too loyal to the movies’ visual style — something the miniseries could never accurately mimic on a more limited budget. Instead, The Continental leans into action appropriate for the era it is set in, and builds surprisingly strong characters and relationships in our brief time at the hotel. —PV

Also good: Poker Face, Rian Johnson’s inverted detective series starring Natasha Lyonne; Grand Crew, a sitcom about Black wine aficionados; Girls5Eva, a hilarious comedy about a girl group getting back together; The Resort, a dark mystery-comedy starring William Jackson Harper (The Good Place) and Cristin Milioti (Made for Love) as a couple on vacation who stumble across a deadly mystery.",The best new TV series on every streaming service,https://www.polygon.com/what-to-watch/23560732/best-new-tv-shows-netflix-prime-hbo-max-hulu-streaming,Polygon
entertainment,Abe Beame,2023-10-26T14:02:00+00:00,"In 2021, Quentin Tarantino defended his intention to make “just” 10 movies and retire, saying, “I know film history, and from here on in, directors do not get better.” That view of both artistry and film is squarely at odds with Martin Scorsese’s historic body of work. Scorsese had already made his 10th feature-length narrative film by 1986. He is now 80 years old, and his 27th, Killers of the Flower Moon, is a strong argument that directors are still capable of groundbreaking greatness late in life — and in Scorsese’s case, continued exhilarating experimentation and discovery.

Since the year 2000, Scorsese has curated a 23-year career within a career, and the quality and variety of his films have come not in spite of his age and experience, but because of it. His movies have never been more relevant than they became during the past two decades. With each subsequent release, as his career winds down, critical appreciation for him grows. Scorsese worship is the one remaining form of gerontocracy America is perfectly content with, and with good reason.

In the 21st century alone, Scorsese has made nine feature-length narrative films: Gangs of New York, The Aviator, The Departed, Shutter Island, Hugo, The Wolf of Wall Street, Silence, The Irishman, and now, Killers of the Flower Moon. His stretch from 1976’s Taxi Driver through 1990’s Goodfellas is still his peak run, the films that defined his style and his perspective. But decades from now, the nine features he’s made since 2000 won’t be looked back on as half-baked, indulgent afterthoughts from a diminished artist who lost his fastball, a fate some great auteurs suffer in old age. Instead, it’s a fertile, vital body of work, virtuosic in entirely new ways, and as important in contextualizing his greatness as all the incredible work that preceded it.

Old classics

Some of those nine movies are long-gestating bucket-list triumphs revisiting the pet subjects that defined Scorsese’s oeuvre in the 20th century, often directly commenting on work from the front half of his career. 2002’s Gangs of New York, about how organized crime was woven into the operation of Scorsese’s native city from its inception, is a prequel (or ancestor) to his classics Goodfellas and Casino. 2019’s The Irishman, about a man aging and dying with his guilt and sins unresolved at the end of a life of crime, is intended as a bookend to his crime trilogy with Robert De Niro and Joe Pesci. 2016’s Silence is in conversation with, if not a synthesis of, the ideas explored in The Last Temptation of Christ and Kundun; all three are searching, anti-commercial religious films Scorsese struggled for years to get made.

In all Scorsese’s late-period films (along with the passel of rock documentaries he’s made during this era, including his two on Bob Dylan and one on George Harrison), Scorsese is consciously returning to certain pet subjects and periods in his work — not to repeat himself, but to revise and add greater perspective. There’s a sense that he’s trying to adjust his positions with the clear eye of an older person who has seen more of the world, dropped his pretensions, and lost his capacity for bullshit. His later films return to his old themes and obsessions, but in the process, they’ve become more contemplative.

New tricks

This era has included some radical departures for Scorsese as well. 2004’s The Aviator is his most conventional movie to date, the most traditional, Oscar-baity, Old Hollywood biography he’s made. It’s best understood as a director-for-hire palate-cleanser after Scorsese completed the odyssey of making the perpetually troubled Gangs of New York. 2010’s Shutter Island is horror and suspense, an expert exercise in pure genre, part Hammer Films and part Alfred Hitchcock. It also contains some of the most inventive, moving, and painterly visuals he’s ever committed to film.

And 2011’s Hugo is perhaps the hardest Scorsese film to imagine a younger Scorsese making. It’s a 3D Robert Zemeckis-style family film that’s also about the end of life and about immortality in art. Scorsese made the film as a love letter to Georges Méliès, Harold Lloyd, and his own then-12-year-old daughter, Francesca. It’s a project seemingly designed to remind fathers of all the times they tried to introduce their kids to their favorite old films. Hugo is explicitly about Scorsese’s legendary cinephilia in a way his films that came before it are not, and it’s sentimental in a way his work has never been before or since.

New life

2002’s Gangs of New York was the final product of an interesting but ultimately flawed compromise between Scorsese and producer Harvey Weinstein. But the film retains significance because it’s the beginning of the defining relationship in this portion of Scorsese’s career, with Leonardo DiCaprio. It was a symbiotic partnership that elevated both men: the industry outsider who needed a safe box-office bet to finally get his epic, expensive dream projects financed, and the teen heartthrob who needed an auteur with arthouse gravitas to take him seriously so the industry would.

To date, the project has been wildly successful, producing six films over 21 years. The first five (Gangs of New York, The Aviator, The Departed, Shutter Island, The Wolf of Wall Street) are Scorsese’s top five highest-grossing films, with the box office for Killers incoming. Over the years, the Scorsese-DiCaprio team-up has served as a true creative marriage. The two men now share a manager in Rick Yorn, the man responsible for discovering DiCaprio. It’s evidence DiCaprio hasn’t “just” been a muse and face on the posters; he’s had a say in deciding what projects Scorsese has taken on, and has even made significant decisions in shaping Scorsese’s stories. (Scorsese entirely reimagined Killers of the Flower Moon after DiCaprio offered notes on an early draft of the script, including shifting focus to a different main character and moving DiCaprio into that role.)

For certain older filmmakers — say, Clint Eastwood — aging has meant settling for more routine and less challenging stories and shots, on a tight production schedule. Scorsese went in the other direction. From the outside, The Departed appears to be a cynical, domestic remake of a Hong Kong cops-and-robbers shootout. But Scorsese makes it his own and breathes bizarre life and energy into it. It contains the continuity errors, quick cutting, both rhythmic and arrhythmic needle bombs, and goofball humor his movies hadn’t featured since Goodfellas. That film essentially birthed an entire genre of filmic language, but The Departed goes a step beyond the original. It was constantly being rewritten and adjusted with the actors on the fly. The result was exhilarating seat-of-the-pants filmmaking that Scorsese and his longtime creative partner, editor Thelma Schoonmaker, wrangled into a coherent film.

Scorsese brought this cokey, maximalist energy to The Wolf of Wall Street, a pointed comedy as wildly, masterfully off the rails and improvisational as anything he’s ever done. (Jonah Hill perhaps smuggled in a touch of Judd Apatow’s “Keep the camera rolling” ethos.) You can feel a healthy dose of Scorsese’s established-filmmaker confidence (and a touch of “Eh, why not? Fuck it!” thinking) as DiCaprio’s Ferrari changes color mid-narration during a highway blowjob, and when DiCaprio addresses the camera directly, urging the audience not to worry about specific plot points. It’s an absolute miracle Scorsese and Schoonmaker manage to produce a masterpiece out of the chaotic pieces of this production process (again in post, with ample voice-over). Everyone is letting loose, and to hear the actors and the director describe the shoot after the fact, it takes on something of a religious quality, with Scorsese as the wrinkled shaman handing out the peyote.

What grounds it is the framing. Scorsese is telling us a familiar story we’ve come to expect from him, about criminals and the pleasure they take in committing crimes and reaping the benefits. The brilliance is the way he mines filmgoers’ long relationship with his work, repurposing the style and tone of his gangster classics and inserting it into the world of finance. As he’s done effectively since Casino, Scorsese weaponizes postmodernism, using viewers’ presumed existing familiarity with his films as context. You don’t get the full gale force of this film, its pleasures and its overarching point, without Scorsese reaching back to his past work, and relying on viewers to recognize his voice in the storytelling.

Killers of the Flower Moon

Killers of the Flower Moon is perhaps most closely related to The Aviator as a film that appears to be a recognizable, industry-friendly form of awards-season prestige. It’s also a return to Scorsese’s core themes and characters. It’s another cast of avarice-fueled, violent white American dumbasses gaining ill-gotten wealth and making the country incrementally worse. It’s again about those men failing up, consolidating power, and shading the country more evil.

Killers adapts a major literary work of historical true crime from a New Yorker writer. The book delves into an obscure but monstrous historical incident that is a cosmic truth in miniature, an evil that speaks to the heart of the entire dark American project. On screen, it’s Scorsese’s first true Western, filled with gorgeous vistas and Oklahoma horizons that would bring a tear to the eye of John Ford, one of Scorsese’s many idols.

But the film is much stranger than it sounds on paper. Scorsese’s take on the material largely operates outside the text, centering the story on a peripheral character we know little about from David Grann’s book. Miraculously, the film also has its funny elements, incorporating The Departed and The Wolf of Wall Street’s nervy energy, featuring long and zany improvisational exchanges on grim subject matter, sudden wild swings in tone, and one major decision that should spark more debate and differences of opinion than any narrative device Scorsese has ever employed. It’s a suspenseful, moving film with many brilliant parts.

Killers is a classic Scorsese Catholic reckoning. This time, the director is concerned with white supremacy and systemic racism, full of unsparing and punishing conclusions and self recriminations in the wake of George Floyd’s death and the 2020 protests. (In a press conference on Oct. 16, Scorsese described the film as “a story of complicity, a story of sin by omission.”)

Scorsese is expressing guilt and culpability as a beneficiary of this inequality. In the movie’s closing minutes, he literally puts himself squarely in the frame. That’s a level of awareness that goes beyond the introverted morality plays he grappled with earlier in his career: It’s a mature framing of the individual, and the responsibilities we have toward one another, on a societal scale.

In a charitable light, adding himself to the movie as the voice of its final reckoning is a bold statement of accountability. In an uncharitable light, it plays as performative, as an older relative getting worked up over a police brutality Facebook post. It’s too early to decide how this film tags into our present historical moment, or how it will be remembered. We all have many viewings of and conversations about Killers of the Flower Moon ahead of us.

A true master

This century has seen Scorsese zigging and zagging as always, but because he’s following his own varied interests, not because he’s moving from compromise to compromise, as he once had to in order to continue working. An artist who spent the first 30 years of his career desperate for autonomy finally got it, and now he’s taking full advantage: telling difficult stories, setting his own mega-budgets, and demanding every minute of run time he feels each picture demands.

He’s used this autonomy to revisit his work and revise the record, creating great new films as well as adding crucial addendums to past work. He’s blazing new trails and adding new layers to his style.

Martin Scorsese has put his knowledge of internet slang to the test in a new TikTok challenge posted by none other than his daughter, Francesca Scorsese.

In a TikTok posted by Francesca on Thursday 5 October, the father-daughter duo appeared on camera while the legendary director’s daughter explained that she was going to quiz him on popular internet slang. “I’m going to ask you to guess what specific slang terms mean,” Francesca told her father, 80.

“You’re going to tell me the slang word and I have to give you what I think it means,” Scorsese chimed in, in classic style.

The first - and arguably most important - internet slang word that Francesca quizzed her father on was “tea”, as she gave the example: “I’m going to spill the tea.”

The Killers of the Flower Moon director shouted out his answer: “That means you’re gonna tell all you know.”

Francesca’s face then lit up with shock after her father guessed the internet slang term somewhat correctly, and a green check mark emoji appeared over their heads.

The next term she gave her father was “ick” and added the example: “He clapped when the plane landed and that gave me the ick.”

“You were thoroughly repulsed by it,” Scorsese answered correctly, causing his daughter to burst out in laughter.

The third slang was “sneaky link” - a term used when someone is going to discreetly meet up with their romantic interest. “These are our personal peccadillos that you may have,” he said. “Things that you don’t want other people to know about, or just people close to you or something like that.”

When Francesca explained to her father that the term “sneaky link” is similar to a “booty call”, the Goodfellas director’s eyes suddenly lit up. “Oh, really? We never use that, we never saw specific people in my day,” he replied, before curtly asking his daughter in his signature Italian-American accent: “What else you got?”

For the phrase “hits different”, his daughter fittingly used a film reference to explain what the term means to her dad. “Watching a movie in 70 mm film hits different,” she said.

“It’s an easy one. You perceive it in a totally different way,” Scorsese responded. “It’s another perspective of the image, so to speak, and the effect the film has on the audience.”

“Like, it’s much better,” she corrected. “Hits different, like: ‘Oh, this is amazing.”

While the Wolf of Wall Street director answered the term “slept on” incorrectly, his reasoning for the definition wasn’t totally inaccurate. “I was thinking about some stuff so I slept on it,” Scorsese said. However, Francesca then used the slang word in terms that only Scorsese could understand.

“King of Comedy was slept on,” she added, referring to her father’s 1983 film starring Robert De Niro. The King of Comedy received mostly positive reviews from critics when it was released, but it was a flop at the box office.

“People hated it when it came out,” he corrected himself, before turning his gaze towards the camera. “It was the flop of the year, that’s what it was called on Entertainment Tonight, New Year’s Eve ‘83 to ‘84. It’s okay, it’s alright.”

The father-daughter duo continued on with the term “ate”, as Francesca used an example from Scorsese’s upcoming film: “Lily Gladstone ate in Killers of the Flower Moon.” Although he took the term “ate” very literally by initially saying, “Consumed the screen”, Scorsese eventually came up with the simple answer: “Ruled.”

For the slang term “no cap”, Scorsese instantly answered it correctly as “no lying”. However, he then asked his daughter in classic dad fashion: “How many more of these?”

When it came to the internet slang “ship”, the Taxi Driver director wasted no time in replying: “A ship is a boat.” Francesca aided her father with the example, “I ship you and mom,” but he still didn’t seem to understand the phrase. “Take us around somewhere?”

The next term was “simp” - meaning someone who displays excessive affection in a relationship - but Scorsese decided to come up with his own definition: “Sympathise, a simpy person. A person who’s whining all the time, they’re simps.”

“Simp used to mean a wimpy person, a person who’s always complaining and stuff like that,” he added. “I do that a lot, complain a lot.”

For the term “throw shade”, Scorsese immediately understood what it meant after his daughter gave the film-themed example: “That critic threw so much shade.” He was also quick to answer the slang “slaps” when Francesca said: “This dessert slaps.”

“Obviously, it’s good,” he replied.

The final internet slang Francesca gave her famous father was none other than the term, “slay”.

“This video slays. We slayed in this video” she gave the example, as the Gangs of New York director answered: “That means it’s really good?”

Since it was posted on Thursday, Francesca’s video of her father guessing popular slang terms has been viewed one million times on TikTok. Not only were people in the comments section shocked to see the legendary director on their screens, but they were also stunned that he managed to guess many of the terms correctly.

“Can’t believe we live in a world where I get to watch Martin Scorsese become familiar with the term sneaky link. Blessings,” read one comment.

“I cannot believe I exist in a timeline where I can watch Martin Scorsese film TikToks,” another said.

“I can’t believe I’m watching one of the greatest filmmakers of our lifetime be quizzed by his daughter about teen slang lol,” a third user wrote, while someone else said: “Gonna describe sneaky links as personal picadillos from now on.”

This isn’t the first time Scorsese has made a special appearance in one of his daughter’s TikTok videos. In April 2021, Francesca went viral when she asked her father to identify “feminine products”, such as an eyelash curler, bobby pins, a hair donut and nipple pasties.",Martin Scorsese gets quizzed by his daughter on internet slang,https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/martin-scorsese-daughter-tiktok-internet-slang-b2427269.html,The Independent - Life and Style
entertainment,Mike Mahardy,2023-10-31T16:30:45+00:00,"For the first year in recent memory, scale did not necessitate tradition, and scope did not preclude getting weird. In 2023, nothing was sacred in video games, and so they felt more vibrant than ever.

Sure, some of the more “focused” games threw us for a pleasant loop: Dredge begins as a lonely fishing sim before transforming into something otherworldly, and Humanity morphed from a pensive art project into an all-out war. Dave the Diver, similarly, is not so much about being a diver as it is about running a sushi restaurant, or hunting for alien artifacts, or conversing with said aliens, or — you get the point. Whether you booted up your Steam Deck for a cross-country flight or hid your Switch off screen during that boring Zoom meeting, the game you returned to was rarely the one you left behind.

This amorphousness (I’m begging our copy editor to let this one slide, because what other “word” could adequately summarize the video games of 2023?) wasn’t consigned to the newcomers, though. Larian Studios, fresh off two years of early-access development and riding the reputation it had garnered from Divinity: Original Sin 2, saw fit to release a role-playing game in which you can kill off nearly every main character the moment you meet them. Remedy Entertainment — let’s be honest, this group has always been strange — made a sequel that’s equal parts horrifying, hilarious, fun, and fabulous. And Nintendo? Well, Nintendo had another banner year. That’s no surprise. The real surprise? It finally let go, and let players toy with the digital molecules of its most revered series. More on this below.

As the year comes to a close, it’s intoxicating to see developers of all sizes, in every genre, with every tier of budget, mining the depths of interactive design, branching this way and that as they follow their respective veins of gold. They’re nowhere near the bottom of that particular expanse, of course — and that’s a heartening thought. —Mike Mahardy

How the Polygon top 50 list works

Over the past few weeks, the Polygon staff voted, championed, debated, and ultimately threw up its hands and marveled at the list of mammoths, curiosities, puzzle boxes, and black holes that is our top 50 games of 2023. Any video games that were released in 2023, received substantial updates in 2023, or achieved renewed cultural relevance in 2023 were eligible for this list. Last year, the cutoff for consideration was Nov. 30. (You’ll notice a certain Firaxis Games joint fairly high up our list.) This year, the cutoff was the same. Should we be thoroughly enamored with Warhammer 40,000: Rogue Trader or Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora, we’ll make sure they’re considered for next year’s top 50.

Top 50

50. Mr. Sun’s Hatbox

Developer: Kenny Sun

Where to play: Nintendo Switch and Windows PC

Mr. Sun’s Hatbox is about a hat delivery person (or maybe it’s just a blob with legs?) that takes their job way too seriously. At the beginning of the game, a customer’s package gets stolen and whisked away to a nearby towering castle. Despite the client’s apathy toward a single missing hat, the delivery company, named Amazin, proceeds to set up an entire subterranean paramilitary operation beneath the poor customer’s home.

As its premise suggests, this pixelated 2D roguelite leans into the absurd. Part Metal Gear Solid 5, part Spelunky, you undertake missions where you blast away enemies and kidnap them for your own operation, all while slapstick action unfolds. While on a mission, anything from a desk lamp to daggers is fair game for a weapon. In between fights, you expand your base, where you manage a staff of brainwashed blob-people. It’s fast, frenetic fun, and especially enjoyable to share with friends in co-op. —Ana Diaz

49. Lies of P

Developer: Neowiz Games

Where to play: Mac, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Windows PC, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X

Yes, Lies of P is a Dark Souls mixed with Pinocchio, and that’s a questionable elevator pitch from the outset.

In the years leading up to Lies of P, “Pinocchiosouls” was more of a running joke than anything — this profane idea that you can take any world and slap some Dark Souls into it to get people mildly interested. But once you’re in the game, eliminating bosses left and right with your sweet parry moves, you’ll quickly find yourself entirely unbothered by how strange Lies of P initially seemed. And you’ll start telling your partner things like “I have to go back to Geppetto to upgrade my puppet body” like it’s a perfectly normal task to assign yourself on a Tuesday afternoon.

It’s very rare for a Soulslike to ever feel like anything more than a knockoff — even when they’re decent fun, like The Surge. But the best compliment I can give Lies of P is that it feels like the genuine article, a FromSoftware game developed in an alternate dimension and somehow released in this one by mistake. But it wasn’t a mistake or luck that made Lies of P, and it wasn’t FromSoftware, either; it was a talented group of developers at Neowiz Games and Round8 Studio that took a tired genre, paired it with a bizarre IP, and knocked it out of the park. —Ryan Gilliam

Related Lies of P carves a singular space out of the Soulsborne genre

48. Tchia

Developer: Awaceb

Where to play: PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, and Windows PC

Tchia is an open-world adventure game set in a fictional version of island nation New Caledonia — inspired by Awaceb’s co-founder’s childhood in the country.

Everything is filtered through the titular main character Tchia’s eyes, eyes with a special power that allows her to transform into any animals or objects in her environment. Birds, dolphins, a camera, or rocks… It’s all an option for Tchia.

The game, while clearly inspired by The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild, ends up standing on its own because of the innovative shapeshifting mechanics. Tchia isn’t as technically polished as a Nintendo title with hundreds of developers; Awaceb has a team of roughly a dozen. Still, it’s hard to innovate in such a ubiquitous genre, yet Awaceb has managed to do just that with Tchia, making it one of the best games so far this year. —Nicole Carpenter

47. Blasphemous 2

Developer: The Game Kitchen

Where to play: Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Windows PC, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X

Long gone are the days when the Metroidvania genre languished untouched for years on end. But despite an influx of entries in recent years, few have exhibited as much mastery as Blasphemous 2. Building off of the strong roots of the first game, Blasphemous 2 continues to use Spanish Catholicism as a narrative and aesthetic touchpoint, telling a twisted religious tale that’s about as far from proselytizing as you can get.

After the success of the first game, the developers have focused on refining the combat, adding multiple weapons and bizarre, hidden customization options that allow you to take command of how your character rips this world to shreds. The last time I played a 2D Metroidvania with this much polish and charm, it was Hollow Knight. Blasphemous 2 might not reach those same heights, but it comes damn close. —Russ Frushtick

46. Party Animals

Developer: Recreate Games

Where to play: Windows PC and Xbox Series X

I do not know how Recreate Games managed to render some of the cutest animals I’ve ever seen. I also do not know how Recreate made me completely OK with picking up these cute animals and flinging them into black holes, poison clouds, or freezing tundras. The second the match starts in Party Animals, all those cute fluffy corgis, rabbits, kitties, and ducks become my enemies. I will beat them with a bat until they can’t wake up anymore, and I won’t think twice about it. Party Animals may have made me a monster? I don’t know.

The Gang Beasts-esque wiggly physics mixed with the cute characters makes for a perfect party game of fluffy fighting. —Julia Lee

45. The Talos Principle 2

Developer: Croteam

Where to play: PlayStation 5, Windows PC, and Xbox Series X

Like its predecessor, The Talos Principle 2 tackles grand science fiction ideas, particularly about what it means to be human — a theme thoroughly explored in this installment of the series set in a post-human society of AI-powered robots that are carrying on human culture and civilization. Also like its predecessor, The Talos Principle 2 is replete with philosophical commentary and references to famous artists and thinkers. My favorite is a riff on Werner Herzog’s famous quote about birds: “The enormity of their flat brain. The enormity of their stupidity is just overwhelming.”

But if you’re like me, you’re playing the game because you’re an absolute freak for light refraction, gravity, and geospatial puzzles. There are so many puzzles in this game — there’s even a puzzle metagame, spread across the game’s gorgeous map — and they’re each excellent, teaching you new concepts before refracting them and forcing you to think differently. —Nicole Clark

44. Fading Afternoon

Developer: yeo

Where to play: Windows PC

Video games demand an account for your time. Some video games track the minutes and hours you’ve spent on screen. Others impose strict limits on how long you play, or how much you can do. But all video games constantly ask: How will you spend your time? Seiji Maruyama doesn’t know how much time he has left. Fresh out of prison, he’s not a young man anymore, but he doesn’t want the streets to know. So he returns to his life as a yakuza heavy, hoping to make his mark again.

Fading Afternoon ends when Seiji’s time runs out. Based on the choices you make, the consequences of which are initially obfuscated, this could be five minutes after the game begins, or it could be five hours. He has a bad cough and a pack of cigarettes, each a metaphor for the ticking clock inside of him. You could go to work, brawling on the streets. Or you can simply pass the time: Listen to a jazz band. Play video poker. Buy a home. Fall in love. You have the time, until you don’t. —Joshua Rivera

43. Suika Game

Developer: Aladdin X

Where to play: Nintendo Switch

I thank VTubers every day for many things, but I will kiss the feet of the anime avatars that introduced me to Suika Game. The engrossing 2048-meets-Tetris-with-physics fruit drop game has become my go-to whenever I need to kill some time. Note that I am talking about the official Nintendo Switch version, not all of the horrific ad-plagued knockoffs that have flooded the App Store.

The thing that makes Suika so special, in addition to its cutesy gameplay, is its quality as a social game. The same way we sit around and talk about our NYT Connections, we sit around and talk about our fruitless (ha) attempts at getting double watermelons or breaking the 3,000 point threshold. It’s also a great game to watch: Nothing is funnier than seeing somebody’s Suika run go downhill in 30 seconds flat. (There’s a reason why the game has taken the streaming world by storm.) —JL

42. League of Legends Season 13

Developer: Riot Games

Where to play: Mac and Windows PC

League of Legends’ 13th season is one of the game’s most balanced yet. Almost every champion has felt viable throughout the year — no small feat for a game with over 140 playable characters — and it’s led to great fun and variety on the solo queue ladder and in professional play, where an exciting Worlds just wrapped up.

But there’s another reason League had an outstanding 2023: Arena, a new game mode introduced during the game’s summer event. Arena is a 2v2v2v2 battle mode with fast-paced chaos, using League’s roster of champions in a more approachable and containable setting (and with less rage-inducing teammates). The mode was removed after the conclusion of the summer event, but is reportedly returning soon. It can’t possibly come soon enough; I know how I’ll be spending a good chunk of my winter. —Pete Volk

Related Arcane is officially League of Legends canon now

41. Goodbye Volcano High

Developer: KO_OP

Where to play: PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, and Windows PC

Goodbye Volcano High is a visual novel with rhythm game elements, and it takes place at the precipice of the end of the world. It’s centered on a group of teenage dinosaurs entering their senior year of high school, a perfect balance between high school dramatics and the grim future of Earth, as a meteor rockets toward the planet. Though the rhythm game elements can feel a bit finicky — and don’t seem to matter much, in terms of progressing the game — Goodbye Volcano High’s music only adds to the dimensional, raw experience created by worker-owned studio KO_OP.

It’s rare to find a game that takes the teenage experience seriously, but Goodbye Volcano High does just that. It’s a time in your life where you feel so, so much. You can see that earnestness in the teenage experience where everything is a big, huge issue — sometimes to the point of cringe — tied up in that big, global issue of the meteor that’s looking to destroy everything. —N. Carpenter

40. World of Warcraft Classic

Developer: Blizzard Entertainment

Where to play: Mac and Windows PC

Something very, very interesting started to happen in the retro version of WoW this year. While Blizzard has been content to march one half of the game’s community forward through its history of expansions, it’s started to come up with creative ways to keep the other half — the half that wants to stay in the game as it was at launch — engaged.

The first of these was Hardcore, a brilliant permadeath mode that instantly made this aging game both more dangerous and more social, resurrecting the spirit of its 2004 servers. The second, just launched, is the wild Season of Discovery, which remixes and restructures the original WoW experience — interpolating staggered level caps, shuffling class roles — in ways that might just change MMO design forever. WoW Classic is quietly, and paradoxically, where Blizzard is doing its most forward-thinking work right now. —Oli Welsh

39. Fire Emblem Engage

Developer: Intelligent Systems

Where to play: Nintendo Switch

Fire Emblem Engage was designed for a very specific kind of sicko: one not particularly interested in the origin stories of a horde of teenagers, or the politics of a bourgeoise academy, or what kind of tea a teacher prefers, but instead one obsessed with the endless minutiae of combat stats, weapon loadouts, and team composition. I know this because I am one such sicko.

If you’ve read any of my reviews or essays on Polygon, then you know I prefer strategy games that can get out of their own way. More precisely, I love when strategy developers can put their pens down, throw their hands up, and admit that the stories unfolding in the player’s head will almost always be more powerful than anything they could write. Fire Emblem Engage is one of the foremost proponents of this idea. It hurls an excess of characters, weapons, battle scenarios, and stat-boosting abilities at you, leaving the door open for you to observe character interactions on the battlefield and create the resulting fanfiction in your head. Its actual script is a quagmire of nonsensical JRPG tropes, and each cutscene is more skippable than the next. But if you’re looking for an excellent turn-based tactics game that gets out of the player’s way, you can do a whole lot worse than Fire Emblem Engage. —M. Mahardy

38. Pizza Tower

Developer: Tour De Pizza

Where to play: Windows PC

Pizza Tower is a perfect object, and fully committed to its vision. You play as Peppino Spaghetti, a chef who must race up the pizza tower in order to defeat the existential threat posed by Pizzaface, an enormous floating pizza that also happens to be sentient. Super normal stuff. To get there, you platform through a series of levels, picking up speed as you zoom through enemies and obstacles. It’s easy to get into a flow state.

Pizza Tower also beautifully captures the essence of the Wario Land series. The game is delightful to look at, with an irreverent art style that’s referential to late-’90s and early-2000s cartoons, and absurd enemies and animations. Levels are also chock-full of secret rooms, passageways, and treasures, making it hard to put down and fun to replay. —N. Clark

Related Pizza Tower is platformer paradise for Wario freaks

37. Subpar Pool

Developer: grapefrukt games

Where to play: Android, iOS, Nintendo Switch, and Windows PC

You can play this delightful physics puzzler — best described as dynamic minigolf on a pool table — on Switch or Steam if you want, but it’s most at home on your phone. It’s an absolutely ideal mobile game: a reasonably priced paid app with no ads, in-app purchases, or subscription, playable in a spare three minutes. Pocket adorable, smiling pool balls on tables adorned with conveyor belts, portals, and moving pockets, while challenging yourself with a host of mix-and-match rulesets (balls that crack, split, or home in on you, a locked starting position, more balls, no guideline for bounces, etc.). Mobile gamers of taste will recognize the work of grapefrukt, aka Martin Jonasson, Swedish developer of such elegant classics as Holedown, Twofold Inc., and Rymdkapsel. —OW

36. Amnesia: The Bunker

Where to play: PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Windows PC, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X

If only one developer could be said to have a master’s grasp on interactive horror, I’d have to tip my hat to Frictional Games. The Amnesia series has always been a thrill ride of terrifying chases and the quiet, a little too quiet, moments that build up tension between. Amnesia: The Bunker is no different. In fact, it’s one of Frictional’s best.

Set in a seemingly abandoned bunker that’s been sealed by explosions during World War I, your simple yet difficult task is to find an exit. This being a horror game, though, you also have to collect fuel for the bunker’s generator — a veritable beating heart — and scrutinize maps on safe room walls, before venturing into the titular structure’s labyrinthine bowels. Oh, also! There’s a monster hunting you. And it can ambush you from wall vents. And it’s attracted to even the slightest bit of sound. And whether you’re juicing your hand-cranked flashlight, triggering long-forgotten tripwires, or just opening a heavy door into yet another concrete-encased corridor, you’re going to have to make noise at some point. The Bunker is as potent in its terror as any horror video game out there. —M. Mahardy

35. Lil Gator Game

Developer: MegaWobble

Where to play: Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Windows PC, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X

In an unprecedented year for game releases, I understand why you’re surprised to see Lil Gator Game this high up on our list. But imagine how surprised I was to find myself, in a moment of introspection, realizing that it was one of my own favorite games in 2023. At the risk of diminishing its accomplishments, I’m going to make a comparison that should cut to the quick for interested parties: This is the most A Short Hike-alike that I’ve discovered yet, and I’ve been chasing that singular high for years. So if you have a lazy weekend afternoon and want to spend it playing — not gaming, but playing, in the joyous, unstructured sense of a day in the park — I can’t recommend this li’l game enough. —Chris Grant

Related Lil Gator Game has the heart of Wind Waker and the adventure of Breath of the Wild

34. Starfield

Developer: Bethesda Game Studios

Where to play: Windows PC and Xbox Series X

Starfield had so much to prove, it’s easy to lose sight of what it accomplished: top-tier world-building, a fantastically customizable ship builder, and Bethesda’s most engaging combat to date. Galaxy-spanning faction quests give you plenty to do, but it’s the side quests that really make you feel like the captain in something Star Trek adjacent: generation ships and superhero hideouts and colonies of clones. There’s good sci-fi here for those willing to make the journey.

It’s true that the game oversold the idea of a galaxy with over 1,000 planets, a number that pales in comparison to the game’s most obvious competitor, No Man’s Sky. It’s a shame this became so much of the focus thanks to Bethesda’s marketing, because that same focus obscured the absolutely fascinating new game plus mode at the game’s heart. Consider this: No Man’s Sky is the game that realizes the universe’s infinite number of planets, while Starfield realizes the universe’s infinite number of possibilities. —Clayton Ashley

33. System Shock

Developer: Nightdive Studios

Where to play: Windows PC

In a year of several stellar remakes and immersive sims, it wouldn’t have been surprising if System Shock showed its age of nearly 30 years. At least, it would have been understandable if the changes needed to update the game would leave it nigh unrecognizable. That’s why Nightdive Studios’ accomplish is so impressive: It updated the 1994 classic with a slick coat of modern paint while also preserving what made the game so thrilling in the first place.

The element where that’s most evident is in the game’s look, which captures all of the original System Shock’s garish cyberpunk neons and frightening enemies in a style that appears like a modern high-fidelity game at a distance, but subtly transforms into retro pixel bitmaps on closer inspection. In much the same way, the gameplay feels surprisingly modern at a distance, but on closer inspection, you start to see how this proto-immersive sim is actually what inspired so much modern game design. You have to rely on your own curiosity, caution, and cunning to navigate the halls of Citadel Station and upgrade your hacker into a cybernetic death machine. It’s a game that expects a lot from the player (and a little save scumming), but the experience is just as rewarding as it was in 1994. —CA

Related The System Shock remake does something remarkable

32. Star Wars Jedi: Survivor

Developer: Respawn Entertainment

Where to play: PlayStation 5, Windows PC, and Xbox Series X

Is Star Wars Jedi: Survivor an Empire Strikes Back level of sequel? Well, no, but it manages to get extraordinarily close to being one of the best follow-ups in the entire Star Wars franchise.

The game improves upon Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order in every conceivable way, with a more entertaining, action-oriented start and a ton of aerial movements and lightsaber stances that make you feel even more like a seasoned Jedi Knight. Quality-of-life improvements like fast travel make the game less frustrating to play, while the new locales packed with hidden collectibles and upgrades make exploration more rewarding.

But what makes Jedi: Survivor truly special isn’t this crude matter, but its luminous heart. You feel it in the memorable characters you meet on your galactic journey, be it the people you help or the friendships you forge and reconcile with. It’s in the classic, crowded cantina where you actually want to go check in with the barkeep. It’s in the tactile, reverent way you craft your lightsaber. And it’s in the kinetic set-pieces that remind you of the serials Star Wars was originally inspired by. At its best, you really can feel the Force around you. —CA

31. Connections

Developer: The New York Times

Where to play: Android, browser, and iOS

After the acquisition of viral hit Wordle, The New York Times’ Crossword ecosystem leveled up to full-fledged attention competitor — NYT is a media company with a gaming platform. And its staff of puzzle writers and editors are not stooping to mind-numbing mobile content to keep the expansion going. Connections, its latest title to pair well with morning coffee, is one of the year’s best games.

Connections offers you a grid of 16 words and a mission: Detect the common threads between four different sets of words without embarrassing yourself. The grouping logic ranges from simple (“animals”) to silly (“synonyms for farting”) to sneaky (“countries when the letter ‘A’ is added”). Gruff game show watchers who claim the puzzle is just a clone of BBC’s long-running Only Connect miss the personality within; Connections writer Wyna Liu brings a tremendous wit to each day’s puzzle, constructing thematic grids and throwing synonym curveballs. And like with Wordle, there’s a sense of accomplishment when you land all four sets — there’s no better start to a day than gloating to friends and family about how you completely nailed Connections. —Matt Patches

30. Hi-Fi Rush

Developer: Tango Gameworks

Where to play: Windows PC and Xbox Series X

In Hi-Fi Rush, you play as Chai, a guy who must escape the factory of a villainous corporation. In a workplace accident, Chai’s iPod gets punched into his chest, making him sensitive to sound and staying on beat. What follows is a joyful action-rhythm game where you explore, climb, and fight to the beat of the music.

The game is a remarkably inviting take on a genre not exactly known for being accessible. But Hi-Fi Rush does away with hardcore precision in exchange for gameplay that always subtly nudges you back toward keeping in time. Failing to attack on a drum stroke doesn’t mean failing a fight; you just don’t get a combo multiplier. And the musical score never gets jarring as a punishment; punchy notes always play in time with the rhythm, even if you hit a button at the wrong time. The result is a game that evokes the thrill of feeling like you’re acing it and getting into a flow, no matter your skill level. —N. Clark

29. Monster Hunter Now

Developer: Niantic

Where to play: Android and iOS

While Niantic’s post-Pokémon Go track record hasn’t been the most consistent, Monster Hunter Now shows the company at its best, with a refined combat system, simple matchmaking, great monster variety, and extensive character upgrades. Granted, those upgrades are part of a monetization setup that gets a little heavy-handed, but if you’re patient, there’s plenty of game here for free. And unlike in some of Niantic’s other games, the real-world elements don’t feel tacked on, with a design that blends almost perfectly with the company’s map tech, allowing you to feel like you’re tracking monsters as you get outside and walk around. It all makes for a big step forward in fusing Niantic’s real-world tech approach with combat and exploration mechanics that can stand up on their own. —Matt Leone

Related Monster Hunter Now is the most traditional Niantic game yet

28. Diablo 4

Developer: Blizzard Entertainment

Where to play: PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Windows PC, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X

With Diablo 4, Blizzard Entertainment set out to marry the frenetic action of Diablo 3, the deep RPG systems of Diablo 2, and the dark tone of the original game. It was an ambitious promise, to be sure, but four years and a whole pandemic after the studio announced the long-awaited sequel at BlizzCon 2019, it’s here, and it’s fantastic.

But Diablo 4’s marriage of tone, action, and role-playing isn’t what makes it so good. In addition to all of those other things, Diablo 4 is the best launch we’ve seen for a new “living game” in recent memory.

With the likes of Destiny, Anthem, and even Diablo 3, it was clear from the start that there were some nuggets of potential. But being a fan meant slogging through mountains of frustration just to taste a morsel of what you’d hope those games would become. Playing these games early on was a kind of gamble.

Diablo 4, however, is unlike any of those projects, because its systems were deep and nuanced from the start, enough to spend hundreds of hours growing your character. And there is already loads of content to support that kind of time investment. —RG

27. Hitman World of Assassination: Freelancer mode

Developer: IO Interactive

Where to play: PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Windows PC, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X

Hitman World of Assassination’s Freelancer mode, which debuted in January and puts a roguelike twist on Agent 47’s globe-trotting murder-for-hire missions, isn’t for the faint of heart. It demands constant improvisation, to a degree that can challenge even veteran Hitman players. Repeated failures can make it feel more frustrating than fun.

But as every fan of roguelikes knows, these high-stakes experiences have the capacity to deliver a sense of exhilaration like nothing else. Pulling off multiple daring kills, hiding the evidence (or going out with a bang), and trying to make it out alive with all the gear you brought into the mission — it’s tense and thrilling, every time.

Every move you make could be your last one; all it takes to ruin a flawless run is a single ill-considered plan, just one seemingly minor slip-up. With the abyss of failure forever yawning beneath 47, playing Hitman Freelancer can feel like tiptoeing along the top of a barbed-wire fence. The exultation of safely making it to the final exfiltration point, having defeated a crime syndicate after completing a lengthy series of dangerous missions, is a high I’ll keep chasing again and again. —Samit Sarkar

26. Venba

Developer: Visai Games

Where to play: Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Windows PC, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X

I don’t love to cook. For me, it’s more a necessity than anything else. So it’s not often that a piece of media — or anything, really — leaves me with the feeling that I need to make something, to spend time in the kitchen reveling in the tedium of chopping and the sizzle of onions frying.

Venba elicited that urge, reminding me that food is not just something to keep me alive, but something to be cherished. Venba is a cooking game that focuses on an immigrant family that’s moved from India to Canada. Food transcends the story by way of simple cooking minigames as I move through the chapters of main character Venba’s life — moments that switch between painful and heartwarming. Venba packs as much heart in its one-hour playtime as games 30 times its size. —N. Carpenter

25. Viewfinder

Developer: Sad Owl Studios

Where to play: PlayStation 5 and Windows PC

At the heart of Viewfinder is a magic trick that never gets old: You take a photo of the environment and paste that perspective into the game world to create a bridge or reveal a needed trinket. The experience of seeing reality distorted by your hands so easily is nearly on the level of thinking with Portals for the first time. You’ll ponder a solution for minutes, sure it’s impossible and that the developers must have made a mistake, before you’re struck by a eureka moment like a lightning bolt.

The game’s lesson on perspective extends to its narrative, which, much like the photos you use to manipulate the world, contains multitudes. Though it’s told in fairly typical video game-y audio monologues that you uncover from the game’s trippy environments, the journey is powerful and topical. Just as differing perspectives can allow for unique solutions, they can also obscure truths that lead us to deny the reality that’s right in front of us. —CA

24. Humanity

Developer: tha

Where to play: PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, and Windows PC

Humanity looks like a modern art project, recalls memories of early PlayStation oddity, and comes (in part) from the team behind game of the future Rez Infinite. But its most impressive feat is the way it gradually shifts genres, starting as a classic puzzle game, then taking on tower defense and shoot-’em-up traits as it evolves into an all-out war. Think Braveheart, with a shiba inu general leading a troop of faceless, brainless low-polygon figures against a group of angry, lightsaber-wielding, even lower-polygon foes. It’s the kind of design subtlety that stays in its lane yet builds on you, and before you realize it, ends very differently than it began. Much like humanity itself? —ML

23. Paranormasight: The Seven Mysteries of Honjo

Developer: Square Enix

Where to play: Android, iOS, Nintendo Switch, and Windows PC

Square Enix has plenty of mega-franchises to fill its time (and its coffers). This year, we have new entries for Octopath Traveler and Final Fantasy, along with new Dragon Quest and Kingdom Hearts games in the not-so-distant future. Dayenu!

And yet, the publisher can’t help itself from bombarding us with surprising, interesting, sometimes great, often good-enough experiments. In 2022, we got an English-language remake of lost gem Live A Live, the surprisingly enjoyable tactical RPG DioField Chronicle, a bonkers Final Fantasy spinoff featuring the musical stylings of Limp Bizkit, and a pair of oddball card games lathered in lore from gaming’s best weirdo. This year, we have the Avengers of rhythm games, Theatrhythm Final Bar Line, and Paranormasight: The Seven Mysteries of Honjo, an excellent riff on the visual novel penned by a beloved storyteller — whose best series has never appeared in the U.S.

What should you know about Paranormasight before you play? Well, ideally nothing. Why else would I be eating up my word count?

But if you insist: It’s a mystery — and a horror mystery at that. You travel to 1980s Japan, specifically the Tokyo neighborhood of Honjo, located not so far from the modern Tokyo Skytree. It’s hard to imagine that modern landmark ever towering alongside these streets, which are filled with shadows and lethal curses.

If you have even a passing interest in urban legends, spooky folklore, cults, and deadly rituals, or you’ve enjoyed series like Zero Escape and Danganronpa, Paranormasight is an easy recommendation. And if you just enjoy a good yarn and have access to basically any screen and $15, then you’re a perfect mark too. It runs as well on console and PC as it does on iOS and Android, so don’t fret about where you play, just do so and soon! Before Square Enix stops investing in all these oddities. —Chris Plante

22. Marvel’s Midnight Suns

Developer: Firaxis Games

Where to play: Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Windows PC, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X

[Ed. note: Marvel’s Midnight Suns was released in 2022, but it just barely missed the cutoff for our best video games of 2022 list, so it’s eligible for our 2023 awards.]

I know what you’re thinking: Another licensed Marvel game? Come on, right? But hear me out. I played Marvel’s Avengers, too, and this isn’t that. It might seem like it’s going to be at first, because Midnight Suns makes the grave error of introducing Iron Man and Doctor Strange as its tutorial characters, and these two might just be the most irritating characters in the entire video game. (I have beaten the game, so I am allowed to make this call.) You must press on and give Midnight Suns time to win you over. Because it has so, so much more to offer than it may appear in its first few hours.

Picture the romance and humor of Fire Emblem: Three Houses, combined with the high-stakes tactical battles of XCOM 2 — that’s what Midnight Suns becomes in its mid-game and endgame. It’s a card-based strategy game, and each hero has their own customizable deck. I started off favoring Captain Marvel, Magik, and Blade, simply because their moves and hilarious dialogue kept me entertained, but I soon realized that every single character has something exciting or unexpected to bring to the battlefront. Over 100 hours later, I’ve leveled up every single character and played all the main story missions and an unknowable number of optional missions, and I’m still not sick of this combat… or the kooky cast of characters that grows all the time (shoutout to the Deadpool DLC).

No matter how sick of Marvel you might be, give Midnight Suns the chance to win you over with its clever combat. And once you’ve gotten hooked, you might find yourself sticking around to chuckle at Wolverine attending Blade’s book club (yes, that’s a storyline in this game). It’s worth your time, and you can take that from me, a person who — again — spent over 100 hours on it. —Maddy Myers

21. Honkai: Star Rail

Developer: Hoyoverse

Where to play: Android, iOS, PlayStation 5, and Windows PC

I have been a... pretty die-hard Genshin Impact player since launch. I’ve rolled for every character, grinded out all of said characters, 100%-ed the exploration, completed every quest — did all the stuff that would burn anyone out. Honkai: Star Rail is Hoyoverse’s answer to the Genshin Impact burnout.

The slower-paced turn-based combat, the ability to auto-battle (if your teams are strong enough), and the smaller maps make it the perfect daily game for me to funnel my interest into without feeling exhausted. The characters are fun, flashy, and easy to latch onto. Should I main the sneaky but elegant Kafka, who uses damage-over-time skills to whittle her opponents away? Or should I use the brooding Blade, who unleashes huge attacks at the cost of his HP? Ah, I guess I’ll let my wallet decide — it is a gacha game, after all. —JL

20. Chants of Sennaar

Developer: Rundisc

Where to play: Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, Windows PC, and Xbox One

In Chants of Sennaar you climb up a kind of Tower of Babel, and your job is to decipher the distinct language each group of people speaks, eventually aiming to translate fluidly from one language to another. You do so by matching pictographic symbols — the characters for each language — to images of the nouns, actions, and concepts in a large dictionary-style book.

It sounds complicated, but it’s wonderfully fun because the mechanics are so simple. You explore the isometric world — which is rendered in a gorgeous cel-shaded style — witnessing interactions between cultures and attempting to puzzle out the meaning of their written words. The game parcels out words for you to assign meaning to in little packets, to avoid overwhelming you. By the end, you’ll have translated numerous languages, and scaled your way to the top of the tower. Perhaps you’ll even change the tower itself. —N. Clark

19. Metroid Prime Remastered

Developer: Retro Studios

Where to play: Nintendo Switch

Few games from 2002 hold up as well as Metroid Prime, and the remastered version of the game — which was surprise-dropped during February’s Nintendo Direct — proves that Samus Aran’s first-person adventure is still worth experiencing, whether it’s for the first time or (in my case) the fourth.

Retro Studios’ take on one of sci-fi’s most famous intergalactic bounty hunters controversially took her out of the 2D puzzle-platformer realm that made her famous (although Metroid Fusion also came out in 2002 — a gift for the 2D Metroid purists — which may also be why Fusion joined Nintendo Switch Online’s catalog shortly after Prime Remastered was released). By placing the player inside Samus’ helmet, Metroid Prime recontextualized the bounty hunter’s relationship with the hostile planets around her.

As we donned Samus’ suit and explored strange planets, aggressive alien lifeforms could now get right in our faces, forcing us to dodge, strafe, and roll (in morph ball form, naturally) using all three dimensions. No longer would we sit back and watch as Samus dipped her toe into a pool of lava; in first-person, as molten fire spread over our visor, we’d really feel the pressure to find that Varia Suit upgrade. And perhaps most importantly, from behind Samus’ visor, we gained the ability to scan our enemies and environment, collecting and translating logs from the long-dead Chozo aliens who once inhabited these now-hostile places.

The world of Prime is harsh and unrelenting. (Save points will, at times, be quite far from one another.) But it’s worth buckling down and pushing through the pain points to discover this world’s secrets. —M. Myers

18. Shadow Gambit: The Cursed Crew

Developer: Mimimi Games

Where to play: PlayStation 5, Windows PC, and Xbox Series X

Shadow Gambit: The Cursed Crew may very well be the most bittersweet entry on this list. It is, for my money, one of the best games to be released in 2023. It is also the swan song of Mimimi Games, one of the most underappreciated studios making games throughout the last decade. Mimimi announced its planned closure only two weeks after releasing its final game. This makes The Cursed Crew its swan song. It is also the team’s magnum opus.

Set in a tropical world of zombie pirates, religious fanatics, and talking ships, The Cursed Crew sees you traveling freely across an archipelago as you revive your undead crew, deploy them on dioramic worlds constituting some of the finest level design in video games to date, and dispatching enemies with a mixture of tactical stealth and supernatural abilities. Taken at a distance, this mixture is undeniably niche. But seen up close, The Cursed Crew is as potent a creation as we’ve seen since 2016’s Shadow Tactics: Blades of the Shogun or 2020’s Desperados 3, which respectively established and cemented the studio’s brilliant design chops. I’ll miss Mimimi — but I can’t imagine a better farewell. —M. Mahardy

17. Dredge

Developer: Black Salt Games

Where to play: Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Windows PC, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X

Dredge is a Lovecraftian horror experience masquerading as a simple fishing game.

The open ocean is filled with terrible creatures that can and will damage or destroy your boat. And each of the major islands you visit comes with its own evil sea beasts that must be dealt with if you want to progress the story or fish peacefully. Dredge ultimately tells a dark parable about loss, and how obsession can own you if you aren’t careful.

But what makes Dread so special — and one of the best games of 2023 — is that under its foreboding story and twisted environments is a fishing game that grows more complex with every outing, centered around an upgrade system that feels amazing to progress through. As the dangers around you grow, so too does your ship’s capabilities. And by adventuring into battles — metaphorical and otherwise — with the seas’ most dastardly critters, you’ll always come out on the other side with some upgrades that allow you to catch even better fish and build an even bigger boat.

By the time you’ve spent 10 or so hours with Dredge, you’ll feel like a commercial fisherman who just happened upon something bigger and more foreboding than they could have imagined — and that, perhaps, you’ve stared deep into some kind of black abyss, only to escape forever changed. —RG

Related Dredge invents and perfects the fishing horror genre

16. Final Fantasy 16

Developer: Square Enix

Where to play: PlayStation 5

Final Fantasy 16 kicks ass. The newest mainline entry in the long, winding series takes you on a lavish, unadulterated Game of Thrones-esque adventure. You play as a broody Clive Rosfield, a young man whose life’s work is to protect his little brother, Joshua. The story begins when Clive’s life takes a turn for the worse and he vows to destroy the monster who ruined his and his family’s legacy.

Developed by Creative Business Unit III, Square Enix’s internal team behind the MMORPG Final Fantasy 14, 16 leans into patchwork territories of fantasy genre fare. There is palace intrigue, a whole lot of sex, and endless war between nations. But the developers then sprinkle in Final Fantasy elements like mother crystals, dazzling kaiju fights between summons (known as Eikons in this iteration), and of course, Chocobos.

The quality of the story in this long and linear character-driven RPG waxes and wanes, but the action combat is among the best I’ve ever played. The gameplay grips you from the very beginning as Clive smoothly dashes, parries, and swings his giant sword and varied magic with a dazzling amount of style. The gameplay didn’t just help me stick with the game, but instead allowed my excitement to bubble over every time I took on a new mission. —Ana Diaz

15. Cyberpunk 2077: Phantom Liberty

Developer: CD Projekt Red

Where to play: PlayStation 5, Windows PC, and Xbox Series X

Like the best DLC, Phantom Liberty does as much to expand on the base game as it does to reframe it. Alongside the sweeping Patch 2.0, which revamped Cyberpunk 2077’s role-playing progression systems, improved its enemy AI, and course-corrected a litany of other details, Phantom Liberty also adds a whole new district to the dystopian world of Night City, complete with its own spy-thriller storyline.

The resulting Cyberpunk 2077 is not an entirely different beast than the one that was released in 2020, but it is a more evolved one. It delivers on the promise of building a hacker-samurai in a neon-infused open world replete with futuristic heists, daunting choices, and striking characters. Phantom Liberty and Patch 2.0 may not completely erase the memory of CD Projekt’s initial botched release, but they come pretty damn close. Three years after we first set foot in V’s shoes, Cyberpunk 2077 has finally justified the hype. —M. Mahardy

14. Dead Space

Developer: Motive Studio

Where to play: PlayStation 5, Windows PC, and Xbox Series X

With The Last of Us on HBO and Resident Evil 4 back in the conversation, it’s already a banner year for survival horror. Motive Studio’s Dead Space remake is no exception. Following in the footsteps of Capcom’s aforementioned title, the original Dead Space brought the third-person-action focus of Resident Evil 4’s formula to a deteriorating ship in outer space. In the vein of Event Horizon, Sunshine, and Alien, Dead Space was a paragon for sci-fi horror in a confined and claustrophobic setting. Its remake has brought that same vision to gorgeous new life, bringing quality-of-life changes and underappreciated updates (it has made several previously useless weapons into viable tools in protagonist Isaac Clarke’s arsenal), making it hard to imagine ever going back to Visceral Games’ phenomenal original. —M. Mahardy

Related The Dead Space remake changes all the right things

13. Octopath Traveler 2

Developers: Square Enix, Acquire

Where to play: Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, and Windows PC

The first Octopath Traveler was one of those games that was as enjoyable to play as it was painful: enjoyable because so much of it kicked ass, but painful because so much of it dragged the positive aspects down. In other words, it stood on the precipice of excellence, but couldn’t quite cross the line.

Octopath Traveler 2 leaps across that boundary. In place of the original game’s repetitive level design, monotonous narrative structure, and sometimes awkward characterization, the sequel demonstrates an expert ability to challenge your expectations at every turn. Yes, your general goal is still to recruit eight playable characters (hence the name) and follow each of their separate plot threads to their respective conclusions, participating in turn-based battles and side quests along the way. But said plots vary greatly from character to character, and if you so choose, you can see a handful of characters through several major plot points before recruiting the whole gang. Octopath Traveler 2 finely toes the line between that comfort food-esque repetition of the best JRPGs, and the subversive nature of great genre storytelling. —M. Mahardy

12. Dave the Diver

Developer: Mintrocket

Where to play: Nintendo Switch and Windows PC

You could describe Dave the Diver as a fishing game and a restaurant management simulator, and that’d be correct. But that would also be underselling the game, and understating things quite a lot.

Diving into the mysterious Blue Hole, Dave spends the first two quarters of his day swimming deeper into the colorful abyss, discovering both sea life and a story that’s equally absurd and earnest. When you’re not picking up sea urchins or spearfishing sharks, Dave is assisting the rest of Dave the Diver’s cast of characters — his sushi business partners, a community of seafolk, an anime-obsessed weapons expert, and a pair of dolphins. At night, Dave slings sushi and pours drinks at the restaurant, frantically running back and forth between clearing dishes, delivering sushi, and refilling the freshly ground wasabi. Between all that, Dave’s harvesting rice and vegetables on a farm, curating a hatchery, racing seahorses with mermaids, and taking down a suspicious group masquerading as environmental activists. Somehow, there’s even a well-done rhythm video game — starring one of those anime idols that the arms dealer loves — that makes perfect sense.

It really shouldn’t work; I can’t imagine another game where all these disparate ideas coalesce so seamlessly. But Dave the Diver would feel less complete without any one of them. It makes for such a compelling loop, and a consistent advancement of the game’s story, that I kept finding myself in that “one more day” mindset, eager to jump back into the ocean for one more go. —N. Carpenter

11. Resident Evil 4 Remake

Developer: Capcom

Where to play: PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Windows PC, and Xbox Series X

It turns out, Capcom is good at remaking games.

The original Resident Evil remake all but set the bar for the format in 2002, with sleeker controls, more nuanced graphical details, and whole new areas to explore in the iconic Spencer Mansion. The Resident Evil 2 remake changed the entire perspective of its source material without sacrificing the focus on horror and survival. Resident Evil 3’s remake, as forgettable as it was, still brought the design conceits of the original game, warts and all, to a modern audience. And now we have Resident Evil 4 — and what a remake it is.

In this reimagined version of the 2005 action-survival-horror game, Capcom has managed to erase many of the blemishes on one of the most beloved games in the series, if not all time. The remake is full of new flourishes and extra details in each of its three sprawling areas, making it less of a remake and more of a dramatic reinterpretation. It has also managed to add even more survival elements to the original’s action-centric combat, without sacrificing the camp and cheese that have made it such an enduring presence throughout the years. A lesser game would have shrunk in the face of such intimidating source material, but the Resident Evil 4 remake achieved the balancing act in spades. —M. Mahardy

Top 10

10. Armored Core 6: Fires of Rubicon

Developer: FromSoftware

Where to play: PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Windows PC, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X

Nothing else feels like Armored Core.

The giant robot you pilot heaves with the weight of a six-story building but flies into the sky as nimble as a hummingbird. You can skate along the ground, rocket into the air, and change directions in the blink of an eye. You are agile, resilient, deadly.

With your hands tightly gripping the controller, you can unload four different weapons at once, weapons you’ve picked out of an armory that could rival a small nation. You target, aim, and fire while moving faster than a fighter jet, dodging streams of missiles, arcs of gunfire, bazookas, and flames.

There have been many, many games in the franchise, but none have reached the heights of Armored Core 6: Fires of Rubicon. The levels have never had such ruined beauty, the enemies have never been as satisfying to fight, and the characters have never been more endearing. An ingenious new game plus mode packs the game’s story with surprises while you continue to build out your arsenal.

Perhaps the decades-long wait for a new Armored Core game is part of the reason, because the lessons FromSoftware learned creating and popularizing Dark Souls are evident here. Bosses now put you through dastardly skill checks in classic Soulsian fashion. Many of them tower over the landscape, making you, the pilot of a giant robot, feel small. These set-piece fights are some of the most thrilling moments you could play in a game this year. They certainly have some of the most memorable lines.

But Armored Core 6 doesn’t just get badass one-liners stuck in your head; its gameplay lingers, too. When you watch videos of it in motion, it simply makes you want to play it, to feel that movement, that motion, for yourself.

This isn’t just because the series’ energetic action is unique, but because you decide exactly how your robot feels: how quickly its missiles get a lock, how fast its generator recharges, how far you boost when you swing your laser sword. Swapping components around as you scrutinize competing weight and power requirements is an engaging puzzle all its own. You become intimately familiar with a screen-filling spreadsheet of stats because all of those numbers add up to something that feels real. Tactile. Earned.

Because nothing else feels like Armored Core. —CA

9. Jusant

Developer: Don’t Nod

Where to play: PlayStation 5, Windows PC, and Xbox Series X

Boulderers, or rock climbers who don’t use safety gear but also don’t ascend very high, have a word for the routes they climb: problems. The idea is that, since you’re never that far from flat ground, completing your route is more a game of mind over matter. You don’t “finish” a problem. You “solve” it. Like a puzzle.

When it comes to rock climbing, Jusant just gets it in a way few other games — if any — have.

To be clear, Don’t Nod’s Jusant isn’t technically about bouldering. (A climbing game where you’re never more than 12 feet off the ground would have precisely zero stakes.) But it’s an apt conduit for the spirit of bouldering, in that every route you traverse is a problem to solve. By alternating triggers to dictate which hand goes on which handhold, you navigate these problems. Environmental hazards and a pesky stamina wheel make things progressively trickier. You’re always clear on your heading. (It’s up.) Figuring out how to get there is another matter.

Even in games that prominently feature it, climbing is often functional, at best — whether it’s Link refusing to acknowledge handholds are a thing or Nathan Drake snapping to ledges with a level of magnetism only thought possible at CERN.

Jusant is the first and only game I’ve played that gets it — that sees the inherent grace in the sport and portrays it on the screen, not as a means of getting somewhere, but as the reason to go there in the first place. —Ari Notis

8. Marvel’s Spider-Man 2

Developer: Insomniac Games

Where to play: PlayStation 5

Marvel’s Spider-Man 2 builds on the successes of the first game, both narratively and in its immensely satisfying gameplay. The game’s story takes a familiar Spider-Man narrative — that of friends turned foes — and adds new twists, building out compelling villains (and demanding ones) in the process. The game also sheds its predecessor’s odious Spider-Cop bits in favor of establishing a deeper connection between the Spider-Mans and their city, giving the game room to breathe while further immersing you in its heroes’ worlds and struggles.

And then there’s the gameplay. For my money, there are few experiences more enjoyable in gaming than swinging around New York City with Spider-Man. It was fun in the early 2000s, and it’s still fun now. And with a bigger map to explore (and wings to fly, if you so choose to use them), there’s basically no limit to the fun you can get up to. The deployment of two protagonists is seamless — Peter and Miles play differently, bringing their own stories and desires to the table — and switching between them is effortless. It’s also the rare open-world game that doesn’t feel bloated with missions and side quests, instead leaving you wanting more Spider adventures. —PV

7. Street Fighter 6

Developer: Capcom

Where to play: PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Windows PC, and Xbox Series X

After getting knocked down — by a self-inflicted punch, no less — with the feeble Street Fighter 5, Capcom has hit the gym and returned stronger than before with Street Fighter 6. We rightfully called its latest Street Fighter the “ultimate fighting game toolbox” in Polygon’s review; from a robust single-player mode to solid online modes to a cast of memorable new and returning World Warriors, Street Fighter 6 is Capcom at its most confident.

For newcomers and the lapsed Street Fighter fan wary of jumping into online play, Capcom delivered World Tour mode, a robust, single-player, RPG-lite beat-’em-up in the vein of Sega’s Yakuza games. In World Tour, players hit the streets of Metro City where, hilariously, everyone in town not only knows how to fight, but relishes impromptu fisticuffs with strangers. It’s a matter of local pride.

The streets of Metro City are part training grounds, part beginning of a silly, epic worldwide adventure where you learn the basics of Street Fighter 6. Untethered from any serious game narrative canon, Street Fighter 6 lets players of all skill levels and stripes have fun in World Tour mode.

Street Fighter 6’s approachability extends to its innovative new control scheme, an addition called Modern Controls. While the six-button layout from the very first Street Fighter is still available, after multiple attempts at giving players a simplified control scheme, Capcom’s finally cracked it. Modern Controls are not only comparatively easy to grasp — they’re pretty viable competitively.

But it’s the finely honed one-on-one fighting mechanics, governed by a streamlined set of meters and flashy new moves, that give Street Fighter 6 its longevity. Thanks to a well-populated social space called the Battle Hub, and a rock-solid online infrastructure, there’s a robust community of other Street Fighter fans to battle against on a daily basis. Add a compelling new roster of characters led by classics like Ryu, Zangief, and Chun-Li, and dazzling newcomers Marisa, Manon, and Kimberly, and it’s clear why Street Fighter 6 is one of the best games of 2023, regardless of genre. —Michael McWhertor

6. Cocoon

Developer: Geometric Interactive

Where to play: Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Windows PC, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X

I think I’m still trying to wrap my head around Cocoon. On the surface, the game appears to have a relatively simple premise: You play as a buglike creature that picks up and places glowing orbs to solve puzzles. However, this is where Cocoon hides its brilliant twist. Each orb functions like a world unto itself, which you can explore, or from which you can extract a new power for your bug. As you collect orbs, you thread together puzzles that will have you weaving in and out of realms in a truly mind-bending experience.

Created by Geometric Interactive, a studio founded by developers who previously worked on Limbo and Inside, Cocoon’s brain teasers unfold in a dark sci-fi world. The game goes light on a story that combines biological and mechanical philosophies alike. As you make your way through, you’ll hear the hum of engines and the moist squishy sounds of unknown creatures’ moving flesh.

Cocoon has one-off puzzles that are downright brilliant, but what makes it truly great is the sum of its parts. The pacing of each section feeds smoothly from one challenge to the next. Like the best puzzle games, Cocoon presents instances where an earlier brain teaser might serve as an unsaid tutorial that teaches you a step for a later, more complicated puzzle. Cocoon presents challenges, but it’s also just a joy to play. It is one of the most memorable puzzle games I’ve ever played. —AD

5. Pikmin 4

Developers: Nintendo EPD, Eighting

Where to play: Nintendo Switch

Pikmin 4 is like the perfect amalgamation of Pikmin games. There are fun mini-dungeon caverns, but they’re not filled with terrible bomb traps. There’s new types of Pikmin, but not at the cost of getting rid of the old ones. And there’s a dog now, and he helps corral the Pikmin and make operations run even more efficiently.

The entirety of the game is a whimsical joy to play. Even as I completed every Dandori Challenge (which actually got pretty damn hard!) and collected every item, it never became a drag or a grind. It actually might be impossible to be angry while playing this game. Hearing the little Pikmin hum as they carry a huge peach (that they call a “mock bottom”) across the map is enough to melt anyone’s heart. In fact, I was pretty sad when the game ended. I could command these little guys and my puppy friend to collect things forever.

All told, the game is beautiful, and, thanks to its quasi real-world setting, it makes me see my own world differently — there’s something special to be found everywhere, even in the tiniest corners. Maybe all my little trinkets go missing because a little guy needs it to return home. He can have it.

Even if you’ve never played a Pikmin game before, this game is good, and it’s the perfect place to start. (And then you can play all the rest of them, which have been conveniently ported to the Switch!) —JL

4. Super Mario Bros. Wonder

Developer: Nintendo EPD

Where to play: Nintendo Switch

When you activate Super Mario. Bros. Wonder’s delightful whimsy — via the aptly named Wonder Flower — the game becomes more than a 2D platformer. Super Mario Bros. Wonder is a musical, a quiz show, a race, or a hidden object game. Pipes become inchworms, Piranha Plants burst into song, and Yoshi becomes a goddamn dragon. Wonder is the first side-scrolling 2D platformer in the Super Mario Bros. line since New Super Mario Bros. U in 2012, and it’s both a faithful rendition of the classic format and a complete reinvention of the series’ irresistible formula.

Each and every level in Super Mario Bros. Wonder finds some new way to delight and surprise. It’s constantly introducing new ideas, enemies, and wrinkles, only to pull back on them just when it’s on the verge of becoming rote. Like everything else in the Flower Kingdom, a few enemies shift and change in bizarre ways when the Wonder Flower is activated, like Hoppo, the bouncy, round hippo equivalent that grows in size to create chaos in one of Super Mario Bros. Wonder’s many mesmerizing levels.

All of this weirdness, combined with Nintendo’s platforming expertise, makes Super Mario Bros. Wonder an entrancing romp alone, with friends, or with strangers online. This is the freshest Mario has felt in decades, and it bodes well for the iconic plumber’s 2D future. —N. Carpenter

3. Alan Wake 2

Developer: Remedy Entertainment

Where to play: PlayStation 5, Windows PC, and Xbox Series X

There’s a body in the forest with a hole in its chest. The forest, like the body, is also missing its heart, and a woman must find both. In each, there are pages. This is a story, broken into pieces, we learn. One that ended badly before. One that will likely end badly again. Will you still put it together?

Alan Wake 2 is full of words but few are in order. It is set in places of confused geography, full of people who don’t quite belong, in rooms that might be different each time you enter them. Alan Wake 2 is wrong, and you must make it right, if you can.

Remedy Entertainment’s assured masterpiece is less about stories and more about dreams — the way they can slip from frightening to absurd at a moment’s notice, about how we can get lost in them, learning from our experiences or succumbing to insecurities. How video games can mimic their shape, or lack thereof.

It is about repetition, and the way we find meaning in stories and people and places by returning to them over and over, wondering if we changed or they did.

In Alan Wake 2, everyone’s story is happening at once, branching out in endless directions, and we might not know the genre until it’s too late. It’s a hypertext mystery, an ergodic game that molds itself to an audience raised online, though few computers are in sight. It’s a game for a world suspended in an endless second act — forever wars, live services, franchises, infinite scrolls — endlessly searching for a conclusion. —JR

2. Baldur’s Gate 3

Developer: Larian Studios

Where to play: PlayStation 5 and Windows PC

Baldur’s Gate 3 hit at the perfect moment. Despite the handful of truly great computer role-playing games that have been released since the early 2000s (Larian Studios itself made waves with its Divinity: Original Sin series in 2014 and 2017), the genre has largely remained a modern niche. But times have changed: Dungeons & Dragons has undergone something of a renaissance, thanks to actual-play series like Critical Role and Dimension 20. What’s more, Larian had two years of player feedback with which to build its new masterpiece. That masterpiece launched in August, and it garnered the kind of attention that catapults a game from niche interests to widespread acclaim.

Old CRPG fans finally came home, the Mass Effect generation has discovered a new kind of RPG to sink its teeth into, and D&D fans have found an exceptional digital version of their beloved tabletop game to play alone or with their party in co-op.

Like a good DM, Baldur’s Gate 3 teases out story beats that feel personal to you, cleverly luring you into experiences that seem like they wouldn’t make sense in anyone else’s campaign. Every act delivers quiet, memorable character moments and anxiety-inducing battles. All of these situations feel organic, allowing Baldur’s Gate 3 to replicate, perhaps as closely as a video game can, Dungeons & Dragons’ best feature: the intoxicating sense that anything could happen at any moment.

The best games this year told their stories in interesting ways, be it ignoring your superpowers to bike through your old neighborhood in Queens, a musical number, or fractured memories hidden in a puddle. But Baldur’s Gate 3 takes experimental storytelling to another level. Every choice and every new direction is a simple success, fail, or crit away. One roll of the dice after another can take you all the way from a crashed Nautiloid to the city of Baldur’s Gate itself.

In a year filled with beautiful stories and powerful moments, it’s the spinning whir of Baldur’s Gate 3’s d20 that defined video game storytelling in 2023. —RG

1. The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom

Developer: Nintendo EPD

Where to play: Nintendo Switch

Princess Zelda is missing. Ganondorf has returned, somehow, and he’s really hot. So an age-old hero in a green tunic has to step in. We all know the beats — how could you possibly make that into anything new?

Tears of the Kingdom definitely didn’t seem like it was poised to make that happen: a sequel to one of the most popular Zelda games ever made, originally conceived as DLC, and built on the same map. Yet, it is something else entirely. It’s not just that Breath of the Wild was a rough draft for Tears of the Kingdom — it’s that the entire Zelda series was a collection of stepping stones that led in winding, influential pathways to this wacky, wonderful, and thoroughly new world of Hyrule.

I mean, Ultrahand alone. Just absolutely slathering pieces of wood in what amounts to magical Gorilla Glue and watching in wonder as the game’s physics engine roars to life in response. I went into Tears of the Kingdom thinking I wouldn’t build much — I’d just follow the story and get through it; I left feeling like a genius engineer, building all manner of bizarre contraptions (but mostly long bridges) to sail through skies and trundle over mountaintops.

I still catch my breath remembering that first time diving deep into the darkness of the Depths — the amazement I felt upon discovering a whole other world underneath the one I knew, filled with skeleton horses and gloom-splattered Bokoblins.

And I remember when I realized where Princess Zelda really was… and then, many hours later, learning where she really was.

I never wanted to stop playing Tears of the Kingdom. I did stop, eventually — the year of 2023 in video games has spoiled us all with hearty meals and sweet desserts — but I never stopped thinking about it. Every now and then, I picked my Switch back up to seek out another Lightroot, or solve another shrine’s puzzle, until there were none left. And then I’d just wander, collecting ingredients, talking to Great Fairies, imagining the next adventure.

Tears of the Kingdom feels like someone holding my hands very close as they lean in to whisper, with eyes twinkling, “Can I tell you something?” The ride was wild; I laughed, I cried. And I can’t wait for the next time, when it’s completely different. —M. Myers",The best video games of the year so far,https://www.polygon.com/23648669/best-video-games-2023,Polygon

Got it Normal text size Larger text size Very large text size It was 16 years ago that horror filmmaker Eli Roth first introduced the world to his slasher vision Thanksgiving (tagline: “There will be no leftovers”), inspired by the seasonal horror films of his ’70s and ’80s youth such as Halloween (1978), My Bloody Valentine (1981) and Silent Night, Deadly Night (1984). That was as a spoof movie trailer in the middle of Grindhouse, Quentin Tarantino and Robert Rodriguez’s pulpy 2007 double-feature, where an axe-wielding pilgrim wreaked havoc on lusty teenagers around the backwoods of Plymouth, Massachusetts. “[Co-writer] Jeff Rendell and I, we grew up in Massachusetts, which is the birthplace of Thanksgiving; it’s a huge deal there and in school it’s really shoved down your throat – you go to these pilgrim recreation villages, there’s a school play, a parade…” Roth explains. “So growing up we always thought, ‘Why isn’t there a Thanksgiving slasher film?’ Grindhouse gave us the opportunity to try out all the kills we’d already had floating around in our heads.” A pilgrim-inspired killer terrorises Plymouth, Massachusetts in Thanksgiving – his name is John Carver. Over the years, the resulting trailer – campy and explicit and horrific as it was – came to be touted by genre aficionados as “the best horror movie never made”. Well, until now. “It’s really down to the fans, badgering me year after year,” Roth jokes of how Thanksgiving came to be a real movie. “Guilt-tripping and shaming me, it really works.” In a metatextual flip that cheekily ribs Hollywood’s predictability, this Thanksgiving is framed as a modern-day reboot of the lost slasher film that was featured in the fake movie trailer. There’s a killer on the loose in modern-day Plymouth, and he’s got an axe, a wrath and a creepy mask of the first US settlement’s first governor. Wonderfully, his name was John Carver. “I mean, when history hands you a gift like that, how do you not use it?” jokes Roth. “It’s a perfect slasher villain name and he was real, the governor on the Mayflower!” Despite Thanksgiving Day’s heavy baggage (like Australia Day, many in the US have increasingly questioned the holiday’s ties to colonial aggression), the film’s key creative breakthrough for Roth and Rendell came from something decidedly more contemporary: watching online “trample videos” from Black Friday shopping sales, traditionally held the day after Thanksgiving, that started proliferating on social media around a decade ago with news reports and clips of shoppers in a consumerist frenzy. “These Black Friday sales, they were never a thing when I was a kid. But now I know they’re even in Australia, they’re everywhere,” says Roth, who saw fertile horror territory in the holiday’s materialistic shift. “The whole idea of Thanksgiving is you’re supposed to be thankful for what you have and for your health, but then you just go out and kill your neighbour for a waffle iron.”

Advertisement

That idea gives the film its raucous opening, what might be the most horribly enjoyable 13 minutes of a film all year – a sick and clever movement that launches the film’s action amid the craze of a Black Friday sale. In the great tradition of seasonal horror classics, the move lets Roth critique the gross commercialisation of the holiday, tap into our era’s increasingly stoked class divisions, and evoke the horror genre’s rich legacy: the hordes of rampaging shoppers rushing the shopping mall feel like a direct nod to George Romero’s classic anti-capitalist screed, Dawn of the Dead (1978). Gina Gershon and Patrick Dempsey in Thanksgiving. “I love Dawn of the Dead, zombies running the mall, and very much in line with Romero’s views on consumerism run amok. That’s what it’s all about. There’s a real darkness underneath it and it’s not just people’s greed that’s behind [the frenzy of these] Black Friday sales,” says Roth. “People are paid shit now so there’s no middle class any more so they desperately need these Black Friday sales in order to get all the Christmas gifts for their kids, otherwise they can’t afford them. So then you have the very few at the top sitting in their mansions watching all the rats fighting over these crumbs, and there’s something really sick about that, that everyone’s been reduced to fighting for televisions and electronics because the only way they can afford them is on this one sale day, while the few at the top get richer and richer.” Horror, the genre – even among films built on flimsier precepts than Thanksgiving – has a long history of reflecting the tumult and anxieties of the wider culture in which they were created. The opening scenes of crazed shoppers pressed up against the jagged glass of the mall also evokes images from the US’s January 6 riots, while later scenes in which armed school students are anxiously and awkwardly forced to defend themselves against a crazed killer feel like they’re engaging with the US’s feverish gun control rhetoric. When I question Roth about the symbolism, he spiritually, if not literally, rolls his eyes. Director Eli Roth sees franchise potential in his remarkably fun new slasher flick. “Look, I want it to be where we’re in the world of the movie, we’re not in the real world. I want people to escape into a rollercoaster ride and have a fun time with the movie. But certainly, if you want to write a film school thesis about it, everything’s there,” he says. For such a horror tragic, the first goal is always “great kills”.

“Every time I make a horror movie, it’s like a badge of honour for me,” says Roth. “It’s like, this is my chance to make a slasher film, you know? I grew up with Freddie, Jason, Michael Myers, Chucky – I loved those movies so much – and in the ’90s, we had Ghostface and other slashers that were overlooked, like Mute Witness (1995) which is one of my favourites. I just thought, well, it’s time for a new slasher. I want a new killer in town, so let’s create another one.” Roth has been horror’s most provocative maestro for decades now, a filmmaker who finds a sinister glee in pushing the envelope – it was his film Hostel (2005), after all, that spawned the term “torture porn”. In a weak glimmer at the back of my mind, I vaguely remember attending a Q&A screening for Cabin Fever (2002), Roth’s then feature debut, at Glebe’s now defunct Valhalla cinema about 20 years ago. “Oh, I remember that,” Roth recalls. “I remember a kid coming up to me after, with his friend Angus, and we talked for half an hour about how much he loved the movie. And I was doing Angus’ radio show the next day and that kid came up to me again and he’s like, ‘Yeah, I made a short film called Saw.’ It was Leigh Whannell.” (L to R) Tomaso Sanelli, Nell Verlaque, Addison Rae, Gabriel Davenport and Jenna Warren, in trouble in Thanksgiving. Roth has since helmed over 20 films as a director, more than double as a producer, and also appeared onscreen – notably as Sgt. Donny “The Bear Jew” Donowitz in Quentin Tarantino’s Inglourious Basterds (2009) and most recently in this year’s comically maligned The Idol, where he played a wracked Live Nation rep. While he wasn’t involved in the show’s troubled first incarnation, Roth says he enjoyed his experience on creator Sam Levinson’s set. “You saw this negative stuff come up [in the press] and I’d be thinking, ‘What are people talking about?’” he says. He completed The Idol right before he went into directing Thanksgiving, and credits the experience with “switching up my brain to use another side of my creativity”. “I think that’s why I really am an actor’s director and why actors like working with me, is that they know I understand what they go through,” he says. “In the rehearsal process with the cast, or getting ready to do a scare scene, I want to give them the room to go off-script a bit until we find something interesting, and that’s all from my personal experience as an actor.”

entertainment,,2023-10-19T17:22:01+00:00,"Robin Williams' sudden death shocked the world in 2014, and now his friends and colleagues are giving an inside look into the years before he died by suicide.

The depth of Williams' drug use was highlighted in Vice's ""The Dark Side of Comedy"" documentary series. The comedian's episode marked the premiere of the show's second season.

Williams began his career in stand-up comedy in the 1970s and elevated his fame after appearing in an episode of ""Happy Days"" as an alien named Mork. The role led to his own TV series, ""Mork and Mindy."" The comedian also landed a role in the film world with ""Popeye.""

Williams' friends noted that while he loved being around people, he also ""cherished"" his alone time, and they began to see him struggle with his level of fame.

STARS WE'VE LOST IN 2023

""Robin's highs were so high and his lows were often low,"" his ""Mork and Mindy"" co-star Gina Hecht said during the documentary.

Due to Williams' high-energy performance onstage, many speculated that the comedian had turned to cocaine, with some saying they would see the actor head to the back of The Comedy Store, where drugs were prevalent.

Williams' longtime friend Allan Stephan recalled a moment that led him to worry.

""He said, ‘Know anybody with any blow? I have to go on. I can’t go on without the blow.’ And I sat down and said, ‘I’m going to help you,'"" Stephan claimed. ""He goes, ‘You have blow?’ I go, ‘No, are you out of your f---ing mind? You’re Robin Williams!’

""And then I think after that he wouldn't get high when he had to perform.""

However, Williams continued to do drugs after his stand-up shows.

""When you did have that kind of fame, drugs were just given to you,"" Hecht noted.

ROBIN WILLIAMS' KIDS PAY TRIBUTE TO THE LATE ACTOR ON WHAT WOULD'VE BEEN HIS 72ND BIRTHDAY: ‘LOVE YOU FOREVER’

Filmmaker and comedian Mike Binder recalled Williams' reaction to ""a gram of coke"" while the two were out in Hollywood in the '80s.

""Robin said, ‘Let me take that. Do you mind if I grab a hit off that in the bathroom?’"" Binder recalled in the documentary. ""He came back, and it was empty. It was like, ‘Whoa.’ It was like 8:15 at night.""

""It was an accident, I'm sorry,"" Binder said the comedian responded after being called out for taking the entire gram.

""With drugs, he was a monster.""

Williams began to weave cocaine into his stand-up jokes — which many laughed at, despite the light it shed on how deep the comedian was into his cocaine use.

""I can't tell you how many times Robin came onstage at The Comedy Store and a big part of his routine was cocaine and the drugs that he had done,"" Howie Mandel recalled. ""And even though everybody was laughing, and it was really funny, he was really doing a lot of cocaine. He found the funny side of it, but ultimately it was real and really, it's not funny, but that's who he is.""

John Belushi's death in 1982 ""threw cold water"" on Williams, who had been close to the comedian. Belushi died from a drug overdose in a bungalow at the Chateau Marmont hotel in West Hollywood, California.

Belushi's death, along with the birth of Williams' first son in 1983, really helped the comedian clean up his drug addiction, according to the documentary.

Williams quit cocaine ""cold turkey,"" his longtime friend Stanley Wilson said.

""He knew what an amazing instrument that he had, and that it is all related to his mind and his imagination and his wit,"" Wilson added. ""The more stuff you do to deaden that, the more you’re going to burn some more brain cells. Robin didn’t want to do that.""

Once he quit, Williams' career continued to grow — with him landing a show at The Met and other movie roles, including ""Mrs. Doubtfire,"" ""Good Will Hunting"" and ""Night at the Museum.""

However, in the years before his death in 2014, the actor was unaware he was dealing with Lewy body dementia. Williams reportedly appeared tired while on set and didn't seem to be his usual self before he died by suicide on Aug. 11, 2014.

The comedian was diagnosed with the neurological disorder posthumously after an autopsy was performed. Lewy body dementia is the second most common type of dementia after Alzheimer's. The disease affects brain regions involved in thinking, memory and movement, according to the Mayo Clinic.

The autopsy found no illegal drugs or traces of alcohol in Williams' system.

""The last time I saw Robin Williams, I hadn’t seen him for a few months, and he was thin, and he didn’t recognize my wife,"" Steven Pearl, a comedian and friend, said during the documentary. ""He hardly said a word. It took him a second to recognize me. I go, ‘Whoa, something’s wrong here.’ I didn't know what. Nobody would really tell me. And then I never saw him again after that.""

entertainment,Cameron Faulkner,2023-11-17T13:15:48+00:00,"Your time — and money — is precious. Polygon’s What to Buy has rounded up the best in gaming hardware, entertainment, tabletop, merch, and toys, and how to get them for the best value, so you spend less time shopping and more time enjoying.

Finding the best controller for playing PC games is a more personal journey than it sounds. It’s got to be comfortable to use, with every button, stick, and trigger easily in reach. It’s also important that you’re getting the features you want. For example, those might include easy setup on PC, good battery life, multi-platform compatibility, and accessibility options, like the ability to remap buttons and adjust stick or trigger sensitivity.

At Polygon, we play games on a lot of consoles and platforms — both new and old. Our staff has a wide variety of preferences and needs. We’ve come together to share our favorite PC-ready controllers.

Microsoft Xbox controller

On the Polygon team, the Xbox controller got the highest number of endorsements of any controller. This speaks to its comfort and value, and that Microsoft has released enough colors to satisfy varying tastes in design. It also helps that it’s usually around $50 (depending on the color), and that it just works with most PC games. Regardless of the Windows PC game client, there are no extra steps for setting it up.

This controller is a refined version of Microsoft’s Xbox One wireless model, with added texture around its grips, plus a capture button in the middle. It can, of course, connect to Xbox consoles, and to PCs that have Bluetooth. One universally positive change from the older version is that, if you want to connect via a cable for wired play, its connector port is the more ubiquitous USB-C instead of Micro USB. It also has a 3.5mm headphone jack for private listening, though it can only be used if your controller is wired into your PC, not wirelessly.

“The Xbox wireless controller just works for me — it fits right in my hands, the texture feels just right, and it’s not too heavy” —Nicole Carpenter

Beyond PC compatibility, the Xbox controller boasts native compatibility on Steam Deck, plus recent versions of Android and iOS. So, whether you have a phone or tablet, this controller can easily connect via Bluetooth. A growing number of mobile games support it, too, and it works like a charm with the Xbox Game Pass game streaming app.

It can work on even more platforms if you purchase 8BitDo’s clever $19.99 USB Adapter 2. With it, you can use the Xbox controller on your Nintendo Switch. In addition to Switch support, this USB adapter lets you easily connect your Xbox controller to other devices, like Mac, Raspberry Pi, and more.

The biggest downside to the Xbox controller might not bother you: It requires two AA batteries, though on a positive note, the battery life is around the 40-hour range, depending on usage. If you don’t want to change out batteries, we recommend this $44.99 8BitDo dual controller charging dock, which includes two rechargeable battery packs, enough for two controllers.

Microsoft’s Xbox Elite Series 2 builds on the excellent foundation of Microsoft’s Xbox controller with features that enthusiast gamers may appreciate. It features swappable stick caps and directional pads, adjustable tension for its analog sticks, and customizable back paddles. It also ships in a nice zip-up case. If you want more buttons and tweakable settings in a controller, this might be worth its $178.99 price. This model is compatible with Xbox and PC.

If you don’t need all of the extra accessories that come with the Elite Series 2, Microsoft makes a cheaper Elite Series 2 Core. If you decide later on that you want the paddles, zip-up case, and swappable sticks, you can buy this third-party kit on Amazon for $22.99.

Sony DualSense controller

There’s another slice of our staff who swear by Sony’s DualSense, a modern controller that retains the symmetrical analog stick arrangement that PlayStation controllers are known for. Compared directly to the Xbox controller, the DualSense has similar levels of compatibility (both are compatible with Android and iOS, and feature built-in Bluetooth for support on PC). However, the DualSense does have key differences, as well as a few perks that help to justify its higher $69.99 price.

In terms of using the DualSense on a PC, it’s possible to do, but it’s a little complicated. It can connect via Bluetooth for a wireless connection, but games that don’t support the DirectInput controller API likely won’t recognize it as a controller. Plugging the controller into your PC might solve that issue, but there are other ways to get around this barrier if playing wirelessly is important to you.

One is to rely on Steam, which supports the DualSense controller with its SteamInput API. That makes Sony’s controller a first-class citizen in the eyes of Steam, right next to the Xbox controller, and plenty of games should offer no-fuss DualSense support.

If you have PC games that you want to play on other services, like PC Game Pass, Epic Games Store, and more, you might experience some middling compatibility with the DualSense. However, adding them as a “non-Steam game” within Steam can solve for this. To do this, click the “Add a Game” option in the bottom left corner of the Steam client, then find the executable file (.exe) in your storage.

“I like the PS5 DualSense because it’s incredibly precise — using it, after coming from previous gen controllers, felt like putting on glasses and seeing the world come into focus” —Nicole Clark

To get around using Steam entirely, you can download an app called DS4Windows along with some drivers, which ensures game compatibility on PC by emulating the DualSense as an Xbox controller. The app gives you a host of settings to customize the DualSense’s button mapping, if you wish. And, in case you want to go down the rabbit hole of figuring out which PC games support the DualSense’s haptics and adaptive trigger features (and the steps to getting them to work), the site PCGamingWiki has you covered.

Related Here are the best PS5 accessories

The DualSense is the official controller for the PS5. In games that support its features, it can have realistic-feeling haptic feedback and gyroscopic motion controls, and its triggers can provide tension to make certain actions feel more realistic. There’s no better controller for the PS5 than this one. It’s a good controller for using PS Remote Play, too. When it’s connected to an Android device for a PS Remote Play session, the DualSense supports adaptive triggers in games that take advantage of the feature.

8BitDo’s $19.99 USB Adapter 2 also works perfectly with the DualSense, letting you play games on your Switch with it once it’s paired. I preferred to play Splatoon 3 with my PS5 controller’s analog stick arrangement. Heck, it even supports gyroscopic camera movement, just like the official Switch controllers.

Just like Microsoft, Sony also has its own pro-grade controller. It’s the $199.99 DualSense Edge, which is compatible with the PS5. It’s tempting to call out its similarities to the Xbox Elite Series 2, of which there are plenty, but it’s more helpful to speak about how it differs. For one, its stick modules can be replaced entirely — a move that makes the DualSense Edge a little more user-repairable. Also, the PS5’s interface for the Edge is intuitive, and it makes remapping controls and setting schemes the breeze that it should be.

While the Edge is compatible on PC, Sony and Steam haven’t developed drivers that let gamers take full advantage of its back paddles and swappable control schemes.

Nintendo Switch Pro controller

The Switch Pro controller is another staff favorite. If it’s a great Nintendo Switch and PC controller you’re after, this is the pinnacle in terms of comfort, durability, battery life, and other Switch-specific extras, but we’ll get to those a little later.

The Switch Pro controller can be used to play PC games. But like the DualSense, it’s not a plug-and-play affair unless you literally plug it in via USB. To use it wirelessly, running Steam can help you out, as it officially supports the Switch Pro controller. Adding non-Steam games to your Steam library is a clever way to ensure compatibility for games that support controllers. Again, you can do that by clicking the “Add a Game” option on the bottom left corner in the Steam client.

“This is a very solid, unassuming but beautifully engineered pad, with Nintendo’s typically great ergonomics and switchgear. The D-pad is one of the best out there, and those lovely, fat, responsive face buttons will give you SNES flashbacks in a good way” —Oli Welsh

Alternatively, if you don’t want to use Steam to play your games, relying on DS4Windows and its bevy of drivers is a free yet slightly advanced way to make Windows recognize your Switch Pro wireless controller. Of course, that $19.99 8BitDo USB Adapter 2 that I keep referencing can come in handy here, too. After plugging it into your PC and tethering wirelessly to it, you’re good to go — no fussing with apps required.

The Switch Pro controller is, unsurprisingly, a fantastic Switch controller. Like the Joy-Cons, it supports motion controls, HD rumble for more subtle, accurate jolts of haptic feedback in games, and amiibo connectivity to redeem in-game perks in several games, including the upcoming The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom.

This might seem small, but it stands out as being one of a few wireless Switch controllers in existence that can wake the console remotely by holding down its home button. Many require you to manually turn on the console, which can be a minor annoyance.

8BitDo Ultimate 2.4g controller

8BitDo has released a lot of controllers in recent years, but the name for its Ultimate controller is fitting. It has many of the features from its best gamepads, plus some extras that should settle any sticker shock associated with its $49.99 price.

For starters, its asymmetrical analog stick layout, overall shape, and face button labels should feel right at home for people who love the shape of the Xbox controller. All of the buttons, triggers, and sticks feel just as good to use as any modern controller from a console manufacturer.

Like several other 8BitDo controllers, this one can be thoroughly customized with its Ultimate software on mobile devices, or on PC. From there, you can remap controls, assign buttons to its two rear paddle buttons, tweak the actuation sensitivity of its triggers, and adjust stick settings. The controller allows up to three custom control schemes, which you can switch between with its middle “star” button.

The Ultimate controller ships with a charging dock, and nesting inside of that dock is a 2.4 GHz transmitter that makes it fast and easy to connect to a PC. The dock makes for a convenient way to charge the controller, and you can switch between DirectInput and XInput by using a switch on its back, depending on the requirements of each PC game.

8BitDo makes a pricier version of this controller with Nintendo-style face buttons called the Ultimate Bluetooth. They’re virtually identical, and it can work via 2.4 GHz with PC, too. However, its biggest benefit is its Gulikit Hall effect analog sticks, which are resistant to developing drift over time by design. By comparison, the potentiometer-based sticks used in the Ultimate 2.4g (and all of the other controllers mentioned so far) bear no such guarantee. There’s a possibility you may never experience the issue firsthand, but the anti-drifting sticks alone might be a reason for some to consider buying the Ultimate Bluetooth.

The Ultimate Bluetooth is similar in a lot of ways to Nintendo’s Switch Pro controller, with its motion control support, rechargeable battery, and Nintendo-style face button layout.

A bride-to-be has been defended after choosing her mother to walk her down the aisle instead of her stepfather.

In a recent post shared to the popular “Am I The A**hole?” Reddit forum, the mother – who goes by the username u/PopShort7064 – asked if she was in the wrong for agreeing to walk her child down the aisle, in addition to doing a mother/daughter dance at the wedding. She specified that she also has a husband, who’s been a stepfather to her daughter since she was 10.

The parent went on to give more context about her family, noting that she lost the father of her children - Calla and Hawthorn - when they were six and eight. She then shared that she remarried four years later, before opening up about her relationship with her second husband and how her children reacted to it.

“We were friends for several months, dated some, stronger feelings developed and I introduced him to the kids to see how they would get along,” she wrote. “We halted for a year while my kids and I did some therapy because their reaction to my husband was strongly negative, because they didn’t want to replace their dad. But once therapy was ongoing, they were doing better. From there, things move faster but the kids were on board for things to move on.”

The mother specified that it was clear to her children that her husband “was not going to be filling the role of a dad in their lives”. She added that her partner “was fine with that, as long as he was respected and they could work toward being a caring family”.

She continued to note that while she had a close relationship with Calla, it was “extremely tough” for her child to lose her father. She specified that while her child has a good relationship with her stepfather, “it comes nowhere close to the bond she had with her dad”. She also shared that she continued to get close to her daughter after she turned 12, before recalling a point in Calla’s childhood when she asked her mother to walk her down the aisle.

“She was 15 when she told me if she ever got married she would want me to walk her down the aisle and for us to do a mother/daughter dance instead of a father/daughter one,” the parent wrote. “I told her we could dance to the song her dad used to sing to her. She said she loved the idea.”

The Reddit user expressed that she “always assumed things would change” down the line, with her daughter either choosing to walk alone or with her brother, “as a representation of her dad”. However, she shared that when her daughter got engaged, she “asked [her mother] right away” to walk her down the aisle.

“She brought up our past conversation and told me she wanted exactly that. I told her I would be honoured,” she wrote. “We cried tears of joy together. I told her that her dad would be so proud.”

However, according to the Reddit user, her husband didn’t take the news as expected. She explained that he asked her a series of questions, with the first one being if she asked Calla if both her mother and stepfather could walk her down the aisle. The woman noted that she didn’t ask her daughter that.

“Then he asked if she ever considered asking him, and I said I could not answer that for her. He asked me if I thought of him when I said yes,” she continued. “He asked whether I gave any thought to all he has done for Calla, for both kids, and the fact he’s still not looked upon as a fatherly figure all these years later. I told him I did not think of him when asked because I was overjoyed. He told me I should have given him a lot more consideration and I should have tried to compromise with my daughter.”

She claimed that three weeks after the incident, her husband hasn’t changed his stance and he still feels like his wife “was wrong”. She also said that he told her he “felt he deserved more from all” of the family, and that his wife should be “making sure he is respected and honoured for his contribution to the kids’ lives”.

The Reddit post has quickly gone viral, as it has received more than 6,500 upvotes. In the comments, many people have gone on to defend the bride’s mother, noting that her husband should respect Calla’s decisions for her wedding day. They also criticised the stepfather and claimed he should be more considerate of Calla’s bond with her late father.

“I can tell you that no man, as you know, could ever hold a candle to my father so I feel comfortable saying that your daughter would probably never ask him [because] it would be like disrespecting the memory of her father,” one wrote. “And if your husband is close enough to your daughter, he could just ask her himself. It probably isn’t as personal for her as it is for him, especially if you and your husband did not have any more children.”

“This isn’t about him and all he’s done. It’s about Calla,” another added. “She lost her dad and, while the grief fades a bit over the years, big events bring it roaring back in (at least that’s been my experience). Her wedding is going to be bittersweet. She needs her parent (the one she’s always had and the one who loved her dad) to ‘give her away.’”

A third wrote: “The real question here is why does your husband believe he’s more entitled to this honour of walking your daughter down the aisle, and ‘giving’ her away than YOU? You, who is her mother, who has been there through it all, who has comforted and given her a home and place to be herself, unconditionally?”

Charlie Sheen is speaking out about his current experience with fatherhood.

The actor claims that he is currently raising his two youngest children, 14-year-old twins Max and Bob, on his own. As he explained to People, most of his time lately has been spent on ""doing single dad stuff.""

The boys' mother, Brooke Mueller, has struggled with drug addiction for several years. He said that recently she ""has been trying to figure some stuff out on her end, so she's not in the picture too much right now.""

CHARLIE SHEEN'S ‘SURREAL’ TV RETURN COMES AFTER HE COMPARED DRUG, ALCOHOL ADDICTION TO ‘DEMONIC POSESSION’

Mueller's rep declined to comment on the situation to Fox News Digital.

Sheen, who also has three daughters — one with a high school sweetheart and two with ex-wife Denise Richards — called his sons ""really cool, really smart and really funny,"" but admitted they do have a bit of a problem ""worshiping their devices.""

He laughed, ""Although on the flip side, when they're doing that it gives me a little time to not be dragging them all over the city. But I also feel like the screens detract them from having other opportunities to expand their minds in other areas.""

Sheen went through his own period of addiction several years ago — Richards famously took the twins in at one point when Sheen and Mueller were both deemed incapable of caring for them. But now, as he's preparing for a return to television and focusing so much on parenting, things seem to be looking up.

Fox News Digital takes a look at other celebrity fathers who have raised or are raising their children on their own.

John Travolta

John Travolta and Kelly Preston were married in 1991, and they had three children together: Jett, who died at 16 in 2009; Ella, 22; and Benjamin, 13. Preston passed away in 2020 after battling breast cancer.

In 2021, Travolta appeared on Kevin Hart's interview show ""Hart to Heart"" and shared an intimate conversation he had with Benjamin about the loss of his mother, recalling, ""(Ben) said to me once, 'Because mom passed away, I'm afraid you're going to.' I said, 'Well, it's a very different thing.' And I went through the differences about my longevity and her limited life.""

JOHN TRAVOLTA HONORS LATE WIFE KELLY PRESTON ON MOTHER'S DAY WITH SWEET THROWBACK VIDEO

He continued, ""I said, 'Ben, you have always loved the truth, and I'm going to tell you the truth about life. Nobody knows when they are going to go or when they are going to stay. Your brother left at 16. Too young. Your mother left at 57. That was too young. But who's to say? I could die tomorrow. You could. Anybody can. So let's look at it like it's part of life. You don't know exactly. You just do your best at trying to live the longest you can.""

Last year, Ella made a touching Father's Day post on social media for Travolta, calling him ""the smartest, kindest, most generous man I know.""

She added, ""Just by being yourself, you have taught me the most important lessons in life. Thank you for everything you do and for being my friend. I love you Daddy.""

Liam Neeson

Liam Neeson was married to actress Natasha Richardson from 1994 until her death after a skiing accident in 2009. They had two children together, sons Micheál and Daniel. They were 13 and 12, respectively, when their mother died.

In 2014, he told GQ that raising his sons on his own was ""just still a day-to-day thing,"" explaining, ""They’re flexing muscles and sometimes dangerous avenues, and you think, 'F---. If Tasha was here, someone could share this.' But yeah, we’re doing all right, you know?""

He said, ""The thing Tasha and I really wanted to instill in them was manners. That may sound like such a basic thing, but I’ve heard so many adults say, 'Oh, my God, your sons — they look you straight in the eye. They’re very polite and mannered.' It makes me proud. And it can get you through a lot, in a way. Just showing respect for your fellow man.""

LIAM NEESON'S ‘RETRIBUTION’ ACTION HERO ROLE LATEST IN STORIED CAREER MARKED BY LOVE AND LOSS

Neeson also admitted to ""drinking too much"" after losing his wife. In another 2014 interview, this one with ""60 Minutes,"" he said that grief sometimes hit him ""like a wave. You just get this profound feeling of instability."" He stopped drinking altogether in 2013.

Micheál and Daniel, now 28 and 27, are both actors. Micheál took on his mother's surname of Richardson, something Neeson said was ""the right thing"" to do.

""I think it was a lovely homage, a nice gesture and he's, you know, he's not saddled with my last name which, I have a certain celebrity status I guess,"" Neeson told Andy Cohen in 2020. ""I'd hate for him to be constantly asked, 'Oh, are you Liam Neeson's son?' So, it was a lovely gesture. Natasha's family, mother and sisters, were very touched by it, as indeed I was, too.""

Kevin Federline

Kevin Federline met Britney Spears in 2004 at a nightclub, and months later they were married. They welcomed two sons together, Preston and Jayden, before divorcing in 2007. At the time of the divorce, they split custody, but a few months later, Federline would receive sole physical custody because of what a judge called Spears' ""habitual, frequent and continuous use of controlled substances and alcohol.""

In 2008, when Spears began experiencing trouble with her mental health, Federline was awarded sole legal custody as well. Spears was given visitation rights. In her recently released memoir, ""The Woman in Me,"" she claimed that she agreed to her conservatorship for her kids.

""Because I played by the rules, I was reunited with my boys,"" Spears explained.

She eventually gained more custody, though Federline has remained the kids' primary caregiver. They have lived with him since the divorce. Earlier this year, they moved to Hawaii with Spears' approval.

After years of getting along, some tension began to show in 2022. Spears and Federline both shared negative posts on social media about the other, which they both deleted. Soon after, Preston and Jayden did a rare interview with ITV to discuss the situation.

While Jayden clarified that there was ""no hate"" involved towards anyone, he said that ""it will take a lot of time and effort"" to fix their relationship with their mother. He clarified, ""I 100% think this can be fixed. It's just going to take a lot of time and effort. I just want her to get better mentally. When she gets better, I really want to see her again.""

In a message directly to Spears, he said, ""I love you a lot, I hope for the best for you. Maybe one day we can sit down like this and talk again.""

They reportedly haven't seen each other since early last year.

Dean Cain

Dean Cain has one child, a son named Christopher, 23, with ex-girlfriend Samantha Torres. The couple broke up when their child was still a toddler, and after a bitter court battle that lasted for 18 months, they agreed to split custody in 2003.

In 2011, Cain was given sole custody, which he maintained until Christopher became an adult.

In 2014, the actor told People, ""Stability-wise this is what’s best for him."" Cain and Torrres agreed to the arrangement so that their son could be brought up in one home.

He admitted it can be ""difficult"" to juggle everything, but said, ""I’ve learned to make the decisions that put him first.""

Last year, Cain told Fox News Digital that the decision to raise his son on his own ""affected my career like I can't even explain. I turned down being one of, if not the highest-paid actor on television, for a show that ended up going six years.""

""The contract was very attractive,"" he said. ""But I was in the middle of a custody dispute, so I could either be a father or take that job. It took me a split second, not even a split second.""

Having a father in a child's home is something Cain called ""hugely important,"" and he added, ""I would never change what I've done in terms of being a father versus a career.""","Charlie Sheen is 'single dad' to twins, follows John Travolta, Liam Neeson raising kids solo",https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/charlie-sheen-single-dad-twins-follows-john-travolta-liam-neeson-raising-kids-solo,FOX News - Entertainment
entertainment,,2023-10-13T23:00:08+00:00,"Taylor Swift's biggest album 1989 returns with new tracks from the vault Published 27 October

Image source, Getty Images Image caption, Taylor Swift's 1989 tour sold 2.2m tickets and earned more than $250m at the box office

On Friday, Taylor Swift released a new version of 1989 - the biggest-selling album of her career, and the one that definitively turned her into a pop star.

Featuring hits like Shake It Off, Blank Space and Style, it was originally written during the 2013-14 Red Tour, with demos stored on her phone in a folder named ""Sailor Twips"".

Awarded a Grammy for album of the year, it has spent 325 weeks in the UK charts.

But now she has re-recorded it as the latest part of an ongoing campaign to regain control of her work, after an investment company bought her master tapes in 2019.

This is the biggest and riskiest part of the project. While earlier remakes were largely made with a live band, 1989's pop landscapes are full of squelchy, processed synths and treated vocals.

Fans can now find out how it has turned out - and hear five new tracks from the star's vault, expanding on the themes and relationships she explored on the original.

Here's a guide to all the songs and what Taylor has said about them.

1) Welcome To New York

""It's a new soundtrack, I could dance to this beat forever more.""

We open with a mission statement: The old Taylor can't come to the phone right now, she's dead.

After building her reputation in Nashville, 1989 jettisons the banjos in favour of insistent, needling beats and tales of bohemian nightlife. ""A farewell to twang,"" the New York Times called it.

Taylor knew change was necessary. ""I don't have the option of making music that sounds just like what I've done before,"" she told Popcrush. ""People will see right through it. They'll see that I was lazy"".

Her label begged her to add three country-leaning songs to the album, but she stood her ground.

""At a certain point, if you chase two rabbits, you lose them both.""

Welcome To New York itself is the sound of creative and personal freedom. Taylor moved to the city in 2014 and was amazed to discover she could go grocery shopping largely incognito.

""My friends and people who know me have commented that I'm physically different since being here,"" she told NYC radio station WKTU. ""That song is about the endless hopefulness and endless possibilities that New York seems to present,"" she added in an interview with Access Hollywood.

All proceeds from the track are donated to New York City's Public Schools.

2) Blank Space

Pretty much the perfect Taylor Swift song, Blank Space takes every horrible rumour that was being spread about her love life, and amplifies it with satirical relish.

""In the last couple of years the media have had a wonderful fixation on painting me as the psycho serial dater girl,"" she told the Grammy Museum. ""Every article was like, 'Here's Taylor Swift standing near some guy. WATCH OUT GUY!'

""My first reaction was to be like, 'That's a bummer. This isn't fun for me'. But my second reaction was, 'Hey, that's actually a really interesting character they're writing about: She jet-sets around the world collecting men - and she can get any of them, but she's so clingy that they leave and she cries in her marble bathtub surrounded by pearls'.

""I was like, 'I can use this'.""

Lyrically, it contains some of her best lines (""darling, I'm a nightmare dressed like a daydream"") and there's a delicious attention to detail - with a pen click signifying every new entry in her little black book.

Shout-out to all the lonely Starbucks lovers; and to Chicago indie band Hard Femme who took that misheard lyric and made it a real song. Those search engine clicks gotta be lucrative, right?

3) Style

An epic aural painting of windswept coastlines and propulsive wanderlust, Style is (supposedly) named for Harry Styles, with whom Taylor had a brief relationship in 2012.

Except she says it was inspired by fashion, and how certain items like a black dress or red lipstick will ""never go out of style"". That prompted her to write about the people who'll always be part of your life, even after the flame of romantic love wanes (all of which sounds like a classic piece of deflection to a probing journalist).

Whichever interpretation you prefer, the song marks a shift in Swift's psychology, as she briefly admits to having been unfaithful.

""I would never have said anything like that on a previous album,"" she told Ryan Seacrest.

""My previous albums have always been, 'I was right, you were wrong'. What happens when you grow up is you realise that the rules in a relationship are very blurred. It gets very complicated, very quickly.""

4) Out Of The Woods

One of 1989's strengths is how the music reflects the emotional tenor of the words. Here, that means frantic anxiety.

As Taylor and her partner run from forces that seek to destroy them, they're pursued by pounding drums and rushing synths. And there's a desperation to her voice, as though she's repeating ""everything's fine, everything's fine, everything's fine,"" against evidence to the contrary.

By the middle 8, it seems they've made a clean getaway. Then car brakes are slammed, and it's ""twenty stitches in a hospital room"".

In interviews, Taylor delighted in revealing this was based on a true story.

""It was almost like this very strange, subtle clue to the media that they don't know everything that happened in that relationship, and I can have something really major and traumatic happen to me and they don't know about it,"" she told NPR.

In her Rolling Stone cover story, Taylor said the crash actually occurred on a snowmobile ""with an ex who lost control and wrecked it so badly that she saw her life flash before her eyes"".

That prompted speculation the track was also about Styles: The couple had gone skiing with Justin Bieber and Selena Gomez in late 2012.

The lyrics also reference their identical aeroplane necklaces and a December break-up, which ties in with the ""Sad Taylor on a boat"" meme.

But the singer steadfastly refuses to name names: ""The fact that I've never confirmed who those songs are about makes me feel like there is still one card I'm holding,"" she told GQ.

Image source, Getty Images Image caption, 1989 was seen as a risk by Taylor's record label, but ended up becoming her biggest-selling album to date

5) All You Had To Do Was Stay

Traditionally, track five on a Taylor Swift album is the record's most raw and vulnerable moment - but All You Had To Do Was Stay is no Dear John or All Too Well.

Instead, it's a big disinterested ""nope"" to an ex who comes back begging for a second chance.

The song came to Taylor in a dream where her ex turned up at the door and, instead of giving him a piece of her mind, all that came out was a high-pitched plea to ""stay"".

When she woke, she recorded the sound into her phone and decided to base a song around it. Only this time, she got to say everything she wanted.

Image source, Universal Music Group Image caption, The video for Shake It Off was filmed under intense secrecy

6) Shake It Off

Rattling like a bag of spanners, Shake It Off is a 21st Century Hey Mickey, a honking great party record with a chorus that drills so far into your brain you start seeing lights.

It was the last song recorded for 1989, and Taylor arrived at the studio with a challenge for her co-writers Max Martin and Johan ""Shellback"" Schuster: ""We need drums that make even the person who's having a terrible night at the wedding [go], 'Oh, it's my song!'""

Like Blank Space, Shake It Off is a response to celebrity takedown culture. Taylor lists all of her supposed flaws (""She's an airhead!' 'She dates too many men!"") with a defiant ""so what?"", sounding much less bothered than the girl who'd written Mean as a riposte to a snarky music critic three years earlier.

Released as 1989's first single, Taylor spent three days shooting a video, codenamed Project Sparrow, that built on the lyrical conceit.

""When I'm at award shows, I have the best time dancing [but] I'm really tall and lanky so I look a little bit like a baby giraffe learning how to walk,"" she told a group of young Swifties.

""So all over the internet, it's like,'Taylor Swift looks awkward when she dances'. And as soon as I wrote [Shake It Off] I knew I wanted to do an entire music video of me awkwardly dancing.

""I'm like, 'Yeah, I do dance awkwardly, but I'm having more fun than you.'""

Image caption, Taylor was one of the main stage headliners at Radio 1's Big Weekend in 2015

7) I Wish You Would

One of Taylor's many 2am songs, I Wish You Would, is powered by a choppy, unrelenting guitar line that mimics her thoughts as they race uncontrollably in the middle of the night.

She's pining for an ex, absent-mindedly driving down their street and wishing she'd never hung up the phone or broken things off.

But in real life, the story was reversed. Taylor told Rolling Stone the song was ""about an ex who bought a house two blocks from hers""; while a hidden message in the CD booklet said: ""He drove past her street each night.""

The mystery deepens.

8) Bad Blood

Bad Blood has the dubious distinction of taking last place in Rolling Stone's ranking of all 237 Taylor Swift songs.

It's certainly not her finest work - a vendetta disguised as a pop song, with a ham-fisted chorus that lacks her usual melodic instincts.

Swift hinted in a Rolling Stone interview that the track was about a high-profile female musician, saying the person did something ""so horrible"" that made them ""straight-up enemies.""

Although she tried not to identify the target, it became common knowledge that Katy Perry was in the crosshairs, after allegedly ""stealing"" Taylor's backing dancers just before a tour.

Perry confirmed the situation on James Corden's Carpool Karaoke, adding that she ""tried to talk to [Swift] about it and she wouldn't speak to me.""

The pop divas eventually reconciled in the 2019 video for You Need To Calm Down... but Taylor's still performing Bad Blood on her Eras tour.

Image source, Universal Music Group Image caption, The Bad Blood video featured an all-star ""squad"" of Taylor's female friends, including Cara Delevigne, Gigi Hadid, Cindy Crawford and many more

9) Wildest Dreams

Growing up means letting go of youthful optimism, and Swift confronts that notion several times on 1989.

On one hand, she's developed an ability to laugh off her critics; on the other, she seems increasingly jaded about love.

Here, she's imagining the end of a relationship before it's truly begun. When it all goes wrong, she asks her partner, ""Say you'll remember me / Standing in a nice dress / Staring at the sunset.""

""The way I used to approach relationships was very idealistic,"" she told Rolling Stone. ""I used to go into them thinking, 'Maybe this is the one - we'll get married and have a family, this could be forever'.

""Whereas now I go in thinking, 'How long do we have on the clock before something comes along and puts a wrench in it, or your publicist calls and says this isn't a good idea?""

Interestingly, an early draft of the lyrics had the couple fleeing the city and blotting out the pressures of the world, an idea which eventually resurfaced in I Know Places.

10) How You Get The Girl

What's that? An acoustic guitar? Surely not...

This is one of the few 1989 tracks you can imagine working as a country song, if it was stripped of its whip-crack snare drums and buzzing basslines.

Over that backing, Taylor turns agony aunt, dispensing advice on how to win back someone's heart... although her solutions (standing outside their house in the rain, bombarding them with cute photos) suggest she hasn't quite weaned herself off Love, Actually just yet.

""It's kind of a tutorial. All the steps you'd have to do to edge your way back into her life, because she's probably pretty mad at you"" she told Radio.com.

""If you follow the directions in this song, chances are things will work out… Or you may get a restraining order.""

Image source, Universal Music Group Image caption, Deluxe editions of the album came with collectible Polaroids featuring Taylor's favourite lyrics

11) This Love

Taylor was beginning to experiment with different vocal styles on 1989, and the multi-tracked, semi-whispered performance on this track foreshadows the delicate sounds of the Folklore and Evermore albums.

The effect is almost aquatic, as though Taylor is drowning in the high tide she depicts in the opening verse. And that suits the song perfectly, with its theme of cutting someone adrift because they're not ready for a full relationship.

In an interview with the Scholastic book club, Taylor said the song originally started out as a poem in her journal.

""I just wrote it down, and closed the book and put it back on my nightstand, like, 'Oh, that was fun'.

""Then all of a sudden in my head, I started hearing this melody - and that's when I realised it was going to be a song.""

12) I Know Places

Continuing the theme of thwarted love, I Know Places was fuelled by Taylor's increasing anxiety over holding down relationships in the spotlight.

""I was like, 'No-one's gonna sign up for this. There are just too many cameras pointed at me, there are too many ridiculous elaborations on my life',"" she told the Grammy Museum.

""But I decided to write a love song [about] what would I say if I met someone really awesome and they were like, 'Hey, I'm worried about all this attention you get'.

""So I wrote this song about, 'Hey, I know all these places we could hide. We can outrun them'.""

13) Clean

Co-written with indie-pop auteur Imogen Heap, 1989's original album closer is very much the palette cleanser its title suggests.

For once, the cavernous 1980s drums are swapped for the plucked keys of a Zimbabwean mbira, while a weary Taylor emerges from the ruins of a relationship.

And the song prompts one of her best lyrics - establishing drought as a metaphor for emotional desolation (""the flowers that we'd grown together died of thirst"") before she's reborn in the cleansing waters of a rainstorm: ""When I was drowning, that's when I could finally breathe / And by morning, gone was any trace of you, I think I am finally clean.""

The song is all about the necessity of pain, she told Popcrush.

""For most people that I've known who've fought through struggle, a lot them who have really just faced the pain head on have come out OK a lot faster than the ones who just pretended to be in denial of it.""

Image source, Getty Images Image caption, The star gave an Alice In Wonderland-themed performance at the 2013 Grammy Awards

14) Wonderland

""It's all fun and games til someone loses their mind.""

After dressing as the Mad Hatter at the 2013 Grammy Awards, Taylor returned to Lewis Carroll's Alice In Wonderland for this EDM-tinged banger.

The song describes a fling with a ""green-eyed"" man (Styles again?) with whom she ""fell down a rabbit hole"" where ""nothing's as it seems"" until, in the end, ""we both went mad"".

""Any song [on 1989] that is touching on a relationship issue is looking back on it, and discussing what I learned, rather than you did this and now I feel this way,"" she told Radio 1. ""There aren't any accusations made. There aren't any outright diss tracks.""

Originally a deluxe edition bonus track, Wonderland doesn't add anything new or insightful to the mix.

Even Taylor agrees it's a minor entry in her songbook: To date, she's only played it seven times in concert.

15) You Are In Love

A gently-sung romance, this was inspired by Taylor observing her producer Jack Antonoff and his then-girlfriend, Lena Dunham.

""I remember thinking [the backing track] sounded so much like the sound of actual love, true love. Like, through thick and thin, sickness and health love,"" she told MTV.

Drawing directly on conversations she'd had with Lena, the song blends scenes of everyday life (burnt toast, borrowed shirts) with moments of incandescent tenderness (kisses on sidewalks and late night heart-to-hearts).

In an interview with Elle, Taylor talked wistfully about the couple's ease around each other.

""I've never had that,"" she said. ""[But] now I have more of a grasp on the fact that when you're in a state of infatuation and you think everything that person does is perfect, it then - if you're lucky - morphs into a real relationship when you see that that person is not in fact perfect, but you still want to see them every day.""

16) New Romantics

Proof that even Taylor gets it wrong: New Romantics, one of her most beloved songs, was originally held back as a bonus track.

It's a beast, though. An armour-plated anthem to resilience and power, where Taylor takes all the pain that's come her way and uses it to make herself bulletproof.

""Heartbreak is the national anthem, we sing it proudly,"" she declares, while glitterballs shatter around her. ""I could build a castle out of all the bricks they threw at me.""

That defiance also acts as a bridge to her next album, Reputation, which dismantled her critics, one-by-one. But that's for another article..

17-21) Tracks from the vault

In 2014, Taylor said she had recorded more than 100 songs for 1989 - so the relative scarcity of vault tracks is intriguing.

Whereas previous re-recordings have featured full discs of bonus material, this album gets just five new additions: Slut!, Say Don't Go, Now That We Don't Talk, Suburban Legends and Is It Over Now?

As a whole, they feel like dry runs for the songs that made the cut. The melodies aren't as crisp, the lyrics aren't as sharp. Suburban Legends has a particularly clunky line about letting a partner's indiscretions slide ""like a hose on a slippery plastic summer"".

Slut! has piqued fans' interest for its title alone - who might she be talking about? No-one, it turns out.

The song is thematically similar to Blank Space, commenting on the media's portrayal of Taylor's relationships: ""But if I'm all dressed up / They might as well be lookin' at us / And if they call me a slut / You know it might be worth it for once.""

The best of the new tracks is Is It Over Now. An angrier take on 1989's philosophical break-up songs, it calls back to the Harry Styles snowmobile incident (see also, Out Of The Woods) then, deliciously, references the ""Sad Taylor Boat"" meme - a photo of Taylor fleeing a vacation alone after the couple split up.

She goes on to call an ex a ""lying traitor"", accuses them of parading their new relationships in public, and noting that every new girlfriend looks like her.

""If she's got blue eyes, I will surmise that you'll probably date her.""

The fact that all the new songs were co-written and produced by Jack Antonoff suggests there may have been rights issues over the tracks she wrote with Max Martin - who has not been involved with the new re-recordings.

That means the vault tracks are all bathed in the dreamy, soft-focus atmospherics of Out Of The Woods, rather than the upfront pop of Shake It Off.

Speaking in 2015, Taylor admitted she'd been brutal about pruning songs from 1989's original tracklist.

""There were so many songs I wrote for this album that were really good, but if I felt in any way that they would have belonged on my last album, Red, they got cut,"" she told New York radio's The Todd Show in the Morning.

""There are really, really good songs on the cutting room floor because they weren't innovative enough or new enough. It's so weird to look back on that - you've got heaping piles of discarded songs that I really loved when I wrote them and I still love now.

""I just need each album to have its own sound and if it doesn't fit that sound, it doesn't matter if it's a great song to me.""",Taylor Swift's 1989: The stories behind her biggest album,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-66910595?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=KARANGA,BBC News - Entertainment & Arts

As Netflix’s acclaimed royal drama moves closer to the present day, the line between fact and fiction feels ever more blurred.

While Peter Morgan’s show has always presented a dramatised take on real-life events, many have argued that viewers struggle to tell the difference between the real royal family and the events on the show. When season five arrived last year, there were calls for the show to include a “fictional explainer” – something Netflix did not do.

With the show heading into the late Nineties and early Noughties in its final season, which arrived on Netflix on Thursday (16 November), events are being depicted on screen that many of the public will remember well.

The first part of season six takes place in the summer of 1997, and sees Prince Charles (Dominic West) building on his relationship with Camilla Parker Bowles (Olivia Williams), while Princess Diana (Elizabeth Debicki) sparks up a romance with film producer Dodi Fayed (Khalid Abdalla). The show also features the pair’s death in a car crash in Paris.

As the new season arrives, and fans wonder what in The Crown is based in reality, here’s everything you need to know.

Diana’s role with Tony Blair’s government

Episode one sees Diana visiting Tony (Bertie Carvel) and Cherie Blair (Lydia Leonard) with William after asking for a meeting with him. Recalling their discussion to the Queen, Blair says that Diana feels she “still has a lot to offer the country as a public servant”. He says that she had asked if there was a way to work with the government on “a more formal basis” and that any “official role” would be appreciated.

Following Diana’s death, Downing Street confirmed that Diana had visited Blair at Chequers with her son a few weeks before, where they discussed a special role for her as an overseas “ambassador” for Britain. Diana told a journalist at the time that the prime minister had recognised her skills and asked her to undertake “missions” abroad for Britain.

Queen Elizabeth’s reluctance to accept Camilla

As The Crown season six begins, Charles is frustrated at the public for demonising Camilla long after his split from Diana. Asks the Queen if she’d received the invitation to Camilla’s 50th birthday, to which she says she has, but cannot attend as she’s in Derbyshire. When Charles points out that plans “can always be changed”, she replies: “Why would we want to change it?” She doesn’t attend, but later tells Prince Philip that she doesn’t want for Camilla to be considered “wicked, because she’s not” or to be unkind to her.

It took a while for Queen Elizabeth and Camilla to grow close. According to historian Robert Lacey, she was reluctant to accept Charles’s request to be more accommodating to Camilla. Unlike in The Crown, she is said to have once referred to Camilla as “that wicked woman” to Charles’s face. However, she grew to become closer to Camilla. Despite announcing in 2005 that Camilla would become the Princess Consort rather than Queen Consort, it was announced that Camilla would be queen seven months before Elizabeth’s death.

Dodi Fayed’s engagement to an American model

When viewers first meet Dodi in The Crown, he’s in Paris with a woman with short, blonde hair. However, it’s not Diana, but an American woman who he says he’s picking out fabric for a Malibu home with and says he’s marrying in three weeks. His father Mohamed is unimpressed, calling him to Saint Tropez to meet a “special guest” and leave his “gold-digger” fiance – who he also calls “Madame Bikini” – behind. The model later confronts Dodi, asking if he was with Diana when he leaves her to go see his father. Diana also alludes to a “lawsuit” between Dodi and his ex.

Diana (Debicki) and Dodi (Abdalla) (PA)

This storyline comes to close to the truth as told by model Kelly Fisher, who claimed to have been engaged to Dodi when he met Diana. Fisher had previously modelled for brands such as Victoria’s Secret and magazines including Elle and Marie Claire. As in The Crown, Fisher – who met Fayed in July 1996 – was on another Fayed yacht when Dodi and Diana were first photographed. She staged a press conference where she announced that she was filing a breach-of-contract lawsuit against Dodi, after he allegedly asked her to stop modelling as much and prioritise the relationship. Through tears, she claimed that he had proposed to her (something his family denied) and promised to buy her a house in Malibu. However, she dropped the lawsuit following Dodi’s death.

Diana’s close relationship with paparazzi on France yacht trip

When Dodi and Diana first spend time together on his father’s yacht in France, the paparazzi are never far away. However, when William refuses to go outside until the photographers leave them alone, she takes a boat out to visit them. Wearing a swimming costume, she asks them: “We’re having a lovely time, apart from one little thing: you lot.” “Don’t be like that, you love us really,” they reply. Diana asks them to leave her alone as they’re “freaking out” her sons, before telling one photographer – who she knows by name – that if they go away, “you’re going to get a big surprise with the next thing I do”. She then poses for them in her swimsuit, but complains in a later episode that they can “never relax” with the press “constantly” around.

Former Vanity Fair editor Tina Brown, who wrote the controversial 2007 book Diana Chronicles, claimed that Diana would often tip off the press and “ couldn’t resist giving them the images they wanted”, including on the boat. Photographer Daniel Pirrie, who ended up selling the photo of the kiss, claimed that Diana herself invited him to photograph her on holiday with Dodi in France that summer. “She told me she’d be on the yacht somewhere in the Mediterranean,” he told The Daily Mail in 2013. “She let me know she was going to be on a tender going out to the yacht. I think overall, she was happy with all the pictures taken that summer… I knew that Diana had wanted [the kiss photo] to be taken.”

Mohamed al Fayed’s role in securing kiss photo

Throughout season six, Mohamed al Fayed (Salim Daw) is shown as heavily invested in his son Dodi’s relationship with Diana, even ringing up the maid to ask if they have been “intimate”. In Arabic, he then asks his secretary if they can find him an Arabic photographer – “not just any idiot with a long lens”, but “the best photographer on the Meditarranean”.

It’s not known whether Mohamed was so instrumental in securing the photo of Dodi and Diana kissing for the first time. However, following the Harrods owner’s death this year, biographer Tom Bower recalled in The Times how Al-Fayed “gleefully” showed him the photographs of Dodi and Diana and allegedly “revealed how he had rapidly bought a yacht suitable for his son’s seduction of her”.

Dodi’s proposal to Diana on the night they died

After bursting into tears going for dinner at the Ritz, move upstairs, he proposes to her with a ring she had previously pointed out when they sheltered from crowds in a Monte Carlo jewellery shop. She tells him to get up off his knee “I know the whole world is wondering if we’re going to get married, but that’s not a reason to actually do it.” However, they share a drink and bittersweet conversation about how they need to live their lives going forward - advice

In real life, Dodi did not propose to Diana on that fateful evening in Paris. However, at the inquest into the death in 2007, the jury were shown CCTV footage of him purchasing an engagement ring worth £11,600 in a jewellers across the square from the Ritz on the afternoon of the crash. It was later believed to have been delivered to their room before they went to Dodi’s flat, where a ring bearing the words “Dis-moi Oui” (“Tell me Yes”) – also the name of episode three – was later recovered, alongside a receipt for a “bague de fiançaille” (engagement ring). Speaking at the inquest, his father Mohamed claimed that the pair had met the jeweller in Monte Carlo during the holiday on the yacht, and that he believed Dodi planned to propose that night.

Prince William goes missing in Balmoral after Diana’s death

After learning of Diana’s death from his father at the royal residence of Balmoral in Scotland, William (Rufus Kampa) is left heartbroken with grief and angry at his family’s response to it. At one point, Charles is informed that the prince is not in his room and that “no one can find him”, prompting Charles and Prince Harry to look for him and a subsequent hunt across the grounds for the young royal. He is not located, but later walks back to the house on his own accord, drenched in rain. “14 hours, that poor boy was gone,” the Queen later says.

It’s true that William and Harry initially stayed in Balmoral with their grandmother following the death of Diana. While it’s not known whether he went missing, during a visit to Scotland in 2021, William recalled how that experience was one of the “saddest” moments of his life. “I was in Balmoral when I was told that my mother had died. Still in shock, I found sanctuary in the service at Crathie Kirk that very morning,” he recalled. “And in the dark days of grief that followed, I found comfort and solace in the Scottish outdoors. As a result, the connection I feel to Scotland will forever run deep.”

The first four episodes of The Crown season six are officially here, but many viewers believe one scene has depicted the most devastating moment throughout the entire series.

On 16 November, Netflix dropped the first four episodes of The Crown’s final season, followed by the last six episodes on 14 December. The latest installment takes place between the late 1990s to mid-2000s, and includes the lead-up to Princess Diana’s fatal Paris car crash in 1997.

The season begins with Princess Diana (played by Elizabeth Debicki) whisking her sons - Prince William (played by Rufus Kampa) and Prince Harry (played by Fflyn Edwards) - away on summer holiday to Saint-Tropez, France. After staying several days on Mohamed Al Fayed’s yacht, the boys return home to London where their father, the then-Prince of Wales, accompanies them to Balmoral Castle to vacation with the rest of the royal family in Scotland.

In episode three, Diana’s partner Dodi Fayed (played by Khalid Abdalla) surprises her with a quick trip to Paris, France. However, the princess is keen to return home to the United Kingdom, and is eager to speak to her sons over the phone. A mob of paparazzi following the couple delays Diana’s scheduled phone call with William and Harry, until she’s able to catch them again later that evening.

It is in this scene that The Crown depicts the doting mother’s final conversation with her sons.

William, then 15, and Harry, then 12, inquire over the phone when their mother will be coming back home from Paris. “I’m coming home tomorrow, and I’m seeing you both tomorrow night,” Diana replies in the episode, which also takes place on the same day as her fatal car crash later that evening. The boys then ask Diana whether she plans on marrying Dodi, considering their relationship has been plastered all over the tabloids.

Diana’s poignant last words to William and Harry shown in The Crown scene

“Well, you know better than to believe the papers,” she tells William, before adding: “I’m emphatically not going to marry Dodi. To be honest, I can’t wait to come home.”

When William sweetly asks his mother if she’s doing “okay”, Diana candidly tells her eldest son: “I’m okay. It’s just a bit mad here. I don’t really understand how I ended up here. Mummy just needs to make some changes to her life, that’s all. But that’s not your problem, that’s mine.”

Before saying their goodbyes, Diana reminds William and Harry that she will be seeing them the next day - although that day never comes. “I’ll see you both tomorrow night,” she says. “Just the three of us.”

The moment unsurprisingly tugged on the heartstrings of many viewers, who took to social media to share their thoughts on the devastating moment.

“The last phone call between Harry, William and Diana broke my heart,” one fan wrote on X, formerly known as Twitter.

“That precious phone call between Diana and her sons,” said someone else. “Don’t mind me, I’m just gonna cry in one corner.”

“The last call between Harry, William and Diana is heartbreaking,” a third user commented.

In both the series and in real-life, Diana and Dodi - along with their chauffeur, Henri Paul - were killed on 31 August 1997 when their Mercedes-Benz was pursued by paparazzi and crashed in the Pont de l’Alma tunnel in Paris. The mother of two was 36 years old.

The fatal car crash was recreated in the very first scene of season six. While the incident is not shown on-screen, a car carrying Diana and Dodi is seen speeding past a man walking his dog, before entering the tunnel. As the vehicle’s horn blares, he calls emergency services on his cell phone.

Australian actor Elizabeth Debicki, who took over the role of Diana from Emma Corrin in season five, admitted it was “difficult to recreate” the scene - especially with her character being hounded by the paparazzi. “It was heavy and very manic, and incredibly invasive. And it had a kind of pressure to it,” Debicki said in an interview with Netflix.

“At times it’s almost like an animalistic response to being pursued, by that many actors playing the press, because there’s nowhere you can go and you only have to be in a situation like that for about a minute, before you realise this is completely unbearable.”

How can there be ""Joy To the World"" when there is so much sorrow on Earth?

How can there be thoughts of sleigh bells jingling, chestnuts roasting on an open fire or Jack Frost nipping at our noses when war rages in Israel and Ukraine, and deep hatred of God's chosen people continues seething in our nation's streets?

Henry Wadsworth Longfellow, one of America's greatest poets, thought the same exactly 160 years ago.

AS THE JOY OF CHRISTMAS NEARS, FOUR FAITH LEADERS REVEAL ADVENT'S BLESSINGS: ‘WE LOOK FORWARD WITH HOPE'

On Christmas Day, 1863, the Civil War was a ravaging storm, ripping a gashing hole in the fabric of the Republic — while at the same time Longfellow suffered from personal tragedies.

Fanny, his wife of 18 years and the mother of his six children, had died in a fiery accident in their home after her dress caught fire from a lit candle. Longfellow's son Charlie was critically injured fighting for the Union army near Washington, D.C.

So on that day, the sound of the church bells heralding Christmas seemed to mock the very thought of ""peace on Earth.""

Yet through his personal grief and the torment of a war that would claim nearly a million lives, Longfellow penned his famous poem that has become a Christmas carol for the ages, ""I Heard the Bells on Christmas Day.""

MEET THE AMERICAN WHO RODE WASHINGTON ACROSS THE DELAWARE ON CHRISTMAS, SAILOR-SOLDIER JOHN GLOVER

Each stanza of Longfellow's poem ends with ""peace on Earth, good will to men.""

Modern readers living in a post-women's rights world shouldn't take offense at the ""good will to men.""

The poem takes the reader on a journey from how the bells herald the mirth in the traditions surrounding Christmas.

One, it's referring to mankind — humanity — not specifically the male gender. And two, it's based on the King James translation of the Bible, of Luke 2:14: ""Glory to God in the highest, and on earth, peace, good will toward men.""

The poem takes the reader on a journey from how the bells herald the mirth in the traditions surrounding Christmas: ""Their old, familiar carols play/And wild and sweet.""

MEET THE AMERICAN WHO PLANTED THE FIRST CHRISTMAS TREE FARM: NEW JERSEY ENTREPRENEUR W. V. MCGALLIARD

The words then repeat ""Of peace on earth, good-will to men!"" through the start of war and the blasts of bombs.

Then from each black, accursed mouth

The cannon thundered in the South,

And with the sound

The carols drowned

Of peace on earth, good-will to men!

It then questions God's existence and omnipotence.

And in despair I bowed my head;

""There is no peace on earth,"" I said;

""For hate is strong,

And mocks the song

Of peace on earth, good-will to men!""

Finally, through the din, it lets the bells speak of that one great truth.

Then pealed the bells more loud and deep:

""God is not dead, nor doth He sleep;

The Wrong shall fail,

The Right prevail,

With peace on earth, good-will to men.""

One of our great misfortunes today comes from not letting the carols of Christmas take their rightful place of importance.

Advertisers use them to sell products and so we miss their true meaning. A phone company's radio ad uses ""Joy to the World"" to hype a new phone plan.

AT CHRISTMAS, DON MCLEAN SINGS THE PRAISES OF ‘SILENT NIGHT,' OTHER HOLIDAY CLASSICS: ‘MY MOTHER’S FAVORITE'

Instead of ""The Lord is come, let heaven and earth rejoice"" — we now hear how much better one company's wireless plan is over another.

How can a hurting world know joy's powerful message of hope for a darkened world when marketing takes precedence over the words, ""He rules the world with truth and grace, No more let sin and sorrow grow ... He comes to make His blessings flow, far as the curse is found.""

The most popular Christmas carol used in marketing ads is ""Carol of the Bells.""

Few know its original rhythmic lyrics: ""Hark how the bells, sweet silver bells, all seem to say, throw cares away, Christmas is here, bringing good cheer, to young and old, meek and the bold.""

CHRISTMAS MUSIC IS 'ETERNAL, ALMOST LIKE PRAYERS': RAYMOND ARROYO'S NEW PROJECT HIGHLIGHTS CHERISHED FAVORITES

Each stanza is punctuated by the sounds of ""ding, dong, ding, dong.""

Although its lyrics make no deep theological statement about the birth of Jesus, according to GodTube, the biblical inspiration for ""Carol of the Bells"" has Old Testament roots.

""Hark how the bells, sweet silver bells, all seem to say, throw cares away, Christmas is here, bringing good cheer, to young and old, meek and the bold.""

Here is Zechariah 14:20: ""And on that day there shall be inscribed on the bells of the horses, ‘Holy to the Lord.’ And the pots in the house of the Lord shall be as the bowls before the altar.""

The verses in Exodus 28:33-35 talk about the bells ringing on Aaron's robe as he ministers in the holy place before the Lord.

And Psalm 150 says, ""Let everything that has breath, praise the Lord.""

Popular Christmas songs have their place, including wonderful tunes like ""Silver Bells,"" ""White Christmas"" and ""The Christmas Song (Chestnuts Roasting On An Open Fire).""

VIRAL POST EXPLAINS THE ‘REAL’ STORY BEHIND RUDOLPH THE RED-NOSED REINDEER

Even songs about Rudolph, and Frosty the snowman, and walking in a winter wonderland all warm our hearts during the holidays.

But it is only in carols that we truly understand Christmas — of the joy at the birth of Jesus, and also the somberness of what Jesus was born to do: to die.

A good example is ""What Child Is This,"" which brings joy and sorrow poignantly together as it sees the beauty and innocence of a tiny babe asleep on His mother's lap: ""What child is this who lays to rest on Mary's lap is sleeping.""

Yet it still sings of the future sorrow: ""Nails, spears, shall pierce Him through, the cross be born for me for you. Hail, hail the Word made flesh, the babe, the Son of Mary.""

That Jesus was born to die for our sins, to breach the chasm between God and humanity, is the joy and sorrow of this season.

MEANINGFUL WAYS TO NAVIGATE THE HOLIDAY SEASON IF YOU'RE NOT IN A FESTIVE SPIRIT

There is joy because He left His glory aside to live among us, abide with us, live the life we couldn't live.

And there is sorrow because our sin, the curse, was and is so great that God Himself took the wrath of his own judgment — and died the death we deserve.

Carols make sense of why there are still wars and suffering at Christmas. Carols express that the world isn't the way it should be, but they give us tremendous hope in what it could be.

The carol ""O come O come Emanuel"" is a mournful tune, almost funereal. Yet its refrain pleads, ""Rejoice, Rejoice!""

Why? Because ""Emanuel, shall come to thee, oh Israel.""

Emanuel means ""God with us."" That means because of Christmas, a new, category-busting power has come into the world, one not available for the tens of thousands of years of human existence before.

Grace and a love that surpasses all understanding is what became available because of Christmas.

The story of Longfellow's famous poem is now the subject of a feature-length film, ""I Heard the Bells,"" available on demand through most cable and streaming platforms.

To an age of AI and computer technology, a little story about a 19th century poet may seem anachronistic.

Longfellow's poem still bears the truth because it was based on divine reality.

But bestselling author and nationally syndicated columnist Cal Thomas notes that from his standpoint, things never really change.

Said Thomas, ""You can change hairstyles, clothes, styles, modes of transportation. You can even change politicians. But nothing really seems to change … A lot of that has to do with human nature.""

Longfellow's poem still bears the truth because it was based on divine reality.

Yes, hate is strong — but God's love is stronger.

Wars do bring death — but God through Jesus Christ has conquered death.

And because God is now ""with us,"" there is hope ... even with a broken heart.

entertainment,Daniel Dockery,2023-11-23T16:04:00+00:00,"Marvel built its comic book revolution on the back of one idea: rendering colorful superheroes as relatable. In the mid 20th century, DC do-gooders were essentially square-jawed Sunday school teachers, which let Marvel corner the market on heroes with human depth and fragility. The Fantastic Four were vulnerable to insecurity and in-fighting. The X-Men represented the cost of bigotry on a wide scale.

But Spider-Man represented this new wave best. Consumed by youthful everyman angst and desperate to find balance in his life, Spider-Man is broadly sympathetic. We identify with his struggles and his little glimmers of connection and triumph — which makes him the perfect superhero for Thanksgiving. And Spider-Man writers know it.

Thanksgiving has a complicated history, tied to the roots of American colonialism, and more recently processed through a lens of joyful capitalism. But feeding friends and family is perhaps one of the most humane acts we can pursue. It’s less about the spirit of giving, and more about admitting that people have innate, basic needs, like food and social comfort, and that those needs are best fulfilled when people work in tandem. Honestly, we should try to do it more on every other day of the year: The number of people volunteering to help feed the homeless and families in need peaks around November and December, but that energy needs to be carried through the preceding 10 months, too.

Spider-Man represents these needs, even though very few of us have to balance photojournalist work, a fraught dating life, and pummeling Dr. Octopus. Peter Parker is often the most financially strapped among his Avengers buddies, and frequently the loneliest, too. Those are recognizable traits among many young people, even those without radioactive-spider powers. When you’re growing up and trying to figure out the world, it’s easy to feel lost and isolated. But feelings of loneliness spike during the holidays, meaning that there’s a good chance you’ll feel even more like Peter Parker when late November rolls around.

It’s what makes the Thanksgiving scene in the 2002 Spider-Man film so engaging. That whole movie is an exercise in heart-on-your-sleeve sweetness. Everyone who’s seen it knows the Thanksgiving dinner rapidly descends into chaos, with Norman Osborn ominously sticking his fingers into Aunt May’s sweet-potato casserole, figuring out Spider-Man’s secret identity, and delivering a grossly sexist diatribe to his son Harry, leaving Harry and Mary Jane at odds with each other. Aunt May and Peter clearly wind up with a ton of leftovers after everyone else storms out.

But for Peter, who’s just lost his Uncle Ben and has been facing the initial trials of being Spider-Man, there’s a nice moment of personal respite at the opening of that scene, where he walks into a room where he knows he’s loved, bearing an offering of cranberry sauce,. Sure, everyone in that room is trying to hold things together. Mary Jane wants to impress Norman, Harry wants to impress Norman and Mary Jane, Peter loves Mary Jane but doesn’t dare hurt Harry, and Aunt May is finishing what’s presumably a dope turkey, in an attempt to care for all of them.

It’s the trying that counts: Life can be hard, weird, and cruel, but while sitting down for a meal with our nearest and dearest, maybe for at least a little while, we won’t need to have it all figured out.

Not all Spider-Man Thanksgiving dinners end up falling apart, and some succeed in reminding Peter that he isn’t alone. The first season of The Spectacular Spider-Man ends with a bang: One of Peter’s closest pals, Eddie Brock, has become Venom, and has threatened everyone Peter holds dear. This comes just after Peter himself was infected by the symbiote, and went through the now-iconic throes of pushing everyone away. Aunt May has just gotten out of the hospital, and even noted jerk “Flash” Thompson has given Peter hell for how awful he’s been acting.

Peter, attempting to make things right, opts to cook the Thanksgiving meal all by himself, but mostly succeeds in ruining the kitchen. No worries — Gwen Stacy and her father, along with a recuperating Aunt May and her doctor, all help out, and the episode concludes with a pleasant dinner. There are no big turns or twists, aside from Aunt May revealing that she’s publishing a cookbook. It’s just simple, earned solace in a life marked by chaos. Peter even gets a kiss from Gwen on his porch, a sequence conducted with a John Hughes sense of satisfying romantic flair.

Various Spider-Man comics have also dabbled in seeing what Thanksgiving looks like when you’re young and arachnid-themed, but real life has associated Spider-Man with the holiday, too. Spider-Man is the only Marvel character to rate a balloon in the Macy’s Thanksgiving Parade. Other Marvel characters have appeared on floats, but only Spider-Man has been inflated to 80 feet and pulled through the Upper West Side. (That also makes him the only Marvel character to have his head horrifically torn open by a tree branch.)

From his first comic book appearance, Spider-Man has been a reminder that life is hard and complicated, and being a superhero doesn’t preclude anyone from experiencing ordinary frustrations, setbacks, and confusion.

Americans started preparing their Thanksgiving menus weeks ago, with the requisite turkeys and stuffing ingredients likely already purchased for the holiday, which is celebrated this year on Thursday 23 November.

Apart from the food - arguably the main component of the day - the holiday is a beloved time of year when Americans come together to celebrate what they are thankful for, either with family or friends.

In America, Thanksgiving is a cultural holiday that symbolises peace, thankfulness, and the beginning of the holiday season.

What is Thanksgiving and where did it come from?

Thanksgiving is a national holiday in the United States celebrated every fourth Thursday in November.

The annual feast is in honour of the “first” Thanksgivings in America, in 1619 in Virginia, and in 1621, when colonists in Plymouth, Massachusetts, later known as the Pilgrims, allegedly shared a meal with the Wampanoag Indians, who were native to the land.

The later feast was in honour of the help the Pilgrims received from the Native Americans in cultivating crops and surviving their first harsh winter and it lasted three days.

Later, US Presidents including George Washington, John Adams and James Madison called for days of thanks throughout their presidencies.

However, it was not until 1863, during the Civil War, that President Abraham Lincoln declared a national Thanksgiving Day would be held each November to be celebrated by all of the country.

When is Thanksgiving?

Thanksgiving takes place each year on the fourth Thursday of November.

This year, Thanksgiving falls on 23 November.

Why do Americans celebrate it and what do they do?

Although Thanksgiving may originally have had religious significance, the day has become a mostly secular holiday.

Most Americans consider the holiday a day to gather and express their thanks through food, family, and football – with multiple NFL teams playing on the holiday.

During some Thanksgiving celebrations, people write down what they are thankful for and then read aloud from the pieces of paper.

The Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade takes place in New York City

The day is also celebrated with the annual Macy’s Thanksgiving Day Parade in New York City.

The world’s largest Thanksgiving parade includes giant balloons of cartoons that float above the city sky, as well as marching bands and dancers.

Following Thanksgiving, the month-long shopping for the winter holidays begins, with Black Friday kicking off the season.

Why is Thanksgiving controversial?

Although many Americans view Thanksgiving as a beloved holiday, it is viewed by many who have abandoned the holiday as a erroneous celebration of what was actually the conquest of Native Americans and Native American lands. The celebration has become controversial, as Thanksgiving has a contentious history that goes far beyond when the first feast was held.

In addition to a holiday steeped with cultural appropriation, the period of history in America is frequently white-washed, which leads some Americans to ignore the holiday, or, to instead observe a National day of Mourning.

Where is it celebrated?

Thanksgiving is one of the the most important cultural holidays in America, however, Canada also has its own Thanksgiving Day, on the second Monday in October, and Liberia celebrates Thanksgiving on the first Thursday of November.

What do people eat on Thanksgiving?

In America, turkeys are an integral part of Thanksgiving Day, with most dinners including the bird.

An estimated 46m turkeys are killed annually for the holiday, however, two turkeys are pardoned each year by the president.

But Americans who don’t eat meat or follow a vegan lifestyle don’t have to worry about missing out, as there are numerous vegan and vegetarian Thanksgiving options.

Americans also indulge in Thanksgiving favourites such as yams topped with marshmallows, stuffing, cranberry sauce, cornbread, and pumpkin pie.",Why do Americans celebrate Thanksgiving?,https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/history-of-thanksgiving-americans-b2445625.html,The Independent - Life and Style

Got it Normal text size Larger text size Very large text size This story is part of the Good Weekend October 7 edition. See all 15 stories . Melissa Lucashenko, the only person ever to have won both the Miles Franklin Literary Award and TV’s Millionaire Hot Seat, is struggling to concentrate. We’re sitting on the back terrace of the Avid Reader bookstore in Brisbane’s West End, drinking coffee in the late-winter warmth, which even in August is hinting at humidity. We’re shaded by a fig tree, which bursts with bird life. To me, it feels lush and subtropical. Peaceful even. But Lucashenko is distracted by a particular bird that’s dropping fig rubble all over us. “Sorry, that bloody bird is really annoying me, that’s a pest bird,” she says, breaking off our conversation. “Indian mynas, I hate ’em.” That the Indian myna is an import – introduced to Australia in the 1860s – seems apt. We’d been deep in discussion about colonial Brisbane, the hanging of the Aboriginal resistance fighter Dundalli, and the gestation of Lucashenko’s new novel, Edenglassie, published last week by University of Queensland Press. It’s a historical epic which depicts the fascinating period in Brisbane’s history when the former penal colony was morphing into a settler town, and Aboriginal people still outnumbered white colonists. In the book (named after Brisbane’s early moniker), the two groups coexist uneasily at the Queensland ­frontier, their interactions defined by mutual curiosity and suspicion, economic co-dependence and outbreaks of violence. “I’d wanted to write a novel of ­colonial Brisbane for a very long time, since I read Tom Petrie’s Reminiscences of Early Queensland,” Lucashenko says, having refocused after the myna interruption. “It is so full of stories and insights into the colonial era that as a novelist I just went, ‘Wow. This is begging to be fictionalised.’ ” Edenglassie had a long gestation. It was back in the 1990s that Lucashenko devoured Reminiscences, a 1904 classic that records the memories of the great Queensland pioneer Petrie, a Scottish-born explorer, gold prospector, logger and grazier who lived in the Moreton Bay penal colony, subsequently Brisbane, from 1831 to 1910. The book embedded itself in her consciousness and stayed there for the ensuing decades, as she moved to different homes over the east coast and overseas, as she wove through marriage and divorce, and navigated the challenges of having young children, and the challenges of having grown children, and the torture and exhilaration of writing through it all. Loading “I just had this vague awareness that I should be living in Brisbane to write this book,” she says now, firmly in Brisbane, which is verdant and infested with aforementioned noisy wildlife. “Because it’s very different to write a book when you’re walking the streets every day and looking at the river every week, than trying to do it at a distance.” She’s dressed casually in a T-shirt and trousers, finished off with borrowed thongs (her shoes were stolen from her house this morning). Her eyes are brown, expressive and kind, but she’s wary of too many personal questions.

Later, I look up Reminiscences, which I’ve never read. It was written by Thomas’ daughter Constance Petrie, who states of her father that “no one now living knows more from personal experience of the ways and habits of the Queensland aborigines. [His] experiences amongst these fast-dying-out people are unique, and the reminiscences of his early life in this colony should be recorded.” These fast-dying-out people: Lucashenko is one of them. The writing of Edenglassie might have been ­inspired by this fascinating historical text but its ­existence also represents a giant f--- you to it. When Melissa Lucashenko was awarded the Miles Franklin in 2019 for her novel Too Much Lip, the judges called it “a novel of celebratory defiance”. The novelist’s first reaction to news of her win was “Bugger me dead!“, which neatly sums her up as a writer: unpretentious, frank and on easy terms with vernacular. The 56-year-old is a thoroughly contemporary novelist who uses Aboriginal language liberally in her work, and who depicts modern Aboriginal life with urgency and humour. “That was really the impetus for this book, to say, ‘This is what was, and we’ve survived it,’ ” she tells me. Lucashenko receiving the Miles Franklin award in 2019. Credit: AAP In the historical part of the novel, set in the 1850s, Lucashenko tells the story of Mulanyin, a heroic young fisherman from saltwater country in the south, who works with Thomas Petrie as a young man. Mulanyin falls in love with Nita, who has lived with the Petries as a servant girl-cum-ward since she was a small girl. He dreams of buying a boat and taking his beloved home to Yugambeh country, but evading the colonial system to live a traditional life is becoming harder and more dangerous. The book uses the impending calamity of colonialism to tragic effect. The reader knows what’s going to happen but the characters don’t – some of them think the British might still go back home. In the other narrative thread, Lucashenko tells a story set in Brisbane in 2024, in which the centenarian grandmother Eddie trips on a tree root and goes to hospital. This event brings together her feisty granddaughter, Winona, and young doctor Johnny, who has just discovered his Aboriginal ancestry and is playing at being a blackfella, much to Winona’s contempt.

Lucashenko says there’s a “whole demographic of people who have an Aboriginal ancestor, who sometimes think they’re Aboriginal, but actually, regardless of skin colour, they’re white people and they have to go on a very long and different journey if they’re going to become Aboriginal”. Skin colour, she says, “is not ­irrelevant but it’s almost irrelevant”. Lucashenko’s grandmother, Eleanor. Credit: Courtesy of Melissa Lucashenko “It’s the lens you see the world through … I see a myna bird there, and to me that’s emblematic of a whole lot of things. It’s sitting in a native fig tree, you know, it should be full of fig birds. It should be full of magpies and butcher birds. It should, actually, be full of cat birds and bloody parrots but we are in the middle of West End, and there hasn’t been cat birds and parrots here for a hundred years … so it’s that kind of understanding.” Also, she adds: “F---ing up the simple ­binaries of black and white is a lot of what I’m about”. The book’s dual time-stamp structure is an attempt to render in words what Lucashenko has called the “double-vision” of Aboriginal people: the layering of the structures of modernity on the ancient landscape of their ancestors. “There’s a very strong economic and social and psychological drive in non-Aboriginal people to see us as, if not dead, then very diminished,” she says. “Until probably 10 years ago, I would have said the trope of the dying race was, ironically, immortal. But now there’s so much about us in the media all the time, and in the education system to an extent, most Australians have to recognise that Aboriginal people haven’t died out.” Loading (Census data shows the number of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people has in fact risen – from 548,368 in 2011, to 649,171 in 2016, then up 25 per cent to 812,728 in 2021. This increase is attributed in large part to people feeling more comfortable identifying as Indigenous, and also to the growing popularity of genealogical research.) That Aboriginal people were not all killed off in the early days of settlement was despite the best efforts of some colonists; one of the historical events that inspired the book was the public hanging of the Indigenous warrior Dundalli, the last person publicly executed in Queensland. Labelled on his death “one of the most guiltiest and most incorrigible of the aboriginal natives of this quarter” by The Brisbane Courier, Dundalli evaded capture for 14 years before being convicted in 1854 of two murders (the charges may have been trumped up). In 1855 he was hanged on gallows erected on Queen Street, but the execution was horribly botched. The executioner misjudged the length of the rope and had to swing on the hanged man’s body to finish off the killing.

Credit: State Library of Queensland “It’s really a historical fulcrum, the grotesque hanging of Dundalli in the middle of town in front of everyone: black, white, soldier, civilian, everyone,” Lucashenko says. “The way it was done, with the hangman having to use his own body weight to kill this resistance leader, to me that was a microcosm of the brutality and the spectacle of colonisation, and that was one thing that I really wanted better known. Just the inherent drama of it, as well as the historical importance.” As a novelist, Melissa Lucashenko is preoccupied with survival, and as a person, she knows a lot about it. Born to an Aboriginal mother, Cecile, and a Russian-speaking Ukrainian father – Vladimir Lucashenko, known as Wally Lucas, whose family fled the Russian Revolution via China – she and her six older brothers grew up on the outskirts of Logan, south of Brisbane, in circumstances where the chances of becoming an ­author, let alone a celebrated one, were remote. “My father was a meatworker and a cane cutter … Mum worked at a fish and chip shop and sold plants at the local markets,” Lucashenko says of her family background. “Mum left school in about grade three or four. She was a domestic from a very young age, as her mother and grandmother were. At one point as a young mother she was working three jobs. “Dad went to high school but I’m not sure how far he got. As a child, he was in an orphanage in Brisbane at one point with his brothers, after his father was violent, and his mother needed to escape.” Lucashenko did not know she was of Aboriginal ­descent until she was 15 years old, when someone she knew “picked it” and said to her, “You’re Aboriginal … go home and ask your parents.” About that time, a photo appeared on her mother’s dresser of “this very black woman”, Lucashenko says. “I said, ‘Who is that photo of that Aboriginal woman?’ ” she recounts. “My mother said, ‘Oh, that’s my grandmother. That’s why we’ve all got olive skin and dark hair.’” Lucashenko was shocked at the revelation, and felt “momentary ­disquiet” (something she attributes to internalised ­racism) but says it “instantly made sense”.

Credit: Courtesy of Melissa Lucashenko “For the 40 years since then, I’ve been learning the culture and I’ve had different teachers from different mobs and I’ve taught other people what I know.” She later learnt that her grandmother Eleanor ­had defeated an attempt by authorities to remove her as a child in about 1907 or 1908, in Wolvi in Queensland’s Gympie region, and that her great-grandmother Christina Copson had worked as a domestic servant from the age of eight: “She was a slave, she had no rights.” The family came under the extra scrutiny of authorities after Copson shot and injured a man who tried to rape her. She was arrested and jailed for a week. In court, she told the judge she’d acted in self-defence, and he found her not guilty. Her perpetrator was jailed for six months instead. The would-be rapist was an Aboriginal man. “No way she would have gotten away with shooting a white ­assailant,” Lucashenko says. “My mother … was determined that her daughter would have the chances she didn’t.” On leaving school in 1983 at the end of year 12, Lucashenko worked as a barmaid, a delivery truck driver and a support worker for women out of prison. She used to be obsessed with karate and has a black belt in it. In 1990, she graduated from Griffith University with an honours degree in public policy, having been the first in her immediate family to go to university. “My mother had no education and was determined that her daughter would have the chances she didn’t,” Lucashenko says. “There was no skipping school in my household. I was always in the library if I wasn’t on the back of a horse ... I was taken up to the headmaster’s office in grade one and made to read aloud and they all oohed and ahhed.” She published her first book, Steam Pigs, in 1997. It won the Dobbie Literary Award for women’s fiction and she was away, publishing three more books over the next 15 or so years. [In 2018 she told The Sydney Morning Herald that “Australia is a profoundly racist country and that is why I write more than anything else”]. She married – her husband Bill worked as a foreign aid specialist for AusAID – and had a son and a daughter. They moved around for her husband’s job, living in Canberra and on overseas postings, including in Tonga. Eventually the family settled on Lucashenko’s ancestral land, Bundjalung, in the northern coastal area of NSW, ­buying a property and raising horses. But that idyll ended in 2007, when Lucashenko and her husband divorced. She couldn’t afford to stay on the land and worried about becoming a “bag lady”. Around that time, her 16-year-old daughter was hospitalised with mental health difficulties and the two of them moved back to Logan City, poor again. As she said in an address at the 2013 Melbourne Writers’ Festival: “I knew what life was like in a suburb where the majority of people were ordinary, decent Australians, but a significant minority were prepared to sell their children’s Ritalin in order to fund a heroin habit. Like some kind of weirdly reverse Charles Ryder coming upon Brideshead, I’d been there before. I knew all about it.”

entertainment,Walter Marsh,2023-10-16T14:00:44+00:00,"When Vincent Namatjira was living in Perth as a teenage ward of the state, a school excursion brought him face-to-sail with a replica of the HMS Endeavour, the vessel that fatefully delivered James Cook to Dharawal country in 1770. After his teacher announced there would be a prize for whoever drew the ship, the young Vincent got sketching.

“Yeah, I won the prize,” Namatjira tells Guardian Australia with a grin, decades later. “That’s the first time.”

Many more prizes would follow. The now 40-year-old has won some of Australia’s most high-profile art gongs, from his Cook-inspired Ramsay art prize win in 2019 to his Archibald-winning portrait of the AFL footballer Adam Goodes in 2020, and has been awarded an Order of Australia medal to boot.

Namatjira’s colourfully idiosyncratic portraits both skewer and honour their subjects — sometimes at the same time, with what fellow artist and collaborator Tony Albert describes as “guerilla humour”. Often painting himself into the picture, in one scene Namatjira might be seen on a palace balcony gatecrashing a royal family photo op. The next he’s in an Acca Dacca T-shirt, patting a dingo and waving the Aboriginal flag alongside Cook and Queen Elizabeth II.

“I’ve become rocketing,” he says. “Before I ever picked up a paintbrush, I was just a normal Aboriginal fella. And here I am today, popping up everywhere – it’s completely changed my life.”

Back in the 1990s the teenage Vincent didn’t fully appreciate just how art, Cook and those colonial legacies would shape his life. Displaced from his Arrernte family, culture and country at a young age, he didn’t even know the significance of his last name.

“At that time, I didn’t know that I was related to this well-known artist,” he says. “And I never met the guy.”

The western Arrernte artist Albert Namatjira (1902-59) was one of the most well-known Aboriginal figures in 20th-century Australia, painting watercolour landscapes that blended western influences with a unique perspective on country. The elder Namatjira and the Hermannsburg school of artists became a cultural phenomenon but, despite fame and success, Albert faced legal and health troubles that illustrated a gap in this country.

That gap – between white and black Australia – has also influenced his great-grandson’s life. Born in Alice Springs in 1983, Vincent was moved to Perth with his sister and placed in foster care after their mother’s death. At 18 he returned to central Australia with little connection to his mother’s home beyond his surname.

“Getting off that flight, you see a lot of people coming,” he recalls of landing in Alice Springs. “A lot of old ladies, a lot of young people, everybody crying. They didn’t actually know me, I didn’t actually know them. It was from mentioning my [mother’s] name, Jillian Namatjira.”

Eventually Vincent settled in the community of Indulkana in the Anangu Pitjantjatjara Yankunytjatjara lands, started a family of his own and began to paint. The image of his great-grandfather has loomed large in the work he has created since 2012 – from the 13-panel series Albert’s Story in 2014 to a 2023 portrait that formed part of his Desert Songs series – but Vincent has never sought to imitate the recognisable style of his ancestor.

“We have both had to fill our legacies,” he says. “I want the audience to see my work and my name, Vincent Namatjira, with the work of modern art – more portraits, figurative. It’s colourful and bold.”

Namatjira’s 2018 series Legends features land rights campaigner Eddie Mabo, football player Nicky Winmar, songwriter Archie Roach and artist Gordon Bennett. Photograph: Vincent Namatjira/Iwantja Arts, This Is No Fantasy

Many of Vincent’s portraits pay affectionate tribute to his heroes, including his artist father-in-law, Kunmanara (Jimmy) Pompey, Archie Roach, Nicky Winmar and Eddie Koiki Mabo.

But he also takes aim at the rich, white and privileged – with status-puncturing irreverence. There’s his 2016 series Prime Ministers, which depicts the seven Australian leaders of Namatjira’s lifetime mugging for the viewer with grey eyes and white teeth. Or 2018’s Vincent & Donald (Happy Birthday), in which Namatjira and Trump share a birthday cake (both men were born on 14 June) alongside a bag of McDonald’s and a red hat that reads “Make APY Great Again”.

“See, humour,” Vincent says of the latter, pointing to the cake knife his painted self holds ambiguously between a planet Earth-themed chocolate cake and the then US president’s abdomen.

Vincent often describes his art as a weapon, and despite moments of levity there’s a keen edge of subversion informed by his years in the systems these powerful figures preside over.

“To be honest, I would like the government to apologise [for] taking these young Indigenous people into foster care,” he says. “In reality, we are losing much more of where we’re originally from, and our background, and our history. We have lost a lot of things, our culture, languages and our tradition.”

Indigenous people, we want to be heard and to take a stand Vincent Namatjira

Among prime ministers, royals and chief executives, painted portraits typically convey the power of their position – officially commissioned for palaces, parliaments or boardrooms, with artists granted rare access to their famous sitters. Vincent’s portraits, on the other hand, painted in his studio at Iwantja Arts in Indulkana, are gleefully unofficial and defiant.

“When I paint the queen on country or the king on country, it’s like taking away their power, putting us level with the rest of the world. And also, here in Australia, Indigenous people should be more powerful than the royal people.

“To me, I see myself as a royal,” he adds, recasting his great-grandfather’s 1954 meeting and handshake with Queen Elizabeth II as an equalising moment between two very different dynasties.

In June Namatjira turned 40, and will this month launch a monograph and major survey exhibition as part of Tarnanthi festival, the Art Gallery of South Australia’s annual celebration of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander art.

Collating this formative decade of his work, the exhibition’s title, Australia in Colour, alludes to “the blue skies, the red deserts, the green hills, the yellow fields, the blue oceans, the white sands, the creek beds” seen in the backdrop of Vincent’s portraits. But it’s also a more visceral reflection on a continent thrown into stark contrast.

“Australia in Colour is gut-wrenching painting, and hard work,” he says, in an interview that took place before Saturday’s failed referendum vote.

“And around here, this is the hard country, we work hard to be who we are today. Indigenous people, we want to be heard and to take a stand. To show our tradition and culture, and art – also to show the rest of the world that Indigenous people, we need to be heard.

A few decades after winning that classroom prize with his sketch of the Endeavour, Vincent’s success means that for many younger audiences, the name “Namatjira” brings to mind his name, not Albert’s.

“They tried to do what Albert Namatjira left them, that kind of technique with watercolour painting,” he says of his great-grandfather’s legacy. “To be honest, I’d like my family and my culture and tradition to change their ways, and go forth and broaden the name.

“To choose. He chose his own path. Well, I choose mine.”

Desert Songs is showing until 28 October at Yavuz Gallery in Surry Hills, Sydney.

entertainment,Nicole Clark,2023-12-24T15:00:00+00:00,"Many games are huge. Others are endless. Some are so exciting that they swallow our news feeds whole. That’s where Polygon’s What to Play comes in: We curate the best, most innovative, and most intriguing games on every platform, so you can spend less time searching, and more time playing.

eCongrats, you are the owner of a Nintendo Switch! It’s a wonderful position to be in, as the console has a robust, delightful library of games. Plus you not only get to play them on a television screen or monitor; you can also take the console with you wherever you need to go. And it doesn’t hurt that there are tons of cute Joy-Con colors, a great pro controller, and lots of themed peripherals for fans of all stripes.

The hardest part is where to even start, in terms of sorting through your options. Luckily, we’ve got six recommendations, ranging from modern Nintendo classics (that you can’t play on any non-Nintendo console) to indie games that are perfect for the Switch.

It was really and truly difficult to narrow it down to just six — there’s so much great stuff out there! — so if you’re looking for more recommendations, definitely check out the 22 best Nintendo Switch games, 36 best couch co-op games for Nintendo Switch, and the best Nintendo Switch games for grown-ups.

The best classic Nintendo Switch games to play first

Nintendo is home to some of the most iconic gaming franchises, and a great place to start for any first time Switch owner is with these modern-day Zelda, Mario, and Animal Crossing games. While it’s hard to pick just a handful from this wealth of options — not to mention other iconic Nintendo series — we’ve narrowed it down to some of the platform’s absolute best.

The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild

There are two standout Zelda games for the Switch that have gained the status of modern classic: Breath of the Wild and the sequel that came out this year, The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom. While both of them are masterful accomplishments — putting Link in an open world, and reimagining the scope of what is possible in exploration and puzzling — we’ve gone with Breath of the Wild as the starting point, because it’s where this iteration of Link’s story kicks off (and because it’s extremely accessible to newcomers). It has all of the joy of exploration on a vast map, as Link can climb and glide all over, without mechanics introduced in the sequel that can be overwhelming (as well as expansive).

Animal Crossing: New Horizons

Animal Crossing games have long been loved for their chill farming sim vibes and adorable villagers, but Animal Crossing: New Horizons perfected the genre. Great for newcomers to consoles and veterans of the genre alike, the game sticks you on an island where you get to design a cute house, harvest materials, catch bugs and fish, and court animal villagers. Time passes as it does in real life, so the game paces itself perfectly for daily engagement with tasks to accomplish — and fees to pay Tom Nook, the raccoon that lends you all of your supplies and lodging.

Even more fun, you can visit other friends’ islands. So if you’ve got friends who also have the game on Switch, they can give you a tour, and lend you a hand in the form of gifting bells or other items.

Super Mario Odyssey

In a sea of truly excellent Mario games, Super Mario Odyssey stands out as the choice for the Switch. This game was released specifically with this console in mind, and it perfectly mixes classic, whimsical Mario platforming with the expansiveness of a large world. You get to run around tons of different maps — this notably includes my favorite metropolitan area in any Switch game, New Donk City — some of which reference past installments of the franchise. There’s also lots of power-ups and critters to turn into, courtesy of partner character Cappy — you get to play as a T-Rex in a segment of the game — and hidden collectibles for the exploration inclined. Collect Power Moons and save the day. The world is your oyster.

Acclaimed indie games perfect for the Switch’s portability

With so many celebrated indie games, it can be hard to know which platform is the best to play them on. Here are three of our absolute favorites for the Switch.

Hades

In Hades, you play as Zagreus, prince of the underworld, fighting your way out of hell and onto the surface in this truly excellent roguelite. It’s got a fantastic, full cast of gods who give you various powers you can mix and match during the course of each run. But these deities are just one of many lovable, complicated, and extremely hot characters you meet along the way, as Zagreus’ story unfolds. Each run where you die doesn’t feel like a loss — the story is simply that propulsive. There are so many weapon and buff combinations to try, you’ll be eager to hop into your next playthrough, making the Switch’s portability crucial. Hades is for the Greek mythology nerds, but it’s also for everyone.

Stardew Valley

Solo developer and composer Eric Barone created both a game and a phenomenon with this one, which is inspired by the Harvest Moon series. In Stardew Valley you inherit a farm from your grandfather, and move in as you’re eager to leave the corporate life behind. Farm, mine, fish, and make friends with the locals in Pelican Town. It’s so easy to think to yourself “just one more day” and then lose hours, days, and months even to building out your farm, wooing a townsperson, and completing community bundles. The multiplayer is also excellent, as you can share a farm with up to three other players.

Hollow Knight

You’re a lonely knight, wandering through the crumbling halls of an enormous and wending kingdom — home to a defunct civilization of bugs — with only a nail as a weapon. But not to worry: your arsenal of attacks and powers grow the more you explore and defeat bosses. Hollow Knight is one of the best Metroidvanias (and Souls-likes) on the Switch, owing to its precise platforming mechanics, its memorable cast of characters, and a sprawling map full of secrets. There’s no better feeling than doing a little digging and then finding an entirely new region on the map. Hollow Knight captures that feeling — and you’ll want to take the game with you.",6 games to play first on your new Nintendo Switch,https://www.polygon.com/what-to-play/24007353/nintendo-switch-best-games-to-play-first,Polygon

Taylor Swift has revealed when her relationship with Travis Kelce really started.

The 33-year-old singer spoke candidly about the romance during a recent interview with Time after she was named the magazine’s 2023 Person of the Year. Speaking to the publication, she said she connected with Kelce in July, after he confessed on his podcast that he tried and failed to give her a friendship bracelet with his phone number on it during one of her Eras Tour shows.

“This all started when Travis very adorably put me on blast on his podcast, which I thought was metal as hell,” she explained. “We started hanging out right after that. So we actually had a significant amount of time that no one knew, which I’m grateful for, because we got to get to know each other.”

Swift also confirmed that when she famously first attended Kelce’s game at Arrowhead Stadium in September, she was already dating the NFL star.

“By the time I went to that first game, we were a couple. I think some people think that they saw our first date at that game? We would never be psychotic enough to hard launch a first date,” she said.

The “Blank Space” singer also acknowledged that although her love life continues to make headlines with every Kansas City Chiefs game she attends, she’s focused on being there for her partner. She specified that she isn’t trying to hide her relationship from the public eye.

“When you say a relationship is public, that means I’m going to see him do what he loves, we’re showing up for each other, other people are there and we don’t care,” she said. “The opposite of that is you have to go to an extreme amount of effort to make sure no one knows that you’re seeing someone. And we’re just proud of each other.”

During the interview with Time, the Grammy winner addressed how her appearances at Kelce’s games are heavily publicised. So far, she’s attended five of Kelce’s games, including one on 3 December, and she’s often seated in the Kelce family suite during the events.

“There’s a camera, like, a half-mile away, and you don’t know where it is, and you have no idea when the camera is putting you in the broadcast, so I don’t know if I’m being shown 17 times or once,” she said.

She explained that she doesn’t necessarily pay attention to the cameras and fans around her in those stadiums because she is watching her boyfriend play.

“I’m just there to support Travis,” she said. “I have no awareness of if I’m being shown too much and pissing off a few dads, Brads, and Chads.”

When discussing how many Swifties have now started watching NFL games since she started dating Kelce, she quipped about how much she likes the sport. “Football is awesome, it turns out,” she joked. “I’ve been missing out my whole life.”

Swift’s effect on the NFL didn’t go unnoticed in October, as one game between the Chiefs and New York Jets - which she attended with some of her famous friends - became the most-watched Sunday NFL show since the Super Bowl LVII in February 2023.

The “All Too Well” singer’s interview with Time marks her first time publicly speaking out about Kelce, who she’s been romantically linked to since this summer, when the football tight end first confessed to attempting to give her his number.

While Swift has attended a few of Kelce’s games since their relationship started, he’s also gone on to support her career. In November, he made his way to Buenos Aires, Argentina, to attend one of her Eras Tour shows. During the concert, Swift gave a shout-out to the Chiefs player when she changed her “Karma” lyrics to reflect their relationship. “Karma is the guy on the Chiefs, coming straight home to me,” she sang, letting out a laugh as fans in the audience screamed in response.

After the show, the “Style” singer was seen running into Kelce’s arms and kissing him, before he whisked her away backstage.

Elsewhere in the conversation with Time, the “Anti-Hero” singer said that she tries not to let the paparazzi get to her, even though so many of her outings with pals go on to make headlines. “Over the years, I’ve learned I don’t have the time or bandwidth to get pressed about things that don’t matter. Yes, if I go out to dinner, there’s going to be a whole chaotic situation outside the restaurant. But I still want to go to dinner with my friends,” she said.

She emphasised how her perspective about the media has changed over the years, adding: “Life is short. Have adventures. Me locking myself away in my house for a lot of years - I’ll never get that time back. I’m more trusting now than I was six years ago.”

With his love life in the public eye, Kelce has also opened up about his relationship with Swift. In an interview withWSJ Magazine, published on 20 November, he described how much he admires her skills as a musician. “I’ve never been a man of words. Being around her, seeing how smart Taylor is, has been f***ing mind-blowing. I’m learning every day,” he explained.

However, he also acknowledged the heavy public attention around his private life as a result of his relationship, noting he’s “never dated anyone with that kind of aura around them”. But, according to Kelce, he’s not letting the media affect his relationship.

“But at the same time, I’m not running away from any of it,” he said. “The scrutiny she gets, how much she has a magnifying glass on her, every single day, paparazzi outside her house, outside every restaurant she goes to, after every flight she gets off, and she’s just living, enjoying life. When she acts like that I better not be the one acting all strange.”",Taylor Swift reveals secret start to her relationship with Travis Kelce,https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/taylor-swift-travis-kelce-relationship-b2459441.html,The Independent - Life and Style
entertainment,,2023-10-28T11:00:24+00:00,"As Halloween looms up ahead, a cohort of Connecticut moms has been rehearsing their dreadful dance moves and creating creepy costumes in preparation for an annual neighborhood performance on October 31 — all to raise money for breast cancer research.

""It’s a bonding experience,"" Kate Garin, 39, an accountant in Fairfield, Connecticut, told Fox News Digital.

""Many in our group are survivors,"" she said, ""so to be able to connect with women and share stories and have someone to turn to if, God forbid, this happens to you, it’s very touching. It’s incredible how strong these women are and how amazing they are. And we’re having a lot of fun while raising money.""

The Mombies — a group of nurses, doctors, lawyers, accountants and more — meet in secret for several weeks before Halloween.

They select a theme and music, a mashup that always includes Michael Jackson’s ""Thriller."" They also work with professional choreographers and finetune their costumes.

""There's a lot of planning that goes into place and there's a lot of commitment and hard work, but it pays off,"" Garin said.

""We're all working moms and we all have kids and lacrosse tournaments and baseball tournaments. And so, you know, we try to weave it all in,"" she added.

Costume design and make up are a big part of the experience.

""We have a couple of Mombies who are very talented in the makeup world,"" Garin said.

""Before the show, we'll get together in groups and help each other,"" she added. ""Nobody does makeup on their own.""

They’ve also learned some solid hacks for looking more like the undead.

""We work together and we all have our own little tips and tricks on how to ‘dirty’ our costumes and

make them look raggedy,"" Garin said.

""Funny enough, coffee grinds is one thing that works well as dirt. So I've been having my husband empty all the coffee grinds into a bowl, and then I add a little bit of water, and then you just kind of rub it on the costume.""

But it’s all kept very hush-hush.

""Now it's almost like a mysterious thing,"" Garin said. ""People wonder, ‘Oh, are you a Mombie? Are you guys dancing?’ It's fun. Even my own kids don't know what songs we’re dancing to each year. I think the mystery of it gets people enticed.""

""Putting the fun in it was always the key."" — Tom Scalera

On Halloween night, the Fairfield Beach neighborhood comes alive as housewives, movie stars, socialites, prisoners, school girls, cheerleaders, soldiers and cooks — all turned to zombies — emerge from ordinary homes and put on a spectacular show.

""We dance four or five times that night or as many times as people show up,"" Garin said.

""They start sitting on the lawn of the people across the street. It started as this fun thing where all the kids are trick-or-treating — and then all of a sudden these moms are out there dancing.""

Garin is a mom of three kids, and one of them, Victoria, 12, is a competitive dancer.

""It makes me feel proud and happy that my mom is out there dancing and raising money for a cancer cure,"" young Victoria Garin told Fox News Digital.

""I think that when the moms come together, they create an amazing performance that’s super fun to watch,"" Victoria Garin added. ""After all of their hard work, I think they deserve a 10/10.""

The Mombies started out in 2016 when Terry Davis, a Fairfield mom and human resources executive, got together with a group of other moms to surprise the neighborhood with a flash mob on Halloween.

""She wanted to create a unique surprise for the kids to show them we're fun and to show them that we can be exciting, too,"" Gavin said.

""After the first year, she said, ‘Why don't we attach a little bit of goodness to it?’ And we started ‘Dance to Donate,’ which has created this big movement. We’ve been dancing to fund the Cancer Couch, which is an organization founded here in Fairfield.""

Dr. Rebecca Timlin-Scalera created the Cancer Couch Foundation; its mission is to accelerate research and treatment — and find a cure, specifically for metastatic breast cancer.

""The life expectancy of metastatic breast cancer [patients] is still just three to five years,"" her husband, Tom Scalera, told Fox News Digital.

BREAST CANCER SURVIVOR SAYS HER 120-POUND WEIGHT LOSS HELPED SAVE HER LIFE: 'STRONG, CONFIDENT AND HEALTHY'

Scalera said his wife was surprised to learn how few funds actually go into breast cancer research.

""I think most people we talk to are completely shocked because of all of the money that's raised by ‘pink awareness’ and other activities, which are great — not much of that money goes into research,"" Scalera added.

""When Rebecca found out, she immediately was motivated. She said, ‘I'm going to take all my skills and all my ability and create this foundation.'""

Timlin-Scalera died of metastatic breast cancer in 2019.

While her mission was personal, Scalera said his wife was focused on the future.

""Rebecca was hoping that she could accelerate treatments and that she would be a beneficiary of it,"" Scalera said. ""But she was always very, very focused on helping others and maybe helping our children.""

Timlin-Scalera was not a Mombie herself — but she loved the spirit of the effort, her husband said.

""It makes me feel proud and happy that my mom is out there dancing and raising money for a cancer cure."" — Victoria Garin

""We've been very connected to the Mombies since Rebecca's diagnosis,"" Scalera said of his wife.

""It's such a heavy topic and it’s hard to create an event that people want to be a part of and enjoy where, at the same time, they are helping to fight a deadly disease that impacts so many women. But putting the fun in it was always the key.""

Cancer Couch is volunteer-run and privately-funded — and 100% of the money raised is matched and goes directly to fund metastatic breast cancer research at two cutting-edge labs at the world’s leading cancer centers, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute and Memorial Sloan Kettering.

BREAST CANCER DRUG COULD HAVE POTENTIALLY SERIOUS SIDE EFFECT, NEW RESEARCH REVEALS

Scalera said Cancer Couch is a family endeavor.

His children, Bella Scalera and Luca Scalera, who now are first-year students in college and in high school, have been involved from the get-go.

""We, as a family, cover all the expenses of the foundation,"" Scalera said.

Since 2017, the Mombies have raised over $170,000 for Cancer Couch — and that gives Scalera hope for the cause his ""intelligent, highly motivated, Division 1 athlete, psychologist"" wife worked to establish.

""The thing about metastatic breast cancer is it seems to really take so many powerful and amazing young women,"" Scalera said.

""Rebecca was certainly a rock star,"" Scalera added. ""Everything was possible with her. There were no limitations on what she could accomplish in life. She was the perfect kind of person to convert her challenge with metastatic breast cancer into a foundation that is really focused on making a change for others.""

And the Mombies, Scalera said, are focused on fun.

""It's all that Rebecca ever wanted for this foundation,"" Scalera said. ""The Mombies are the perfect personification of that.""

If you’re looking to experience some of the winners from the 2023 Game Awards for yourself, you can find discounts on a variety of titles on Steam. Some other highlights you might want to check out include a sitewide sale on Blu-Rays from The Criterion Collection, and the Xbox Series X matching its Black Friday price on Walmart and Amazon.

As we do every weekend here at Polygon, we’ve rounded up a collection of our favorite deals from the worlds of gaming and entertainment, along with some of the best-selling products that have made a recent appearance on our site.

The best gaming deals this week

Steam is discounting many contenders from the 2023 Game Awards and winners from the past nine years. This is a fantastic opportunity to supplement your library with some of the biggest releases of 2023, like Diablo 4 and Starfield, but you can also find discounts on essential titles that you may have missed, like Valiant Hearts, Her Story, or Celeste. Below, we’ve highlighted some of the winners from the 2023 Game Awards, but we also featured a larger list of winners from previous years.

Cocoon is the latest title from a studio founded by Jeppe Carlsen, the person responsible for the unsettling narrative platformers Limbo and Inside. This psychedelic odyssey is a personal favorite amongst much of the Polygon staff and won Best Indie Game during the 2023 Game Awards.

The hyper-stylized, rhythm-based action game Hi-Fi Rush was nominated for a number of categories in the 2023 Game Awards and ultimately took home the prize for audio design, and with good reason. Hi-Fi Rush is a witty and wild game that features an excellent original soundtrack in addition to licensed songs from Nine Inch Nails, The Flaming Lips, and The Prodigy (just to name a few).

We’ve said it before, but once again, I’m kindly asking that nobody pay more than $350 for an Xbox Series X during the holidays. If you missed out on the chance to pick up the Diablo 4 Xbox Series X bundle for $349.99, Walmart and Amazon are currently offering the Xbox Series X as a standalone purchase for the same price, which is still a $150 discount off the standard price of the Microsoft console.

It’s a bit of a bummer that this Xbox Series X deal lacks a pre-packaged game, but there are still plenty of sales floating around to add some excellent titles to your Xbox library without paying full price. For instance, Amazon is offering some modest discounts on $50 Xbox Gift Cards, allowing you to pick up as many as you’d like for $45 each. Target has also discounted three-month Game Pass Ultimate subscriptions to $44.99 (was $49.99), which allows you access a rotating library of excellent titles for the Xbox Series X like Hi-Fi Rush, Cocoon, Venba, Starfield, and more.

The 8BitDo Arcade Stick for Xbox Series X is still available at Woot for $74.99, the best price yet for the $119.99 controller. This massive gamepad is a must for fighting game fans, so whether you’ve recently picked up Street Fighter 6 or Mortal Kombat 1, or you’re looking forward to the launch of Tekken 8 in February, now is the perfect time to pick up your new weapon of choice.

The best entertainment deals this week

If you’re a fan of The Legend of Vox Machina series on Prime Video, you can pick up a two-disc Limited Edition vinyl LP of the soundtrack for just $37.56 on Amazon, its lowest price to date. The soundtrack is packaged in a full-color gatefold sleeve and even contains exclusive tracks not featured in the series.

We recommend a lot of vinyl during our weekend posts, so it seems fitting that we should point you toward a solid record player. The Victrola Revolution Go record player is one of the more unique suggestions from our 2023 Holiday Gift Guide and is currently on sale for around $125 in a variety of striking colors. Normally $199.99, this portable record player is equipped with a convenient carrying strap, built-in speaker, and an on-board battery that can keep it running for up to 12 hours on a single charge.

The massive 6,187-piece Lego version of Din Djarin’s iconic ride from The Mandalorian is currently matching its Black Friday price on Amazon and is on sale for $419.99 (was $599.99). This is an ideal gift for any fan of the show, and is brimming with detail like a full-size cargo compartment complete with carbonite prisoner storage. In addition to minifigs of Mando and Grogu, you’ll also find a Lego version of Kuiil riding on his Blurrg (yes, that’s actually what its called).

Lavender oil. Eating kiwis. Masturbation. Everyone has their own “hacks” when it comes to falling asleep in 2023; the days of counting sheep are long gone. Jennifer Aniston’s top tip for battling insomnia is to “sleep with my phone at least five feet away from me”, while Martha Stewart recommends focusing on your breathing. In her 1973 feminist novel Fear of Flying, author Erica Jong notes that, sometimes, the only way to overcome sleeplessness is by pretending you don’t care about nodding off. “Then sleep became piqued, like a rejected lover, and crept up to try to seduce you.”

In a world where human sleep patterns have increasingly been plunged into chaos, people are having to turn to ever more creative – and often bizarre – means of getting their 40 winks in. Today, the internet is littered with tips and tricks that promise a sound sleep, but not all of them are effective and none are foolproof. (Kiwis, by the way, contain serotonin and antioxidants, which is why it’s thought they might have sleep-promoting benefits.) The result is a society with a growing problem on its hands: persistent sleeplessness – otherwise known as insomnia.

Globally, it is estimated that around 10 per cent of adults meet the criteria for insomnia; the sleep disorder is characterised either by difficulty falling asleep or staying asleep to such an extent that it disturbs your ability to function during the day.

Insomnia lies at the heart of the new Apple TV+ comedy series Still Up. The show follows Lisa (Antonia Thomas) and Danny (Craig Roberts), two best friends who stay up late talking to each other because they can’t sleep. Lit by the blue glow emanating from their electronic devices, Lisa and Danny form a deep connection over their nocturnal calls, with their friendship gradually drifting into something more. At one point, Lisa checks herself into a sleep clinic in London, telling Danny she’s willing to “try anything” at this point – a sentiment the sleepless know all too well.

The series was inspired by creator Natalie Walter’s own experience with insomnia, and her late-night Facebook chats with Steve Burge, her co-writer on Still Up. “As part of the research for [the show] we visited a sleep clinic, which was fascinating,” she tells me. “Some evolutionary biologists think the reason humans have different sleep patterns is that during our early history, a few members of the tribe would always be awake and vigilant during the night, and so could protect everyone else from predators. Not that I’d be much use fighting off a woolly mammoth.”

Just like depression or anxiety, insomnia can often be triggered by something. Whether it’s a life event as monumental as becoming a new parent, or something as commonplace as jet lag, there are any number of things that can prompt a bout of sleeplessness. The issue, explains sleep therapist Dr Lindsay Browning, is that insomnia can often remain long after the trigger has gone. “At this point, you’re no longer worried about the traumatic incident; you’re now worried about not being able to sleep.” It’s a self-fulfilling prophecy.

Social media consultant and mother of two, Amy Fieldhouse-Downes, started suffering from insomnia after the birth of her second son in 2019. She believes the affliction was rooted in anxiety. “If you Google how to go to sleep, I’ve probably tried everything on there,” she says. “Going to bed earlier, going to bed later, meditations that would get cut off by an advert, lavender products, sleep cream, eye masks, Sominex sleep tablets. And I even used it as an excuse to have a few glasses of wine.” It wasn’t until she tried sleeping with specialised earplugs that she was finally able to get some rest.

Long-time insomniac and video producer Preshita says she has tried many tricks over the years – “from drinking chamomile tea to counting backwards from 1,000”. After much experimenting, she has found that taking a shower before bed and keeping her bedroom clutter-free were the most effective methods. “Someone recommended masturbating, and that was another thing that worked,” she adds.

Millions of people struggle with insomnia in the UK alone. Studies have found that women are 40 per cent more likely to be affected by insomnia than men. “This sex difference in insomnia emerges after puberty, suggesting that hormonal differences such as menstruation, pregnancy and menopause may be the cause of this increased risk in women,” Dr Browning says. The symptoms of insomnia can last a long time; a longitudinal study conducted in the UK found that 69 per cent of respondents affected by the sleep disorder at the start of the study still had insomnia 12 months later.

This may go to show how complex treating insomnia can be. Explaining the appeal of quick fixes, Dr Browning says, “In the short term you’re changing something, so [they] can often [work] like a placebo. If hunger is keeping you awake, eating before bed will help. If your mattress is uncomfortable, sleeping on the floor will help.” But the problem isn’t just that these methods don’t necessarily work – it’s that they could be used to exploit vulnerable insomniacs.

“I’m a sleep therapist, my doctorate is in insomnia and it’s very, very frustrating,” she says. “People who have insomnia are desperate. I treat patients who are suicidal, who have quit their jobs, whose lives are completely on hold because of their sleeping issues. And they’re vulnerable. My clients have spent hundreds and hundreds of pounds on things that made no difference. If people are being mis-sold expensive things and they’re being preyed upon, that’s a huge problem.”

Rosie Davies-Smith, a PR consultant, says she has spent more than £600 on a variety of treatments, including a combination of doctor-prescribed and over-the-counter medications, teas, supplements, weighted blankets, and eye masks. “While supplements, exercise, and sleep hygiene provided some relief, the true breakthrough came from addressing the root causes of my insomnia through therapy,” she tells me.

As with many other mental health disorders, therapy can often provide long-term relief from insomnia. The most effective of these therapies is Cognitive Behavioural Therapy for Insomnia (CBTI),” says Dr Browning, describing it as a “complete cure” that a lot of people don’t know about. “Different from CBT for depression or CBT for anxiety, CBTI works by addressing the negative thoughts and worries that perpetuate insomnia.”

Other avenues of treatment are also proving increasingly fruitful. A new drug called Quviviq was just approved by the NHS last week. Dr Browning is optimistic about the “exciting” new medication, explaining that it acts in a very different way to other sleeping pills, which “knock you out” but cause people to develop a tolerance. “As much as CBTI is the gold standard across the world, there might be some people who need a bit of [medicinal] help as well, a bit like depression.”

In the meantime, Dr Browning says there’s no harm in trying the occasional Reddit recommendation – if it’s free. That might be an act of self-pleasure, narrating the plot of Pride and Prejudice in your head, or listening to shipping forecasts. FaceTiming your best friend into the early hours of the morning – like Lisa and Danny do in Still Up – probably isn’t encouraged, but it does make for a very good romcom.

On Thursday 23 November, Americans will be hard at work to prepare their Thanksgiving dinner, with foods on the menus ranging from a roasted turkey to a green bean casserole.

Aside from the dishes served in the lavish feast, which can vary based on families’ cultures and traditions, Thanksgiving is also the annual holiday for people to commemorate all that they’re grateful for.

In the midst of planning the big meal, there’s also a huge range of ingredients that need to be purchased at your local grocery store. However, since Thanksgiving Day is a federal holiday in the US, some stores will be completely shut down on the holiday.

For example, both Target and Walmart announced permanent closures on the holiday in 2020, with the policy remaining in place ever since. The outbreak of the pandemic had initially pushed these chains to close their doors on Thanksgiving, in order to limit crowding and spread out the shopping season.

However, that doesn’t mean that all grocery stores will remain closed on Thanksgiving Day. In fact, there are some retailers that you could make your way to on the morning of the holiday, in preparation for your annual feast.

Once Thanksgiving Day comes to a close, many stores will be reopening on Friday. From there, shops be operating during their earlier or usual business hours, in preparation for some of the biggest sales of the year.

Here are when stores open and close on Thanksgiving Day and Black Friday in the US.

Whole Foods

If you’re looking for some fresh produce to cook up a storm, then you’re in luck, as Whole Foods is set to be open during the holiday season. However, they will run on a limited schedule, and hours of operation may vary, so be sure to check your local store. Whole Foods stores will be open on Black Friday, with hours of operation depending on location.

Costco

All Costco stores in the US will be closed on Thanksgiving Day, as noted by the retailer’s official site. Costco Warehouses will reopen on Friday, with hours depending on store locations.

As Thanksgiving fast approaches, Americans are in the midst of writing their menus and buying the ingredients for their lavish feasts. And although it’s a day filled with food and family, there is another popular tradition that’s held around the holiday: Friendsgiving.

Every year, Thanksgiving is celebrated on the fourth Thursday of the month, with the holiday falling on 23 November this year. While it’s often viewed as a day for Americans to express what they’re grateful for, that doesn’t mean that everyone will celebrate. More specifically, the event has been viewed as deeply controversial over the years, due to the contentious history of the first Thanksgiving celebration in the 17th century.

The holiday has been linked to instances of cultural appropriation, with some Americans believing that its history is frequently white-washed, prompting them to condemn or ignore Thanksgiving as a whole.

However, the holiday itself has inspired another tradition of Friendsgiving – which can be held before, during, or even after the 23rd of November this year. The activity typically consists of a celebration with close pals since some Americans don’t have the opportunity to return home for the holidays.

Over the years, people have celebrated Friendsgiving in a similar vein as Thanksgiving, with everyone sitting around the table for one big feast. It’s also often done in a potluck style, with each guest bringing their own dish to contribute. However, you don’t need to have a big meal to celebrate your Friendsgiving, as there are many ways to change up your usual plans this year.

Here’s a list of activities that you could do for Friendsgiving that aren’t the typical sit-down dinner.

Shopping at local holiday markets

While Christmas is still over a month away, many cities in the US already have their holiday-themed markets up and running. And since Friendsgiving isn’t necessarily held on the Thanksgiving holiday, why not use it as an opportunity to check out some new shops?

For example, in New York City, Bank of America is currently hosting its annual Winter Village at Bryant Park in Manhattan. At the beloved New York City spot, there’s a wide variety of food vendors, so you and your friends can take your pick at what you want for dinner and dessert. In addition, vendors are also selling a range of goodies – from ornaments to jewellery to scarves – which is the perfect chance to do some early holiday shopping.

Hosting a movie marathon

Instead of hosting a big dinner, you could opt for another budget-friendly activity at your home: hosting a movie marathon. With the help of your friends, you can make a list of any horror, romance, or comedy movies that you want to watch for the day. You could also top off the activity off by supplying an assortment of snacks for your pals, or by cooking a meal all together.

Your movie options can also match the theme of Thanksgiving, with films like A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood (2019), Toy Story (1995), Addams Family Values (1993) and A Charlie Brown Thanksgiving (1973). If you want, you could add some Christmas movies to the mix, including Elf (2003), It’s A Wonderful Life (1947) and Steel Magnolias (1989).

Going hiking

Depending on the weather outside, your plans for Friendsgiving could consist of going on a hike. Whether it’s at your local park or a trail that’s an hour or so away from you, hiking is the perfect daytime activity for you and your friend group – no matter how big or small.

Decorating or baking sweets

Decorating or baking some sweet treats is another easy indoor activity. Whether you make a pie from scratch or simply frost your ready-bake sugar cookies, it’s something interactive for you and your pals to do together.

You can also opt for treats that are on theme with the fall and winter seasons, from baking an apple crisp to decorating gingerbread cookies.

Running a Turkey trot

Whether it’s before, during, or after Thanksgiving Day, many cities in America host an annual Turkey Trot run. The length of the race can vary, with options ranging from a 5K to a half marathon, so you and your pals can take your pick at what you’d prefer.

For example, in New York City this year, one Turkey Trot is being held at the Flushing Meadows-Corona Park. During the race, which takes place on 25 November, participants will be running for the Rolling Thunder organsiation, which is a non-profit “for mainstream athletes who are developmentally disabled or have other special needs”.

At-home wine tasting

Typically, a night out at the bars with your friends can get a bit expensive, depending on which spots you go to. In a similar vein, a trip to a winery can rack up a hefty bill, and it’s not the most enjoyable activity when it’s cold outside. With that in mind, your Friendsgiving plans could consist of hhosting your own at-home wine tasting.

For the occasion, everyone can bring a different type of wine – from red to white – and give a few sips from each bottle a shot. If you’re someone who’s a big fan of wine, you could even end up discovering a brand that becomes your new favourite drink. When hosting the activity, you could make your own charcuterie board – filled with different meats and cheeses – to pair with wine.

Playing a football game

If your friends have a fun, competitive side, you can take part in another outdoor activity. You and your friend group can host the event in any big outdoor space you’d like, whether it’s a local park or your pal’s backyard.

In addition, football meets the typical theme of Thanksgiving, as a beloved tradition on the actual holiday is to watch a sports game with the family.

Hosting an early holiday gift exchange

Who’s to say that you can’t give your gifts to your friends a bit early this season? While the winter holidays are still weeks away, you could use your Friendsgiving to host your annual gift exchanges.

For example, many friend groups in the US have opted for the budget-friendly activity of Secret Santa, where each person is randomly assigned someone to give a gift to. During the exchange, you then reveal to your pal that you’re their “secret Santa,” before giving them their present.","From a Turkey trot to a movie marathon, Friendsgiving celebrations that aren’t a sit-down dinner",https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/friendsgiving-thanksgiving-activity-ideas-b2445536.html,The Independent - Life and Style
entertainment,,2023-10-08T08:30:36+00:00,"This winter, head north and bring your warm hat and mittens with you as you watch the stunning Northern Lights, or Aurora Borealis, vividly light up the sky.

The display is expected to be even stronger and brighter than it has been in the past because of the sun's recent activity.

""Recent observations of sunspots, a measure of how active the sun is, show a dramatic increase from this time last year, and we are approaching the expected peak of the 11-year solar cycle in 2024 or 2025,"" New Scientist reported.

NORTHERN LIGHTS DAZZLE IN OVER HALF-DOZEN STATES: NEW YORK, MINNESOTA, ARKANSAS

""This means that over the next few months in the Northern Hemisphere, the Northern Lights will probably be stronger than they have been for at least a decade.""

With that in mind, now may be the time to pack your bags and get a close look at the dancing waves of light — but where should you go to capture the magic?

Northern Lights in America

If you don't want to break out your passport this season to take in the views, here are a few options located right here in the U.S. that will not disappoint.

Check out these ideas.

Fairbanks, Alaska

Fairbanks, Alaska, is not only one of the best places in the country to view the vivid light display — it's one of the best locations in the world.

""Because of its location within the auroral oval and dark skies, Alaska is one of the best places in the world to see the Northern Lights, and lucky for American travelers, you don't even need a passport to get there,"" Travel and Leisure shared.

The aurora oval is a ""a ring-shaped region hovering over the far north where Northern Lights activity is concentrated,"" according to travelalaska.com.

The view of the lights can be seen from just about anywhere in Fairbanks which means you can enjoy a magical display as you drive late into night.

Lake Superior, Michigan

Michigan is a great place to view the Northern Lights when in the U.S., specifically near Lake Superior and the Upper Peninsula.

The state has two important factors that make it such a great location for taking in the sights: latitude and low light pollution.

""The Upper Peninsula is blessed with hundreds of miles of shoreline along the south shore of Lake Superior, which provides some of the best Northern Lights viewing in the lower 48 due to the very dark night skies,"" Pure Michigan shared online.

""When looking north over Lake Superior, one can see right down to the horizon and take in a 180-degree unobstructed view of the night sky.""

Priest Lake, Idaho

In far-northern Idaho, you can find Priest Lake, which has become a major spot for aurora hunters.

""Priest Lake, in far-northern Idaho, has been my most reliable and rewarding location for viewing the northern lights,"" Visit Idaho stated.

If you don't mind planning a holiday getaway this winter, take a quick trip across the pond to see the Aurora Borealis from these unbelievable sights.

Tromsø, Norway

When picturing the landscape surrounding the Northern Lights, you probably imagine something exactly like Tromsø, Norway, which is why it is widely considered one of the top places to see the Aurora Borealis.

Tromsø is the third largest city north of the Arctic Circle. It ""lies just within the Northern Lights Oval, the region above Earth's geomagnetic North Pole, where aurora displays are most likely to occur,"" according to Space.com.

The stunning display can be seen from September to April.

You will not miss out on taking in the beauty of the sky when in Tromsø, thanks to the many travel sites and guides that offer aurora chases.

Swedish Laplands

Sweden has become a top place to view the dancing lights in the Northern Hemisphere; the Lapland region, in particular, is the most popular.

""Not only is Abisko, Swedish Lapland, within the aurora oval but the surrounding mountains also keep the skies clear and there's barely any light pollution,"" Swedish Lapland shared online.

In Abisko, you can find the Aurora Sky Station. It has an observation tower and experts available to answer any questions about the display, the Space Tourism Guide shared.

Jökulsárlón, Iceland

One of the most unique places to see the magnificent Northern Lights display is found at the Jökulsárlón Glacier Lagoon in Iceland.

""Jokulsarlon’s secluded location ensures minimal light pollution, providing the perfect setting to witness the stunning colors of the Aurora Borealis,"" said Arctic Adventures.

""The best time to observe the Northern Lights at Jokulsarlon is during the late evening and early night hours when the darkness enhances their visibility,"" the website also notes.

Time of year and time of day are two very important factors when choosing to see the Northern Lights on display in Iceland.

Tips for Northern Lights sightings

When it comes to seeing the magical dancing lights in the sky, there are a few factors that you may want to take into account in order to maximize your viewing pleasure.

Geomagnetic activity

When the geomagnetic field is active, the aurora will be brighter, stronger and further from the magnetic poles, according to the Space Weather Prediction Center (SWPC).

The best time to see the Northern Lights is when the planetary K index is at an eight or nine and the aurora moves toward the equator, the weather service site also said.

Location

There are so many places across the world to view the vivid display, but you'll want to make sure to find a location that has no obstructions.

Aim to find a place that has minimal tree lines or hills so that the northern horizon can be fully seen.

Darkness

Go at night, away from the city lights, in order to capture the best view of the Aurora Borealis.

""The full moon will also diminish the apparent brightness of the aurora (not the actual brightness),"" the SWPC continued.

Timing

The Northern Lights are usually on full display from September to March or April, but the best time to see the lights are in the late evening or early morning.

""Best aurora is usually within an hour or two of midnight (between 10 p.m. and 2 a.m. local time),"" the SWPC reported.

""There may be aurora in the evening and morning, but it is usually not as active and therefore, not as visually appealing.""",Northern Lights: Here are the best tips to help you spot the stunning display in the US and abroad,https://www.foxnews.com/lifestyle/northern-lights-here-best-tips-help-you-spot-stunning-display-us-abroad,FOX News - Lifestyle

For some reason — blame the encroaching winter, post-Halloween boredom, or simple copycat syndrome, you be the judge — November has become a big month for annual social-media-based collective challenges. From NaNoWriMo and NaPoWriMo to Movember and No-Shave November to, um, others, the extremely online crowd has focused on November as a month for group events and group discussion.

For cinephiles, the fun one of the batch is Noirvember, a collective urge to watch and compare noir movies. Unlike most of these other challenges, Noirvember doesn’t have an organizing website, a sponsor, a fundraising goal, or an established set of rules. (Though individual participants have certainly proposed some.) So for those participating — or for anyone looking for the best noir movies, or the best way to get into the classic genre for the first time — we’re offering a little help. Here are some of our favorites, for newbies and noir veterans alike.

The classics

Let’s start with a few seminal noirs, the basics you’ll want to hit to understand the genre and its conventions.

The Maltese Falcon (1941)

Director: John Huston

Where to watch: Rentable on Amazon, Vudu, Apple, YouTube

Probably the most famous noir movie of all time, John Huston’s adaptation of Dashiell Hammett’s 1930 crime movie covers the basics: There’s a hard-bitten detective, Sam Spade (Humphrey Bogart), on a case full of twists, turns, and double-crosses; a beautiful woman who lures him in and turns out to be full of lies; and a McGuffin everyone’s after that turns out to be more than it seems. A prime example of a noir that’s more about atmosphere, cinematography, and a complicated plot than about edge-of-the-seat thrills, The Maltese Falcon is a moody movie with a lot of great performances, but it’s also one of those films that’s been imitated and iterated on so much that it can feel a bit basic in comparison to its followers. Still, that also makes it one of those movies where watching it suddenly makes a thousand later cultural references and media in-jokes make sense. —Tasha Robinson

Sunset Boulevard (1950)

Director: Billy Wilder

Where to watch: Streaming on Paramount Plus, and free with a library card on Hoopla or Kanopy. Rentable on Amazon, Vudu, YouTube

Starting with one of the all-time great openings — has-been writer Joe Gillis (William Holden) wearily narrating over a shot of the police examining his floating corpse in a Los Angeles swimming pool — Sunset Boulevard is a stunner from start to finish. This one isn’t a crime procedural, like so many classic noirs; it’s about how Joe, out of work and fleeing the men trying to repossess his car, tries to find shelter with an aging movie star by promising to write her a comeback vehicle. He gets drawn into a drama he didn’t expect — a drama that’s exceptionally well acted and scripted. It’s dark stuff about Hollywood dreams and how they die, with Gloria Swanson at her most captivating and frightening. —TR

Double Indemnity (1944)

Director: Billy Wilder

Where to watch: Rentable on Amazon, Vudu, YouTube

Another Billy Wilder movie told in flashback, Double Indemnity is one of the great genre-defining femme fatale movies, with Barbara Stanwyck as the lovely lady leading hapless chump Fred MacMurray into an insurance fraud scheme that involves murdering her husband. It’s one of the great twist movies — everybody in this film is a potential double-crosser, and MacMurray as an insurance investigator is both tasked with solving the murder he committed and trying to cover it up at the same time. There’s enough going on here to keep anyone guessing up to the last minute. —TR

Next steps

Where to go after the basics? This is where noir fans’ mileage is going to vary most, based on which aspects of noir they like most. The mysteries? The fraught relationships? The twisty stories and unexpected reveals? Just the overall mood? Here are a few we’d recommend regardless of which subgenre you’re most into.

M (1931)

Director: Fritz Lang

Where to watch: Streaming on Max, The Criterion Channel, free with ads on Plex, and free with a library card on Kanopy. Rentable on Amazon, Vudu, Apple

One of the most chilling crime dramas ever put to film, M has an unbeatable premise: When a child murderer starts haunting the streets of Berlin and the police can’t find him, the local crime bosses join forces to bring him down. Something like a proto version of The Wire, jumping back and forth from the police perspective to the criminals’ side of things and humanizing people on both sides, M is a procedural with several unusual turns, built around a particularly memorable Peter Lorre performance. It’s also absolutely packed with breathtaking shots and exceptional use of light and dark, and the final manhunt sequence is a classic all-timer. —TR

Notorious (1946)

Director: Alfred Hitchcock

Where to watch: Streaming free with ads on Tubi, IndieFlix, FlixFling

Alfred Hitchcock’s Rebecca is a defining noir classic, but fans who haven’t dug past his topline roundup of classics shouldn’t miss the memorable Notorious, a thriller-romance featuring some of his most touching character work. Alicia Huberman (Ingrid Bergman), the daughter of a German war criminal, is asked to use that connection to seduce and spy on a prominent Nazi figure (Claude Rains) for the American government.

In the thinking of the time, this involves ruining herself for good men like her handler and love interest (Cary Grant) by having sex with another man. In modern eyes, this looks like the stuff anime romance dramas and fanfic are made of: Deferring her own desires for her country, Alicia willingly enters a love triangle and invites plenty of tsundere. Will duty win over love? Will she get any good spying done? Is Cary Grant the biggest self-righteous stuffed shirt imaginable in this movie? Bring on the feels. —TR

Digging deep

Follow anyone on social media who’s been at the Noirvember game for a while, and you’ll see plenty in this category: titles that lack a Billy Wilder or Humphrey Bogart to bring them into the cinematic limelight, but that have plenty of their own memorable charms. Here are a few we recommend for noir fans who’ve seen everything else.

Detour (1945)

Director: Edgar G. Ulmer

Where to watch: Streaming on Prime Video, Criterion Channel, free with ads on Pluto TV or Plex, and free with a library card on Kanopy

Edgar G. Ulmer was a prolific director in the Classic Hollywood era and directed the groundbreaking psychological thriller The Black Cat, the first movie to star horror legends Bela Lugosi and Boris Karloff. It was a huge hit for Universal. But Ulmer was blacklisted from most Hollywood studios shortly after, when his affair with the wife of Universal studio head Carl Laemmle’s nephew turned into a divorce and remarriage.

This is all necessary context for Detour, one of many micro-budget movies Ulmer made for Producers Releasing Corporation, the smallest of the Hollywood studios at the time. It’s also a standout example of film noir aesthetics and low-budget moviemaking.

Detour is about a down-on-his-luck young man hitchhiking from New York to Los Angeles to meet up with his love, who moved to Hollywood with the hopes of making it big. Along the way, he meets a mysterious stranger who upends everything.

Detour’s tiny budget gives the 66-minute film an odd aura, with sparse sets and back projection that is inconsistent at best. But the thing undoubtedly works — it’s a haunting movie about the unluckiest man in the universe, and Ulmer’s striking images (and an unforgettable performance by Ann Savage) through his evocative use of lighting paint a stark picture of an uncaring world. —Pete Volk

Sudden Fear (1952)

Director: David Miller

Where to watch: Streaming free with ads on Tubi, and free with a library card on Kanopy. Rentable on Amazon, Vudu, Apple

If you’ve never seen young Jack Palance and his startling cheekbones in a ’50s movie, this crime-and-seduction drama is worth it for that alone. But the real star of the show is Joan Crawford, in a particularly fantastic performance as a successful, wealthy playwright who winds up on both ends of a revenge scheme. When Myra Hudson (Crawford) boots handsome leading actor Lester Blaine (Palance) off her latest play because she doesn’t think he’s convincing as a romantic lead, and then he “just happens” to run into her, seduce her, and get her to fall for him, sharp viewers will think they know where this story is going. But that’ll only get them one twist down the magnificently curvy road in this movie. It’s another “everyone’s a potential double-crosser” story, directed with surprising style and a few winks at a noir-savvy audience. —TR

Born to Kill (1947)

Director: Robert Wise

Where to watch: Rentable on Amazon, Vudu

An openly Hitchcockian drama that feels like a matchup for Suspicion, Born to Kill does some particularly terrific plotting around the idea that it’s always exciting when the audience knows a lot more than the characters. Helen and Sam (Claire Trevor and Lawrence Tierney) are involved in different ways with the same double murder, but don’t realize it. When they meet and are attracted to each other, viewers will see the threat looming ahead even when both characters are oblivious. More murder, blackmail, cover-ups, and a great deal of double-dealing follow, enough to require a scorecard to follow the action. It’s a terrifically tense story where there’s no mystery about who did the killing, just about what or who audiences should root for. Do these two crazy kids have a future together? Does either deserve a future at all? And how many innocent bystanders are they going to take down with them? —TR

Lured (1947)

Director: Douglas Sirk

Where to watch: Streaming free with a library card on Hoopla or Kanopy, and free with ads on Roku. Rentable on Amazon, Vudu, YouTube

For people only familiar with Lucille Ball as a comedian, this strange crime thriller is a particular blast. American in London Sandra Carpenter (Ball) is working as a taxi dancer when a friend of hers disappears, possibly the victim of a serial killer who’s sending odd little poems to the police with every murder. The police ask Sandra to act as bait for the killer, which sends her on a bizarre, sometimes darkly hilarious tour of seedy London, as she answers lonely hearts ads and goes out to meet a series of strangers with the expectation that every one might be a murderer.

Ball is touchingly open-hearted in this movie, as a civilian who decides early on that she’s a hard-bitten cop like so many other noir protagonists. But this isn’t a satire or comedy — it’s more in the mode of M than The Naked Gun, with the focus on the noose tightening around the killer, and the sense that anyone Sandra meets could be a harmless kook or a deadly predator. —TR

Murder by Contract (1958)

Director: Irving Lerner

Where to watch: Streaming free with ads on Tubi

Murder by Contract is a lean, mean noir that had a big influence on Martin Scorsese. The director has listed it as one of his guilty pleasure movies — calling it the film that influenced him the most, especially in Taxi Driver. “The film puts us all to shame with its economy of style,” he wrote. “Murder By Contract was a favorite of neighborhood guys who didn’t know anything about movies. They just liked the film because they recognized something unique about it.”

In Murder by Contract, Vince Edwards plays a methodical hitman who is asked to kill a witness in a high-profile case. When he finds out his target is a woman, he bucks — not on moral grounds, but because women are harder to kill, due to how “unpredictable” they are.

Irving Lerner directs the movie masterfully on a minimal budget: It’s a tight 81 minutes, aided by Edwards’ fantastic performance in the leading role and a great all-guitar score from Perry Botkin. Catch up with a movie that inspired some of the greats, and learn more about film history in the process — all while having a great time. —PV

The neo-noirs

Search for “best neo-noirs” online, and you’ll get a thousand movies with dubious-at-best noir connections — practically all it takes to get a movie labeled as neo-noir is a voice-over, a procedural plot with a lot of night shots, or a downbeat ending. But there are plenty of movies that update the genre squarely and fairly, with an eye toward all the core conventions and the flavor that made noir such a memorable genre in the first place. Here are some of the best and most high-fidelity neos.

The Last Seduction (1994)

Director: John Dahl

Where to watch: Streaming on Peacock or free with ads on Tubi, Vudu, Roku, FreeVee, and Plex. Rentable at Amazon, Vudu, Apple

One of the most gleefully cruel, shockingly dirty neo-noirs to ever claim the name, The Last Seduction is a series of surprises that feels all the more subversive because the femme fatale is the protagonist, and there is no hero worth the label. Bridget Gregory (Linda Fiorentino) schemes with her patsy husband, Clay (Bill Pullman), to get her hands on a pile of illicit cash. Then she runs off with it and leaves him behind to take the fall. But she winds up stranded in a small town with time to kill and a second patsy to play with. This one gets particularly ugly by the end — it’s a dark, dark story — but there’s still a gleeful joy in the tightness of this narrative, and in Bridget’s sociopathic skill at coming up with a manipulation for every situation. —TR

Blood Simple (1984)

Directors: Joel Coen and Ethan Coen

Where to watch: Streaming on Max and The Criterion Channel. Rentable at Amazon, Vudu, Alamo, YouTube

Frances McDormand’s screen debut and the Coen brothers’ first movie is a must-see for neo-noir fans — the kind of tightly plotted, intensely acted, strikingly stylish movie they’d continue to be known for in the decades that followed. It was a memorable debut for all concerned. A Texas woman (McDormand) cheats on her thuggish husband (Dan Hedaya), who sets out to kill her and her lover. But everyone involved seems to have a hidden agenda, and the threads get pretty tangled as they all come to the surface, with twist after twist making the action memorable. Blood Simple puts the visual darkness implied in “noir” to particularly good work: It’s the kind of movie where someone is always either lurking in deep shadow or forced off into a symbolic darkness that they might or might not come back from alive. —TR

Brick (2005)

Director: Rian Johnson

Where to watch: Rentable on Amazon, Vudu, Redbox

For fans: possibly the best ever neo-noir not made by the Coen brothers. For detractors: a weird “Is this serious or satire?” experience built around a mannered, oddball script that reduces noir to a literal high school teen drama. (Actually, the fans might agree with every part of that second description, and just mean it much more positively.)

Joseph Gordon-Levitt stars as the hard-bitten PI equivalent, a high school kid devoted to a girl who jilted him, then turned up dead. Johnson’s script (presaging his later, equally complex murder mysteries Knives Out and Glass Onion) treats high school drama like big-time drama, and puts Dashiell Hammett-style dialogue in the mouths of modern teenagers, for an effect that’s a wee bit comedic and a whole lot of fun. This one’s full of fun surprises, but it also respects the genre and plays fair by noir fans rather than subverting the classics. —TR

Bad Times at the El Royale (2018)

Director: Drew Goddard

A star-studded, charisma-packed murder-thriller told out of order, in the kind of layered “and here’s what was going on with this other character at the same time” narrative that hangs plenty of Chekhovian guns on the wall for the final act, Bad Times at the El Royale is an underrated blast. Featuring Cynthia Erivo in a star-making role, Chris Hemsworth in a part that makes the most of his sex appeal, and plenty of other familiar names (Jon Hamm, Dakota Johnson, Nick Offerman, Jeff Bridges) doing what they do, this one’s a powder keg of a movie that assembles a motley crew of unrelated guests (or are they?) at a seedy motel, then keeps revealing secrets in a deliriously dizzy way as it all comes together. —TR

No, not that Twilight. There isn’t a sparkle-vampire in sight in this celebrity-crammed, steamy crime drama. But if you have a Noirvember buddy or viewing group, we recommend springing this on them at the last minute: “Hey, we’re watching Twilight tonight!” If they don’t break your neck and throw you under a train, Double Indemnity-style, they’ll probably thank you after watching this one, a surprisingly winning (and winningly surprising) crime drama starring Paul Newman, Susan Sarandon, Gene Hackman, Reese Witherspoon, Stockard Channing, James Garner, Giancarlo Esposito, Liev Schreiber, Margo Martindale, M. Emmet Walsh… It’s the kind of movie where you can play “Oh wow, they’re in this movie too?” in almost every scene. —TR

Winter is coming, as the clocks go backwards one hour at 2am on Sunday 29 October.

This will give us an extra hour in bed as we prepare for the colder months when the sun sets earlier and days get significantly shorter.

The clocks won’t go forward again until Sunday 31 March 2024.

Even so, the debate as to whether we should continue to comply with Daylight Saving Time (DST) protocols continues to run rife.

Many academics, scientists and campaigners have called for the abolition of the clock turning-tradition, citing improvements to mental and physical health, public safety and wellbeing.

But what are the advantages of such a decision? We speak to the experts to get the low-down on the issue.

Annual energy savings of £400

Professor Aoife Foley from Queen’s University Belfast has calculated that household consumers could save more than £400 per year from their electricity bill depending on their tariff if the government scrapped DST at the end of October.

Dr Foley, who specialises in clean energy research, estimates that we could save £1.20 a day and dramatically reduce demand on the National Grid.

“By simply foregoing the winter DST in October, we save energy because it is brighter in the evening during winter, so we reduce commercial and residential electrical demand as people leave work earlier, and go home earlier, meaning less lighting and heating is needed,” she said.

During winter, evening energy demand peaks between 5pm and 7pm, with UK households potentially facing three-hour power cuts this winter, the National Grid has warned, due to a shortage of gas.

“We are no longer in an energy crisis in Europe but an energy war and, dependent on weather conditions this winter, it is very likely we may need to start rationing energy very seriously to avoid bigger energy issues in December and January when gas reserves start to run low,” adds Professor Foley.

“There is no doubt that by foregoing the DST in winter we would save a lot of energy, reduce our bills and carbon emissions during this energy war, especially during a cost of living crisis.”

Fewer road accidents

The Royal Society for the Prevention of Accidents (RoSPA) has called for the abolition of DST, arguing that turning the clocks back increases the risk of road accidents, due to more people driving during darker winter months.

The Society has urged the UK government to adopt British Summer Time on a permanent basis.

“RoSPA is in favour of this proposal, and is calling for the government to adopt British Summer Time (GMT+1) all year,” the society states.

“This would mean road users will no longer experience the sudden onset of darkness during their autumn commutes, potentially saving many lives.”

And they’re not alone. The Royal Society for the Prevention of Accidents also supports the call to abolish DST, citing figures from the RAC Foundation which state that road traffic collisions increase by 19 per cent in the fortnight after putting the clocks back one hour from British Summer Time, reducing by 11 per cent when we put the clocks forward.

Increased immunity

Getting a good night’s sleep during the winter months is essential in protecting us against the seasonal increase in colds and flu. Research shows that even a small reduction in sleep has been shown to impact your immune system, however.

Making the move from daylight saving time interferes with your natural circadian rhythm, the 24-hour biological cycle that is influenced by morning light and evening darkness, however.

“It’s hard to understate the importance of a good night’s sleep,” says Giulia Guerrini, lead pharmacist of digital pharmacy Medino. “Having too much or too little sleep can have adverse side effects, so you should aim to get between seven and eight hours of sleep as consistently as possible.”

Never underestimate the value of a good night’s sleep (Getty)

“One of the biggest disruptors to our sleep is when UK clocks go forward one hour at 1am on the last Sunday in March and go back one hour at 2am on the last Sunday in October, which is rapidly approaching on 30 October.

“One of the most important aspects of a healthy sleep schedule is waking up around the same time each morning, so try to limit yourself to a one-hour window if you need to adjust when you get up in the morning and when you go to sleep at night. One hour sounds like an insignificant amount of time, but it can completely throw our circadian rhythm, or more simply known as internal clock, off balance,” he says.

Despite this, a spokesperson for Sleep School, a science-based sleep education and therapy service, told The Independent that it is “impartial” on the extent to which the clocks changing impacts sleep, arguing that the important factor is the duration of time asleep and a consistent schedule.

Fewer depressive episodes

A Danish study from 2017 of more than 185,000 people over 15 years found that the transition from summer time to standard time was associated with an 11 per cent rise in depressive episodes. Conversely, the switch from winter to summer time was found to have no effect.

People frequently report an increase in SAD and depressive symptoms in winter (Getty/iStock)

“This study shows that the transition from summer time to standard time was associated with an increase in the incidence rate of unipolar depressive episodes,” the study authors concluded. “Distress associated with the sudden advancement of sunset, marking the coming of a long period of short days, may explain this finding.”

A drop in heart attacks

Not everyone is convinced, however. Charlie Morley, author of Wake Up to Sleep, cites a 2014 study by the College of Cardiology, which reported a significant drop in heart attacks in the 24 hours immediately following turning back the clocks.

“Fascinatingly, each year when the clocks go back for Daylight Saving and 1.6 billion people across 70 countries gain an extra hour in bed, there is a 21 per cent decrease in heart attacks the next day,” he says. “There’s also a big drop in suicides and car crashes worldwide. That all adds up to tens of thousands of fewer deaths around the world from just one extra hour of sleep.”

When did Daylight Saving Time begin?

The UK first introduced Daylight Saving Time in 1916 when the government introduced British Summer Time (BST) to encourage people to spend more time outdoors in daylight.

The change hasn’t always proved popular, however, with the European parliament voting in favour of scrapping DST in 2019, a change that was due to take effect for the first time in 2021, but plans have been stalled.

A 2019 YouGov poll found that the majority of Brits were marginally in favour of keeping DST, however, with 44 per cent electing to keep the current system, while 39 per cent voted in favour of ditching the change.",When do the clocks change in 2023?,https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/health-and-families/when-do-clocks-change-october-dst-b2434829.html,The Independent - Life and Style
entertainment,Wenlei Ma,2023-10-01T14:00:47+00:00,"When Noora Niasari was five years old, she lived in a women’s shelter with her Iranian mother. They were fleeing family violence in a country that wasn’t entirely familiar, trying to make a new life.

That personal experience has informed Niasari’s debut feature, Shayda, which has been storming the global festival circuit since it premiered at Sundance film festival in January, winning an audience award. Released in Australia on 5 October, the film has already claimed the top prize at CinefestOz, opened the Melbourne international film festival, and been selected to represent Australia in the international film category at the Oscars.

It’s a sensational reception for a first film, particularly given the specificity of its story: Shayda is a dramatisation of Niasari’s early life, set in the Iranian diaspora community of suburban Melbourne. “It was something I had experienced, but I hadn’t really seen on screen before,” Niasari says of the movie she started thinking about straight after finishing film school. “But I first had to ask my mum for her permission and participation, because I had such a blurry memory of that time.”

Niasari asked her mother to write her memoirs, which took six months; that writing formed the basis of the first incarnation of Shayda’s script. Shayda evolved over time – and it’s not always a direct mirror of what happened to them both – but “it is very emotionally true to our experience”.

Executive produced by Cate Blanchett, Niasari’s movie tells the story of Shayda (Zar Amir Ebrahimi), an Iranian immigrant in Melbourne who leaves her abusive husband Hossein (Osamah Sami) with her daughter Mona (Selina Zahednia) in tow. Shayda finds refuge in a women’s shelter where the kindly Joyce (Leah Purcell) protects and guides her through the tough legal process of a custody fight.

It’s a tender and revealing film that balances Shayda’s discovery of inner strength with the sacrifices she makes for her daughter, as she tries to create a new family for her. It’s understated, relatable and drawn from such personal memories that Niasara describes working on it as “long-term exposure therapy”. Even doing interviews to promote the movie is difficult. “I have to sit with it and process it,” she says.

“But the thing is, now that it’s a film, it has a really different energy in the world. People bring their own experiences to it, it’s a very universal experience. We’ve screened it in Europe, North America and Australia and there is a real sense that it connects beyond my mother and I, beyond our experience. It’s not about us any more. That feels liberating and cathartic.”

The world is seeing the strength of Iranian women now Noora Niasari

After screenings, adult men have approached her with their own tales of growing up in shelters; other audiences have said they left with a deeper understanding of different Iranian women’s experiences.

It was important to Niasari to shade in light along with the darkness of family violence. Shayda’s story may be centred on escaping abuse and fighting for custody of her child, but it’s also about friendship, music, dance, laughter and reclaiming freedom. There’s something elementally hopeful about the film.

“I always wanted to find that balance in the story because … it’s life, there are ups and downs,” she says. A large part of the film is devoted to the character holding on to the rituals of Persian New Year, and finding a way to connect with her culture amid the upheaval.

“For her, that’s through music and poetry and dance, and sharing that with her daughter. It became fundamental to the story. That was how I grew up as well. We’re in the Australian suburbs but I lived in a Persian house with my mum’s cooking and music.

‘The world is seeing the strength of Iranian women now; it’s not just me looking at my mum in admiration,’ says Niasari. Photograph: Miff

“I grew up with all of the beauty of our culture. So I had a natural inclination to include those moments [in the film]. You can feel the joyous moments even deeper when you have that tension or darkness around it.”

It has been a year since 22-year-old Iranian woman Mahsa Amini died in custody, after being arrested for allegedly not complying with the country’s hijab laws. Her death led to a huge wave of popular unrest in Iran; Niasari hopes renewed international awareness of Iranian women’s resistance will lead to more stories being told.

“The world is seeing the strength of Iranian women now; it’s not just me looking at my mum in admiration. Shayda is just one of those women who happened to leave Iran and make her own sacrifices and her own life.

“It’s more and more important to showcase the diaspora experience as well, especially given what’s happening in the world with displacement, exile and migration due to conditions in the country. So, I’m really optimistic about the storytellers coming through and being able to tell a different kind of story.”","Shayda director Noora Niasari on family violence, Iranian liberation and taking her first film to the Oscars",https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/oct/02/shayda-film-director-noora-niasari,The Guardian

In an interview with Fox News Digital, Morgan – who is set to release his EP ""Enlisted"" – shared how he's been able to balance his successful music career while simultaneously re-enlisting in the U.S. Army Reserve.

""Well, that's easy for me because I spent 18, almost 18 years of my life in it. So my mental capacity in that arena has never changed. In fact, that's easier for me than this music stuff most of the time,"" Morgan said.

""There's a term once a soldier, always a soldier. For me, I have never quit being a soldier, even though I was no longer actually serving in the capacity of a service member on duty. In my head, I've always been a soldier and I always will be,"" he continued.

""I'm proud, I'm honored, and I'm humbled to be a part of what I think is some of the greatest Americans in our country,"" Morgan continued.

""Less than 1% of the people in this nation – and I say this every night upstate – less than 1% of the people in our nation serve in this military and right now, recruiting is worse than it's ever been. So, we're going to do everything we can to try to encourage people to serve our country and to understand that it's not about self, and it's not even really about government.""

Craig noted that joining the Army is all about being a part of something that is ""so much bigger than yourself.""

""There's a sense of pride and humility, two words that are very seldom able to coincide. And I tell people all the time, I think the military is one of the few places where that takes place. Law enforcement service to our country is where you can be very proud and humble at the same time. It's a different kind of pride, not an arrogant pride. It's a sense, a sense of humility, and I'm humbled beyond words to be able to be a part of that again,"" Morgan said.

The biggest challenge when Morgan was in active duty was the time commitment. He told Fox News Digital that there were moments when he was away from his family for a year at a time. When he was serving his country, it was not only his dedication that mattered but theirs as well.

WATCH: Craig Morgan believes the 'most challenging' part about serving in the military is 'time'

""It not only requires a lot of dedication on the soldier's part, but dedication on the family's part. It's tough. It's very tough,"" he explained. Although there are challenges when joining the military, to Morgan the reward is worth it.

""The reward, again, is being around people that I think are some of the greatest Americans in the world,"" he said.

Morgan says he balances his music career and being a member of the U.S. Army Reserve with a lot of ""coordination.""

""So, all I really have to do is show up and do the one important thing and that's sing and entertain,"" he said of his music career.

""The military, on the other hand, requires a lot more of my personal thought process. I don't have someone making my schedule for me. So there's a lot of coordination going on between the military side and my civilian side.""

entertainment,Chris Plante,2023-11-09T18:00:00+00:00,"In early 2022, Valve released my favorite video game console. But even I had some gripes. With the Steam Deck, I could — for the first time — play the bulk of my sprawling collection of video games wherever I’d like. But I tended to bundle it with a huge portable power supply. I also couldn’t quite shirk how much better games looked on our family’s OLED TV.

And yet, for me, an adult with limited time to play video games alone in a quiet room, nothing could beat the Steam Deck’s freedom. Barring the occasional diversion, Valve’s handheld PC had served as my preferred gaming option ever since I published our review. Then, last week, the Steam Deck OLED arrived. It’s as if the Steam Deck team collected a laundry list of complaints about the original, then responded to all of them one by one.

When we award the Polygon Recommends badge, it’s because we believe the recipient is uniquely thought-provoking, entertaining, inventive, or fun — and worth fitting into your schedule.

It appears, at first glance, that Valve cribbed from Nintendo’s playbook with the Switch OLED, for which Nintendo upgraded the device’s screen but not its guts. In terms of raw power, the Steam Deck OLED is identical to the original Steam Deck. Valve says this synchronicity is meant in part to continue to provide developers with a single goal when optimizing their games — though it promises that the Steam Deck 2 (which the company hopes to release in two to three years) will have a generational power leap.

For those who haven’t tried a Steam Deck, though, I wouldn’t wait for its sequel. Because while Valve hasn’t upped the horsepower, it has improved practically everything else. The Steam Deck OLED has longer battery life, faster Wi-Fi, and a stand-alone Bluetooth module. And the screen isn’t just OLED; it’s HDR OLED — the first HDR OLED screen on any gaming portable, with a peak brightness of 1,000 nits for HDR content and 600 nits for SDR (for comparison, the original screen’s peak brightness was 400 nits). And somehow, with all of these additions, the Steam Deck OLED is lighter.

So, goodbye, old Steam Deck; hello, new Steam Deck.

The Steam Deck OLED delivers on Valve’s original promise

OLED is in the name for a reason.

The OLED panel in the new Steam Deck is lighter, thinner, and more power efficient than its LCD predecessor. It’s also bigger and faster. Though the device has the same shape as the original Steam Deck, smaller screen bezels allow for a display that’s slightly larger, at 7.4 inches compared to 7 inches. The panel has a wider color gamut (110% DCI-P3, for the visual obsessives) and the beautiful, inky blacks that OLED dorks like myself adore.

Steam Deck OLED’s bigger, better battery Valve’s promise of 30-50% more battery raised one obvious question: Is that comparing the OLED model with a Steam Deck running its original firmware (which had poor battery life), or a Steam Deck using the latest firmware? Valve’s answer: the latter! So if you’re a Steam Deck owner, expect those big battery improvements over your current Steam Deck experience.

The OLED panel also has a 90 Hz refresh rate — perfect for frame doubling from 45 frames per second. In case that jargon means nothing to you, suffice it to say that gameplay on the Steam Deck OLED looks smoother. The improved 90 Hz refresh rate falls short of the Asus ROG Ally’s 120 Hz, though it’s worth considering that the higher the frame rate, the faster the battery drain — assuming you can even spot the difference between 90 Hz and 120 Hz.

You know what’s more interesting than a list of technical specs? Actually seeing the screen. It’s gorgeous. On Sunday morning, I picked at Sega’s Like a Dragon Gaiden: The Man Who Erased His Name while watching football and Christmas movies with my family. The new Yakuza game looks fantastic on high settings at 60 fps, its night sequences flaunting the OLED’s dark blacks and the abundance of neon signage showcasing the HDR.

I got so distracted pulverizing bad dudes that it took me some time to notice the Steam Deck OLED’s most welcome feat. When playing AAA games on the original Steam Deck, I had always kept the handheld plugged into an outlet. But with the OLED model, a couple of hours had passed before I realized I’d forgotten to connect the charger.

The OLED screen makes for a fancier Steam Deck, but it’s the battery life (and some tweaks throughout the design to carve out more of it) that lets Valve’s new handheld truly deliver on its promise of a portable gaming PC.

All the tiny, delightful improvements of Steam Deck OLED

Since the original Steam Deck launched, Valve has been improving the hardware through updates — its team estimates around 300 to date. That will continue with both the Steam Deck OLED and the original Steam Deck, the latter of which will get a fresh BIOS update to align itself with some of the former’s upgrades. The original device will see some battery life improvement; just don’t expect the OLED model’s jump of 30-50%.

Some changes — even smallish ones — demand new hardware. And so, alongside the big improvements, Valve has made a gaggle of minor physical upgrades with its new iteration. The Steam Deck OLED now includes a Wi-Fi 6E radio (great if you have a modern router and connection to make use of it) and a dedicated Bluetooth module, which allows for improved audio quality with wireless headphones, the option to wake the Steam Deck from a controller, and the capability to connect many Bluetooth controllers for multiplayer. The haptics are noticeably improved, with a wider frequency range. And the touchscreen is markedly better — it’s responsive to the point where I don’t feel the need to plug in a USB-C keyboard anytime I need to type a few words.

A review for spec specifics If you’re the sort of person who likes the nitty-gritty technical details of screens and batteries, we also recommend reading The Verge’s review.

Valve also claims that the Steam Deck OLED is more repairable, which, mercifully, I didn’t have the need to test for myself. (Parts will once again be sold through iFixit.) However, I did enjoy the new power supply, with its faster charging (45 minutes gets you from 20% to 80%) and 2.5-meter cable that stretches the length of my couch.

One small, charming detail: The carrying case now has a tinier carrying case within it. If you want to be extra cautious, stick to the original bulky case. But if you need to toss the Steam Deck in your backpack for a day trip? Go with the slim case that has funny little thumbstick nipples!

All of the tweaks, large and small, amount to a perfect handheld — made better by the price, which remains the same as the original Steam Deck available today, just that the OLED will come with more stuff. Valve will be selling three models:

$649 - 1 TB OLED (up from 512 GB)

$529 - 512 GB OLED (up from 256 GB)

$399 - 256 GB non-OLED Steam Deck (up from 64 GB)

Plus, for a limited time, the company will offer a special edition 1 TB Steam Deck OLED made with a translucent shell for $679 — only in the U.S. and Canada. Though let’s be real: This thing will sell like hotcakes and Valve will reconsider the definition of “limited supply.” Have I considered ordering one of these limited editions? Yes. But I am also practicing restraint. Like, how many Steam Decks should one human have?

I suppose that’s the question, really. If you already have a Steam Deck, is the OLED model technically an incremental improvement? Yes. But you might find that the screen and the battery justify the double dip. For someone like me, who puts hundreds of hours into the Steam Deck each year, the upgrade is inescapable.

And if you don’t have a Steam Deck? How many times can I say it: This is my favorite console ever. And it just got better.

The Steam Deck OLED will be available Nov. 16 to purchase through the Steam storefront. The hardware was reviewed with a unit provided by Valve. Vox Media has affiliate partnerships.

It may be over a decade since Britney Spears and Kevin Federline ended their marriage, but the former couple continue to have their ups and downs when it comes to co-parenting their two teenage sons, Sean Preston and Jayden.

Ahead of the release of the pop star’s memoir, The Woman in Me, which is due for release on 24 October, fans are anticipating Spears will share new details about her relationship with her second husband, Federline.

Spears has previously been open about her co-parenting struggles with Federline. Last year, he claimed their children were keeping their distance from Spears, who was embracing her newfound freedom following the end of her 13-year long conservatorship by posting several nude images on social media.

From marriage to divorce to co-parenting, here is a complete timeline of the drama between Britney Spears and Kevin Federline.

The “Toxic” singer and the former backup dancer began their whirlwind romance back in 2004, when Federline worked as a backup dancer for Justin Timberlake. Federline recalled his first meeting with Spears to People back in 2008.

“I met her at a club in Hollywood, Joseph’s. Our eyes met and that was it. We just hit it off right away,” he said. “I learned real fast how much of a whirlwind the press and everything was.”

After just three months of dating, the two tied the knot in September 2004 during a surprise wedding ceremony in Studio City, California. Federline was 26 years old at the time, while Spears was just 22. Earlier that year, Spears was also married to her childhood friend Jason Alexander, but their marriage was annulled after just 55 hours.

The former couple welcomed their first child, son Sean Preston, weeks before their one-year wedding anniversary, and their second son Jayden James in 2006. At the time, Federline was already a parent to his daughter Kori Madison, now 21, and son Kaleb Michael, 19, with ex fiancée Shar Jackson.

Just eight weeks after the birth of their second child, Spears filed for divorce from Federline in November 2006, citing “irreconcilable differences”. In the couple’s initial divorce settlement, which was finalised in July 2007, they were granted joint legal and physical custody over their two children.

Spears suffered a mental breakdown in 2008 and was placed on a 5150 psychiatric hold, leaving Federline to retain sole custody of their boys. In February of that year, Spears entered into a conservatorship with her father Jamie Spears, who took complete control over her assets.

Since Spears and Federline’s divorce, it seemed the two were amicably co-parenting their sons when they were seen supporting their boys at their soccer and football games. Federline moved on to his now wife Victoria Prince. The two share daughters Jordan Kay, 12, and Peyton Marie, nine.

In 2018, things took a turn when Federline requested an increase of $20,000 a month more child support payments from Spears. After months of court discussions, Federline rejected Spears’s child support proposal and instead doubled his request to $40k a month. A settlement was finally reached between the two parties in September 2018, with Spears increasing her child support payments to Federline from $20,000 to $35,000 a month.

Amid her father’s health crisis and ongoing emotional distress, Spears voluntarily checked into a mental health treatment facility in 2019. After hearing the news, Federline’s attorney Mark Kaplan told Entertainment Tonight: “Kevin commends Britney for recognising that she needs to take a step back and that she is taking the reasonable steps to dealing with her situation in a responsible way. He wishes everyone well.” That same year, Federline was granted 70 percent custodial rights and Spears 30 per cent.

After years with her father in control of her finances and personal life, Spears was finally granted freedom from her conservatorship in November 2021. The singer made a powerful testimony at her conservatorship hearing that June, where she spoke out for the first time about her experience, calling for those involved to be “put in jail”. Following the testimony, Federline expressed his support for the singer, saying he “only hopes the best for her because when the best for her is achieved, it’s the best for their kids.”

“The best thing would be for their mom to be healthy and happy,” his lawyer said in a statement at the time. “And if either of those things aren’t true, it doesn’t provide for the best setting for custody to be exercised.”

In June 2022, Spears married her longtime boyfriend Sam Asghari during an intimate ceremony at their Los Angeles home, just one month after the singer revealed she suffered a miscarriage.

While celebrities like Madonna, Paris Hilton, and Selena Gomez attended the festivities, Spears’ close family – her mother Lynne, father Jamie, sister Jamie-Lynn, and her two sons – were not present at the nuptials.

Although their marriage last only 14 months, with Asghari filing for divorce in August this year, the actor and former dancer was previously praised by fans over his continuing support for Spears amid her conservatorship and custody battle.

In August 2022, Federline claimed during an interview with ITV that their teenage sons found it “tough” seeing their mother sharing nude photos online, saying: “I can’t imagine how it feels to be a teenager having to go to high school.”

Spears hit back at her ex-husband in a statement shared to her Instagram Stories responding to Federline’s “hurtful” comments. “It saddens me to hear that my ex husband has decided to discuss the relationship between me and my children … As we all know, raising teenage boys is never easy for anyone,” she wrote. “It concerns me the fact that the reason is based on my Instagram … It was LONG before Instagram … I gave them everything … Only one word: HURTFUL.”

Asghari went on to accuse Federline of using their sons to “vilify” his wife, and claimed her ex-husband’s “gravy train will end soon, which probably explains the timing of these hurtful statements.”

“There is no validity to his statement regarding the kids distancing themselves and it is irresponsible to make that statement publicly,” Asghari wrote on Instagram.

Following Federline’s comments, Spears’s attorney Mathew Rosengart said in a statement obtained by Variety that Federline has created “legal issues” for himself, after posting private videos of Spears sternly speaking with her children without her consent.

“Whether he realises it or not, Mr Federline has not only violated the privacy and dignity of the mother of his children, he has undermined his own children, whose privacy he should protect,” the statement read. “Putting aside his ITV interview, Mr Federline’s ill-advised decision to post an old video of his 11 and 12-year-old children was cruel, bottom of the barrel stuff. It was abhorrent.”

“In addition to demeaning himself and violating societal norms, he has now also created various legal issues for himself, including, but not limited to, implicating cyber-harassment and cyber-bullying statutes, among other things.”

Jada Pinkett Smith has revealed why she and her husband Will Smith never signed a prenuptial agreement before getting married.

The former talk show host, 52, spoke candidly about her husband during a recent interview with Parade. While discussing her new memoir, Worthy, Jada revealed that she and Will didn’t sign a prenup when they were married in 1997 because they knew divorce wasn’t in the cards for them.

“Listen, weddings are beautiful, but they can be very romanticised,” Jada said. “I feel that was a very real moment for the two of us to look each other in the eyes, recognise that there would be tough times in this journey and to say to each other: ‘No matter what, we’re going to figure it out and that’s why we don’t need a prenup, because I’m making a promise that divorce won’t be necessary, that we will figure this out.’”

The Girls Trip star explained how she and Will casually promised not to get a divorce, and how that decision impacted their perspective on on marriage.

“And we made that promise to each other without all of the bridal wedding beauty; it was just sitting on a log in his mother’s backyard, and going: ‘Hey’ - having to really look at the possibility of us not being together,” she said.

This isn’t the first time that Jada has opened up about her long-term commitment to her husband. During an interview with Hoda Kotb for Today, which aired on 13 October, the actor confirmed that she and her partner have been living “completely separate lives” for the past seven years. However, according to Jada, their choice to live in separate homes doesn’t mean that they’ll be getting divorced anytime soon.

“I made a promise that there will never be a reason for us to get a divorce,” she said. “We will work through whatever. And I just haven’t been able to break that promise.”

When asked why she and Will didn’t “just amicably divorce,” Jada simply replied: “We don’t want to.”

She then explained how her family shaped that decision, as she and the King Richard star share two children - Jaden, 25, and Willow, 22. Will also has a 30-year-old son, Trey, who he shares with ex-wife Sheree Zampino. “We love our family and we love each other. It’s more of a life partnership,"" Jada explained. ""Now, 10 years from now, Hoda, who knows?”

During a 2018 episode of her Facebook Watch series, Red Table Talk, Jada doubled down on her stance about divorce, as she recalled the the hard conversation she had with Will about the topic before they got married.

“I told Will from the gate, I said let me tell you something: ‘If you marry me, know this: we’re gonna be together. We’re going to be under the same roof,’” she said. “For me personally, I’m not mature enough to have a divorce, I’m just not. I don’t think I would ever be mature enough, I don’t.”

The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air star has also shared similar sentiments, as he said during an appearance on the Ellen Degeneres Show that “divorce just can’t be an option” for him and Jada. “It’s really that simple. And I think that’s the problem with LA - there are so many options. So a huge part of the success for [Jada] and I is that we just removed the other options.”

Last week, Jada made headlines when she revealed that at the time of the 2022 Academy Awards, when Will slapped Chris Rock, she and her husband had been separated for six years. “We’ve been doing some really heavy-duty work together,” she said during an interview with People. “We just got deep love for each other and we are going to figure out what that looks like for us.”

Jada then praised her children for how they’ve helped her grow, adding: “My children, they’re little gurus. They’ve taught me a deep sense of self-acceptance.”

On 16 October, Will broke his silence on his wife’s comments during an interview with the New York Times. The outlet noted that he said his partner’s memoir “kind of woke him up” and that he has now realised she is more “resilient, clever and compassionate than he’d understood”.

“When you’ve been with someone for more than half of your life, a sort of emotional blindness sets in, and you can all too easily lose your sensitivity to their hidden nuances and subtle beauties,” Will added.",Jada Pinkett Smith reveals why she and Will Smith never signed a prenup,https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/jada-pinkett-will-smith-prenup-b2430529.html,The Independent - Life and Style
entertainment,Pete Volk,2023-11-03T22:15:00+00:00,"Happy Friday, Polygon readers! Each week, we round up the most notable releases to streaming and video rental, highlighting the biggest and best new movies for you to watch at home.

This week’s biggest debut is Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse, which is now streaming on Netflix. That’s not all, as Insidious: The Red Door — the fifth installment in the Insidious horror franchise — also arrives on the platform this week alongside Jawan, one of the biggest Indian action movies of the year. There’s plenty more exciting releases this week too, with A Haunting in Venice now streaming on Hulu, the Italian superhero movie Freaks vs. the Reich on Prime Video, plus the premiere of The Kill Room and Outlaw Johnny Black from director-star Michael Jai White on VOD.

Here’s everything new to watch this weekend!

New on Netflix

Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse

Where to watch: Available to stream on Netflix

Genre: Superhero action

Run time: 2h 20m

Director: Joaquim Dos Santos, Kemp Powers, Justin K. Thompson

Cast: Shameik Moore, Hailee Steinfeld, Oscar Isaac

The highly anticipated follow-up to 2018’s Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse sees Miles Morales facing off not only against a dimension-hopping nemesis in the form of the Spot, but a whole multiverse of Spider-Mans, Spider-People, and even a Spider-Dinosaur as he attempts to save the day once again.

From our multiversal review:

Not every theme and plot and moment in Across the Spider-Verse lands, particularly with the other part of this story still most of a year away. But in the end, the theme of the Spider-Verse movies is shaping up to be a story about people trying to be bigger and bolder themselves, trying to reach beyond what they’re told they’re capable of, and do more. It’s no wonder that every part of Across the Spider-Verse is an attempt to outdo the first movie. The idea of growing, of surpassing and ignoring everyone else’s limits, is the heart of this series’ heroes and their individual journeys. It looks like the movies themselves are designed to follow suit.

Jawan

Where to watch: Available to stream on Netflix

Genre: Action thriller

Run time: 2h 50m

Director: Atlee

Cast: Shah Rukh Khan, Nayanthara, Vijay Sethupathi

The biggest Indian movie of the year has landed on Netflix. Directed by Atlee (Mersal), Jawan features megastar Shah Rukh Khan (between this and Pathaan, he is truly back) and is basically “Robin Hood meets Charlie’s Angels.”

Insidious: The Red Door

Where to watch: Available to stream on Netflix Saturday

Genre: Supernatural horror

Run time: 1h 47m

Director: Patrick Wilson

Cast: Ty Simpkins, Patrick Wilson, Rose Byrne

The fifth movie in the Insidious franchise is the directorial debut for star Patrick Wilson. It’s also a sequel to Insidious: Chapter 2, as the last two movies in the franchise were prequels.

From our review:

As a director, Wilson isn’t as effortless a horror ringmaster as Wan or Whannell: He favors more actor-centric scares than wild imagery. But he makes great use of expressive close-ups (often of himself) and shallow focus, with a few creepy It Follows-like shots of blurry figures approaching from the distance, and a terrifically claustrophobic scene inside an MRI machine. Dalton’s college story, meanwhile, occasionally borders on campus-prank zaniness: It includes what can only be described as a puke ghost, and there’s one amusing use of the horror movie cliche about the haunted little kid who makes terrifying drawings of the ghouls only he can see. (Naturally, that kid grows up to become a star pupil in an insufferable freshman art class.)

Sly

Where to watch: Available to stream on Netflix

Genre: Documentary

Run time: 1h 35m

Director: Thom Zimny

Cast: Sylvester Stallone, Arnold Schwarzenegger, Quentin Tarantino

This documentary takes a close look at the life of one of the great American movie stars and film writers: Sylvester Stallone.

Nyad

Run time: 2h 1m

Directors: Jimmy Chin, Elizabeth Chai Vasarhelyi

Cast: Jodie Foster, Annette Bening, Rhys Ifans

Nyad tells the (questionably) true story of swimmer Diana Nyad, who swam from Cuba to Florida at 64 years old, among many other swimming accomplishments.

Wingwomen

Where to watch: Available to stream on Netflix

Genre: Action

Run time: 1h 56m

Director: Mélanie Laurent

Cast: Mélanie Laurent, Adèle Exarchopoulos, Isabelle Adjani

Mélanie Laurent (Inglourious Basterds) is both behind and in front of the camera in this action comedy about women thieves on the run looking to pull off one last job.

New on Hulu

A Haunting in Venice

Where to watch: Available to stream on Hulu

Genre: Horror mystery

Run time: 1h 43m

Director: Kenneth Branagh

Cast: Kenneth Branagh, Michelle Yeoh, Jamie Dornan

Kenneth Branagh’s Poirot adaptations have generally been a fun time, even when they have problems (looking at you, Death on the Nile). A Haunting in Venice is his best yet, as Branagh’s confidence as director and performer in this mode only continues to grow. It’s perfect fall viewing.

Quiz Lady

Where to watch: Available to stream on Hulu

Genre: Comedy

Run time: 1h 39m

Director: Jessica Yu

Cast: Awkwafina, Sandra Oh, Will Ferrell

Sandra Oh and Awkwafina play a pair of estranged sisters who try to win big on a game show to pay off their mom’s debts. The supporting cast includes Will Ferrell, Jason Schwartzman, Tony Hale, and the late Paul Reubens.

New on Prime Video

Freaks vs. the Reich

Where to watch: Available to stream on Prime Video

Genre: Superhero/circus war movie

Run time: 2h 21m

Director: Gabriele Mainetti

Cast: Claudio Santamaria, Aurora Giovinazzo, Pietro Castellitto

This offbeat Italian superhero movie follows a group of circus performers in World War II who are sought after by the Nazis and team up to stop them. I have heard it’s funny, sweet, and has strong action — definitely on my weekend watchlist.

New on Peacock

My Big Fat Greek Wedding 3

Where to watch: Available to stream on Peacock

Genre: Romantic comedy

Run time: 1h 32m

Director: Nia Vardalos

Cast: Nia Vardalos, John Corbett, Louis Mandylor

One of cinema’s most endearingly goofy families is back, in the most family-centric franchise this side of the Fast and Furious movies. It’s the first Greek Wedding movie since 2016, which came nearly 15 years after the original smash hit. This time, star-writer Nia Vardalos takes over directorial duties, following up her 2009 directorial debut I Hate Valentine’s Day.

New on AMC Plus

Sympathy for the Devil

Where to watch: Available to stream on AMC Plus

Genre: Psychological thriller

Run time: 1h 30m

Director: Yuval Adler

Cast: Nicolas Cage, Joel Kinnaman

A largely two-person movie that sounds a bit like Collateral, Sympathy for the Devil stars Nicolas Cage as a passenger who holds a driver (Joel Kinnaman) hostage on a long car trip.

The Kill Room

Sound of Freedom

Where to watch: Available to rent on Amazon, Apple, and Vudu

Genre: Crime thriller

Run time: 2h 11m

Director: Alejandro Gómez Monteverde

Cast: Jim Caviezel, Mira Sorvino, Bill Camp

One of the most surprising (and controversial) box-office hits of the year, Sound of Freedom purports to be a true story about stopping child trafficking. The truth is much more complicated than that.","Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse on Netflix, A Haunting in Venice, and every new movie to watch this weekend",https://www.polygon.com/2023/11/3/23938342/new-movies-watch-spider-man-across-spider-verse-netflix-jawan-haunting-venice-hulu,Polygon
entertainment,Grayson Morley,2023-10-16T14:00:00+00:00,"“Those slavering jaws; the lolling tongue; the rime of saliva on the grizzled chops.”

This is Angela Carter, not on Venom, but on the wolf from “Little Red Riding Hood” in The Bloody Chamber, her collection of reimagined folk and fairy tales. It’s actually from “The Company of Wolves,” which is one of three retellings of “Little Red Riding Hood” in the collection, each with its own spin on the familiar tale.

If you want curated lists of our favorite media, check out What to Play and What to Watch .

Retellings are compelling because they allow writers to toy with readers’ preconceived notions of how the story “should go,” both in terms of genre conventions and in terms of plot. We know Little Red Riding Hood will go to her grandmother’s house, where she will find that her grandmother has been eaten by a wolf, just as we know Spider-Man will be bitten by a radioactive spider. The fun, both for the author and the reader, comes in deviating from those norms — in finding new ways to tell old tales.

With Marvel’s Spider-Man 2, Insomniac Games attempts something similar.

Mainstream Spider-Man stories are increasingly Spider-Men stories, and Spider-Man 2, the third Spidey game from Insomniac, is no different. You play as both the yassified Peter Parker from Spider-Man Remastered and Miles Morales from his eponymous debut in 2020, switching between the two at your leisure with all the speed afforded by the PlayStation 5’s SSD.

In fact, speed is one of the primary improvements on display in the first PS5-exclusive Spider-Man game. New to the series are web wings, which allow the Spider-Mans to fly through the city, gliding over rooftops and gaining speed from wind tunnels without needing to rely on buildings, bridges, or other anchors for web-slinging. (They’re especially useful when crossing the East River into the newly added Brooklyn and Queens.) Web-swinging is faster now as well, enhancing that ineffable feeling of being Spider-Man as you glide through New York with ease. Whether you’re playing as Miles or Peter, traversing the three available boroughs is an undeniable joy — so much so that I found myself using fast travel less frequently than in the previous two games, because movement felt that much more fluid.

Of the two Spider-Mans, it’s Miles who feels more alive with the possibility to break free of expectation and canon

Narratively, juggling two Spider-Mans requires a different kind of deftness. Two villains new to the series take center stage — Kraven the Hunter and Venom — as well as a returning cast of nearly every villain from the previous two games. Without delving into spoilers, a large majority of that cast is sidelined early on, leaving Kraven and Venom as our principal antagonists, albeit with large roles for returning villains the Lizard (who made a brief appearance in Miles Morales) and Mister Negative. There are others besides them that should delight comic fans, setting up future conflicts for either expansions or the presumed Spider-Man 3 to tackle. If what you come to Spider-Man for is spectacle and villainy, Spider-Man 2 has the goods and then some.

As for our heroes, Miles and Peter return from their individual outings for a dramatic team-up. Their two stories are threaded together, allowing for randomized encounters where Peter might show up while you’re playing as Miles (or vice versa), with the two of you tag-teaming a random criminal and slamming them into the ground in what feels like the world’s least fair fight. And yes, they do the Spider-Man-pointing-at-Spider-Man meme in-game. And yes, it is charming the first time (though maybe less so the second). The main story sometimes swaps Spider-Mans mid-mission, as in the dramatic opening sequence where Sandman coats the city in dust as Peter and Miles rush to help firefighters and first responders, with eerie echoes of 9/11. Side missions often allow either Spider-Man to tackle them, but the main story beats require one or the other, as each hero is allowed his full particularity as a singular Spider-Man.

Peter’s plot involves a retelling of the Venom origin story, with beats that will be recognizable to those even passingly familiar with the Spider-Man mythos. If Spider-Man 2 is a game of retellings, Peter’s story clings most closely to the canon. If you’ve seen Sam Raimi’s Spider-Man 3, you’ll know the gist of what to expect when the symbiote finds its way to Peter. It isn’t until the late game that Peter’s story starts pushing more strongly against our canonical memories and into something more unique to Insomniac.

Miles’ story takes more liberties. Hailey Cooper, Miles’ love interest from his solo game, returns here, taking more of an MJ-esque role and carving out her own identity separate from Miles’. American Sign Language is featured heavily throughout Miles’ missions because of Hailey’s presence, feeling as natural and integral to the story as anything from the canon. One of the Miles-specific side quests involves learning about the artistic history of Harlem, and it entwines the real-life histories of Josephine Baker, Langston Hughes, and Charlie Parker with the fictional history of SHIELD and other Marvel properties. An early mission shows off Insomniac’s technical chops with a section that cleverly borrows a trick from Ratchet & Clank: Rift Apart. Of the two Spider-Mans, it’s Miles who feels more alive with the possibility to break free of expectation and canon.

[Ed. note: Spoilers follow for Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse.]

The recent Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse has an obsession with “canon events,” pivotal moments in a Spider-Man’s life that the film’s villain, Spider-Man 2099, is dedicated to maintaining across the multiverse. Whether it’s the upside-down kiss, the death of Uncle Ben or Jefferson Davis, or simply the spider bite that starts it all, Spider-Man 2099 believes that upholding these canon events, even the painful ones, is key to preserving the stability of each strand of reality. Miles disagrees, believing it is Spider-Man’s job to resist the seemingly inevitable — to always do what’s right, not simply what’s preordained. The film ends with a promise of pushing back against Spider-Man 2099, and with it, the established canon.

I was hungry for Spider-Man 2 to push back in a similar way — to treat the established story like Angela Carter repurposing “Little Red Riding Hood” to her whims, like Michael Cunningham plumbing “Rumpelstiltskin” for a story about the desire to have a child, or like Helen Oyeyemi and her body of work. Or, to give a more mass media example, like Star Wars: Visions, which gives creative leeway to a variety of animators and storytellers to play with the very basics of what makes Star Wars Star Wars.

Spider-Man 2 doesn’t go quite this far, but where it does go is still satisfyingly slant. Wrinkles to critical characters and plot points will keep even seasoned Spider-fans on their toes. Moreover, it plays like a dream, with smart additions to combat that enhance the power fantasy of being Spider-Man. Each Spider-Man now has a full arsenal of special moves and gadgets that complement one another, making even the most basic combat encounter feel like a choreographed ballet of kicks, thwips, and zaps. The game is beautifully rendered, taking full advantage of the newest PlayStation, with such detailed textures on each unlockable suit that you’d swear they were real, and ray-traced window after ray-traced window in a loving rendition of New York. (If you can get past the Frankenstein-ification of the boroughs, that is. RIP Chelsea.)

There are hints of greater thematic aspirations within Spider-Man 2. Questions about mass incarceration, recidivism, and reintegration into society for formerly incarcerated people; worries about the surveillance state and what we give up when we engage with modern technology. These things appear, however fleetingly, in Spider-Man 2, but there isn’t enough time to elaborate on any single one in the unrelenting march of set-piece after glorious set-piece.

But I’m glad they’re there, anyway. Because if we’re going to retell a story, we ought to retell it anew. Canons were made to be broken, and Spider-Man 2 swings in that direction. With a sequel teed up by the game’s final act, I’m eager to see where Insomniac goes with that momentum. Next stop: the Bronx.

entertainment,Jesse Hassenger,2023-10-26T21:11:01+00:00,"The possessed-animatronics horror video game Five Nights at Freddy’s is less than a decade old, but a movie version has been in the works almost since the game launched, which seems especially protracted for a development process. Warner Bros. bought the movie rights in 2015, and the project moved over to Blumhouse a couple of years later. Game creator Scott Cawthon wrote and rewrote the script, while kid-horror filmmakers like Gil Kenan (Monster House) and Chris Columbus (Gremlins, the first Harry Potter and Percy Jackson movies) signed on and jumped off the project.

Finally, under director Emma Tammi, the film is hitting theaters simultaneously with a Peacock streaming debut. The franchise’s most hardcore fans probably consider themselves beyond ready to watch the Freddy’s film. But what about everyone else? If you’re not sure, have a look at this handy (and extremely spoiler-light) Q&A. We don’t dig into the considerable lore behind FNAF here — there are endless YouTube videos for that. We’re mostly talking about who this film is for and what to expect.

Does Five Nights at Freddy’s have a post-credits scene?

Yes. More specifically, it has a brief mid-credits scene that rolls less than a minute after the initial cut to black. It isn’t integral to the movie’s lore, and doesn’t feel like a sequel tease, though it certainly could be elaborated on in a sequel. It’s more of a comic scene involving YouTuber and horror-game aficionado Cory DeVante “CoryxKenshin” Williams, though he doesn’t seem to be playing himself. But as far as a true post-credits scene that actually plays at the tail end of the credit roll, Five Nights at Freddy’s doesn’t have one — just a brief, not especially exciting audio-only Easter egg.

Can you enjoy Five Nights at Freddy’s if you haven’t played the games?

At a Blumhouse panel for the recent New York Comic Con, producer Jason Blum explained that he thinks a lot of adaptations — books, comics, and games alike — falter when creators try to simultaneously please hardcore fans and remain accessible to new audiences. According to Blum, his company finally cracked Five Nights at Freddy’s by deciding not to make it with new audiences in mind. In other words, they ultimately decided to just please the fans.

It was a clear applause-bait line at a convention filled to the brim with, yes, fans. But that doesn’t mean the movie is hard to follow. It starts from scratch, mimicking the premise of the first game: A guy named Mike (Josh Hutcherson) is hired as overnight security guard for an abandoned Chuck E. Cheese-style arcade restaurant, and encounters some animatronics with strange and eerie origins. There’s no comics-style backstory that demands pre-movie study.

Still, complete newcomers checking out the movie to see what the fuss is about may be confused for other reasons. The movie’s backstory is parceled out awkwardly, in ways that are sometimes confusing. Characters’ decisions don’t always make sense. And there’s as much family melodrama as thrill-ride scares. There isn’t much you can do about it except assure yourself that any confusion you experience in watching it isn’t just you. The movie is kind of weird, and not because of some missing fan-only information that unlocks all its inconsistencies. The for-the-fans vibe Blum described applies more to whether the average person will care about this story, not whether they can understand it.

Will Five Nights at Freddy’s experts enjoy the movie more?

Longtime fans hungering for an exploration or expansion of the game series’ continuing mythology should prepare themselves to see something more simplified. Typical enough for an adaptation, some of the more complicated lore has been stripped out, though it could probably be reintroduced in any sequel. This does make the movie more accessible for franchise newcomers, whether Blum wanted that or not.

Also, fans might expect more screen time than they actually get for the core animatronics team of Freddy, Bonnie, Chica, Foxy, and Carl the Cupcake.

Is Five Nights at Freddy’s safe for kids?

For an ostensible horror franchise — one based on nostalgia for and subversion of animatronic characters that date to the 1980s — the Five Nights at Freddy’s games have a surprising amount of young fans. Its kid appeal is an echo of a time when playgrounds were alight with elementary school kids describing the antics of Freddy and/or Jason, whether witnessed firsthand or pieced together from rumors. Unlike A Nightmare on Elm Street or Friday the 13th, however, Freddy’s is rated PG-13, rather than R.

So is it really as kid-friendly as other PG-13 IP movies, like Aquaman or Captain Marvel? That will depend a lot on the kid in question, of course, but the movie is far from an unrelenting thrill ride. It isn’t as intense as fellow PG-13 horror movies The Ring or Drag Me to Hell. The most ghoulish aspects of the Freddy’s backstory are kept off screen or entirely unmentioned, and none of its set-pieces seem like pure nightmare fuel. Several of the titular five nights pass without much incident at all.

That said, there are plentiful cheap music-sting jump scares and a few gruesome bits of junior-level gore. Violence-wise, this is a harder PG-13 than your average superhero movie, which will probably only entice its younger YouTube-versed fans even more. Again, every kid is different, but generally speaking, that 12 or 13 age cutoff is probably about right.

Wasn’t there already a horror movie about evil animatronics?

Yes! Five Nights at Freddy’s took so long to get the movie treatment that it was actually lapped by a spirited knockoff. Willy’s Wonderland doesn’t have nearly so much lore as the FNAF games, but its premise is basically One Night at Cage’s, with Nicolas Cage playing a man hired to serve as an overnight janitor at a haunted Chuck E. Cheese-type location. As expected, the interesting element of the movie is Cage’s performance — especially because it’s entirely dialogue-free, muting one of Cage’s most distinctive features as an actor.

The novelty isn’t quite enough for Willy’s Wonderland to reach the upper echelon of Cage’s last decade, but hardcore fans of either the actor or the concept might enjoy the strange combination of a unique movie-star brand with an off-brand version of the famous game series. And a total Five Nights novice might even prefer the sillier, shorter Cage version.",5 things to know before watching the Five Nights at Freddy’s movie,https://www.polygon.com/23933705/five-nights-at-freddys-fnaf-movie-post-credits-scene-faq-too-scary-for-kids,Polygon
entertainment,,2023-10-31T20:13:41+00:00,"For most kids, Halloween is all about how much candy they can stuff in their bags or buckets.

But for some kids, such as those with autism, the activity can be a little more daunting.

The blue Halloween bucket trend first started in 2018, when Louisiana mom Alicia Plumer took to Facebook indicating that her son, who has autism, would be carrying a blue bucket to indicate his disability.

BLUE HALLOWEEN BUCKETS RAISE AUTISM AWARENESS, MOM'S VIRAL POST SAYS

""If you see someone who appears to be an adult dressed up to trick-or-treat this year carrying this blue bucket, he’s our son!"" she wrote. ""His name is BJ & he is autistic. While he has the body of a 21-year-old, he loves Halloween.""

She added, ""Please help us keep his spirit alive and happy. So when you see the blue bucket, share a piece of candy. Spread awareness! These precious people are not ‘too big’ to trick-or-treat.""

Another mom, Omairis Taylor, wrote in a 2019 Facebook post that many neighbors expected her nonverbal, autistic son to say ""trick-or-treat"" to earn candy, leading the mother to explain over and over why he was unable to do so.

Many Facebook users praised the idea of the blue bucket, one commenting how it is ""one more tool to broaden the scope of understanding.""

'OUTGROWING' AUTISM? FOR SOME KIDS, THE DISORDER SEEMS TO DISAPPEAR BY AGE 6, ‘ENCOURAGING’ STUDY FINDS

Parents across the country and retailers like Walmart have since joined in buying and selling blue Halloween baskets to raise awareness for trick-or-treaters with autism.

The National Autism Association recognized the movement as well, warning in a 2020 blog post that not all parents find the color coding necessary.

Some parents are concerned that blue buckets unnecessarily point out their child’s disability, and could even make them a target for abuse.

The argument continues this Halloween season, with some X users pointing out the controversy.

LOS ANGELES MOM SAY KIDS WITH AUTISM DON'T NEED ‘FIXING,’ URGES GREATER UNDERSTANDING AMID SPIKE IN CASES

""DO NOT BUY YOUR CHILDREN BLUE HALLOWEEN PUMPKIN BUCKETS,"" one X user posted on Monday.

""This idea, aside from being horribly ableist, as it's intended to denote the child as ‘different’ (read: autistic) harms children w/dietary needs. Teal pumpkins = hypoallergenic needs/options & this idea muddies that message.""

Another user posted, ""I know this has the best of intentions ... But we don't need blue pumpkin buckets for Halloween. Non-verbal kids don't need to be identified during a fun holiday, they just want to participate like everyone else.""

Parenting expert and child psychologist Dr. Michele Borba commented on the controversy, telling Fox News Digital that it’s ""always advisable not to label a child — unless it’s for a positive reason.""

CALIFORNIA MAN WITH SEVERE AUTISM BEATS RUBIK'S CUBE WORLD RECORD: ‘EXUBERANCE IN OUR HEARTS’

""Negative labels can impact a child’s self-confidence,"" said the California-based psychologist. ""But no one knows a child better than a parent.""

Borba suggested that parents should consider whether the label hurts or helps their child interact with others.

""For instance, is the child speech delayed? Does he have difficulty interacting with others or expressing his needs? Are others (including his peers) aware of the child’s challenges?"" she questioned.

""The ultimate goal is for the child to have a fun Halloween,"" Borba said. ""The parents should never be concerned about others’ responses; only do what is best for [the] child.""

Kelley Coleman, Los Angeles-based author of the upcoming book, ""Everything No One Tells You About Parenting a Disabled Child,"" echoed this sentiment, emphasizing to Fox News Digital how Halloween should ""always be about your child.""

For parents considering using a blue bucket, Coleman — who is also the mother of an autistic son — advised others to take their children's safety, comfort and privacy into consideration.

""Especially for children trick-or-treating without parents directly at their side — is it the safest option to have your child carrying a bright indicator of their disability?"" she asked.

""For children who prefer privacy, would they want that information broadcasted? For children who prefer to share their neurodivergence, perhaps this is something they are proud to display.""

The conversation should be between child and parent, Coleman stressed, regardless of communication level, and should ""center their experience and preferences.""

""The blue bucket can be a teaching tool for others; however, it should never be about others — it should always be about your child.""

""In an ideal world, all adults would understand that not everyone communicates the same way, and that one's ability to communicate does not indicate one's interest in candy,"" she said. ""But, the reality is that not all adults know this.""

entertainment,Autumn Wright,2023-10-19T19:00:00+00:00,"Many players have celebrated The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild for the space it made to find queer expression in Hyrule. Its story provided just enough possibility space for players to explore in ways that did not conform to its developers’ intent. But stepping into Hyrule Field again in Tears of the Kingdom, I felt much more constrained.

Players have been looking for gender in this generation’s iteration of Link since before Breath of the Wild released. Donning his tunic’s now iconic champion blue, Link’s androgyny in the game’s very first teaser trailer back in 2014 stirred mainstream audiences to scrutinize the player character’s presumed gender. And as early as that had come into question, so too did the character’s entire identity. The idea of a female Hero of Time simmered. And if the character shown wasn’t Link, then maybe it was a playable Zelda.

Nintendo would eventually address the speculation: Zelda producer Eiji Aonuma said that nothing so revolutionary as a woman was in the works, explaining that changing Link’s gender would “mess with the balance of the Triforce,” while focusing instead on Zelda as a playable female character would leave Link with nothing to do. “If we have princess Zelda as the main character who fights,” Aonuma asked, “then what is Link going to do?”

These assumptions and their casual misogyny reveal that particular kinds of gender are a priori to the very land and cosmos of Hyrule — that the Triforce both represents and enshrines the subordination of women to men in the kingdom’s religion, and that courage and power must only be an essential trait of men. Many fans have been disappointed in Zelda’s continued sidelining, while the developer has been content to give Zelda little to do in her eponymous games. While his developers imagine Link as a blank slate for players of all identities, Sarah Stang contends that Link’s gender expression has never been incorporated into that vision. “Though featuring an androgynous protagonist can be viewed as progressive in a Western context,” she argues, “Link’s design fits in with Japanese cultural preferences and was therefore not an overly risky choice for Nintendo.”

Breath of the Wild’s gender trouble continued closer to release, as a series of leaked screenshots revealed Link’s encounter with the character Vilia outside of Gerudo Town, the all-female city in Hyrule’s desert. The screenshots suggested a transphobic punchline about crossdressing, and the game would deliver on the joke (the quest being a necessary step to completing the game’s true ending). But when the game was released weeks later, players went on to find queer expression and even joy in the wilds of Hyrule. A crossdressing Link was genuinely embraced among artists, cosplayers, and authors of fan fiction, and queer expressions were captured in poetry, art and prose.

All of which is why I find Tears of The Kingdom so damning — it denies such space for imagination. Its narrative is ultimately not just a perpetuation of Hyrule’s status quo, but it introduces new constraints that deny queer subtext and even expression where once there was room before. And we can tease out these changes by going back to the fulcrum of gender discourse in Breath of the Wild: Gerudo Town.

Gerudo Town is a gendered and raced space unlike the other settlements on the periphery of Hyrule. Alongside the bird people, fish people, and rock people, the Gerudo are a vaguely Arabic or North African-coded, all female, matriarchal society. Their culture is a site of friction and humor in both games. The Gerudo are at once obsessed with and scornful of men, found on pilgrimages to find their one true love, a monogamous myth perpetuated by their own teachings, or else behind the walls of their single-gender desert city.

Women of all races (and the apparently genderless Gorons) are welcome in Gerudo Town, while men are prevented from entering by armed guard. In Breath of the Wild, many still try their luck, with several characters’ whole personalities being a one-note joke about how it’s funny to watch men chase after women when they wish to be left alone. But the Gerudo do not themselves police gender. Vilia, who can be read as a trans woman, is said to be welcomed in the city, and Link is welcomed in when he dons their attire. He seems comfortable, if bashful, when he first puts on the clothes. Moreover, when Link reveals himself at the city’s health-replenishing spa, the innkeeper Romah implores him to relax. “We’re all vai here,” she assures, using the fictional language’s word for “woman.” Many more compliment Link’s appearance in strictly feminine terms. As both the Gerudo chieftain Riju and armor shopkeep Greta address Link as if he’s in disguise, we can infer that many perhaps see Link as a non-conforming person moving through the city.

The presence of a black-market armor shop further denies any gender essentialist notions like the ones that suggest Vilia is a man dressed as a woman. In Breath of the Wild, the shop’s covert dealings of Gerudo armor for men suggests that there must be men in the all-female race, leaving one to assume trans men may be born of the Gerudo and, while not sanctioned in the city, are integrated into their material culture. But Tears of the Kingdom does away with almost all of the queer subtext brimming just beneath Breath of the Wild’s surface.

Vilia is one of a handful of named characters missing from Tears of the Kingdom, and there is no mention of her memory. The armor she gifted Link, which was once previously for sale in Gerudo Town’s market, is also conspicuously absent, just one of a few pieces of clothing to not return to the game. Instead, the game’s main quest takes players into a derelict Gerudo Town. Link must again infiltrate their sanctum (now an underground bunker), but this time he is welcomed as a man amongst the sheltering women. Moving through the now underground settlement, Link is greeted with suspicion and novelty to the sheltered children who have not seen men before, and he’s treated as a presumed threat for his proximity. Gerudo Town previously rejected essentialist logics like the idea men are inherently dangerous to women — which undergirds real-world transphobia — but here it simply invokes such beliefs in much less humorous tones than it did even in Vilia’s quest.

And outside of town, a Hylian man mentions to Link that he’s looking for a black market armor shop that sells voe (Gerudo for “man”) armor. The change transforms queer materials into something more like cultural tchotchkes, further denying the queer subtext of trans masculinity and furthering the sense of Orientalism pervading the Gerudo.

Tears of the Kingdom does introduce new armor sets that can play with expression, but none are explicitly feminine. Most are Zonai in origin, a fictional ancient culture that borrows heavily from pan-Mesoamerican and Egyptian imagery. As such, it’s hard to read their skirts and body paint as feminine when these were features of masculine presentation to their cultures. I guess there is the one-off Cece’s Hat, designed by a Hylian in Hateno, but it lacks a matching set of top and bottoms. So, there’s nothing really replacing the gender nonconformity that the vai armor introduced in Breath of the Wild. But this would perhaps be less notable if Link’s gender presentation wasn’t so ridiculed across Hyrule.

What pervades the land in place of calamity is not the evil of Ganon, but of gender deviance. In Tears of the Kingdom, characters often make jokes emasculating Link. At one stable, a Lurelin refugee laughs at the notion that “a skinny little guy” might attempt to rescue his village, while a Gerudo pilgrim jokes with Link that he couldn’t possibly be her destined lover. More than one Gerudo remarks on his short stature, while others reject the notion he may be the famed hero of time because he’s so short. The Great Fairy Mija, however fond of him, describes Link as “a slim little lad” in what is framed as a backhanded compliment. These comments envelop Hyrule with gendered expectations, much like gendered beauty standards and social norms do in our own world.

It turns out queer joy was only accepted in the empty, unstructured wilds of a Hyrule beholden to calamity. But in a world that has been filled by side quests and the new settlements of a monarchy reborn, there is no need for a hero who wears a skirt like a girl. Tears of the Kingdom presents a Hyrule where the Triforce rests not in the trinity of the spiritual aspects of Power, Courage, and Wisdom, but instead in the gender binary.",How queerness became calamity in Tears of the Kingdom,https://www.polygon.com/23922313/legend-of-zelda-tears-kingdom-totk-queer-gender-link,Polygon

It’s a great month for adult animation, with both the Scott Pilgrim animated show and Blue Eye Samurai hitting Netflix this month. Also, there’s the Squid Game reality show — because right, that’s a thing — and a new season of The Crown. But this month, we’re highlighting The Social Network, with another new David Fincher movie on its way to Netflix... but not for the reasons you probably think.

Editor’s Pick: The Social Network

Hey, did you know that there’s a popular fan theory that bestselling romantic comedy Red, White, and Royal Blue started off as fanfic of The Social Network? Well, now you do!

I could talk about how with each passing year, David Fincher’s Mark Zuckerberg biopic grows increasingly more relevant, as Facebook’s (excuse me, Meta’s) grip on the internet becomes stronger, but that’s been done to the death. Instead, I’m going to praise both Jesse Eisenberg and Andrew Garfield for their electric performances and their zinging chemistry. Come for the Facebook and Mark Zuckerberg origin story, stay for the tale of doomed friendship (and maybe write a fanfic about it?).

Also, this is a great November movie because of the autumnal shots of Harvard and the Winklevoss twins rowing. Impeccable vibes to fuel the dark academia aesthetic TikTok videos.

Don McLean, the iconic artist and musician behind the mega-hit ""American Pie"" and other well-known hit songs, has just released a new album of classic Christmas tunes — and shared a personal connection to one of the songs with Fox News Digital in an exclusive phone interview this week.

He said ""Silent Night,"" which he performs on the album, ""was my mother's favorite song that I used to sing at Christmastime for her.""

He added, ""It's powerful. It's a powerful song.""

‘AMERICAN PIE’ ICON DON MCLEAN ON AI: ‘IT’LL BE BETTER THAN WHAT PASSES ITSELF OFF AS MUSIC TODAY'

The Grammy-award honoree, Songwriters Hall of Fame member and BBC Lifetime Achievement Award recipient's ""Christmas Memories: Remixed & Remastered"" features McLean's take on other such Christmas classics and beloved holiday standards as ""Winter Wonderland,"" ""Let It Snow,"" ""The Burgundeon Carol,"" ""White Christmas,"" and more.

He said that after he and his band re-recorded and remixed ""Winter Wonderland,"" for instance, featuring bass player Jim Ferguson on the new version, he told the others, ""My God, this sounds like a whole different song.""

The refreshed and upgraded songs felt so ""dynamic"" to him, he said, compelling him to want to get out the new album this holiday season.

Speaking of the Christmas season, McLean — born in New Rochelle, New York — said that ""the holidays are a time for families to come together. I remember as a kid sitting around the record player and listening to music with my family. We all had our favorites, which we played over and over again.""

DON MCLEAN OF ‘AMERICAN PIE’ FAME TELLS FOX NEWS DIGITAL, ‘I DID THE RIGHT THING WITH MY LIFE’

He said that ""all the greats from Bing Crosby to Gene Autry influenced me — so I've included my version of their classics on ‘Christmas Memories: Remixed & Remastered.'""

McLean is working all the time, he told Fox News Digital.

""American Boys,"" another new album of his, is coming out in February 2024 — and he's getting ready to tour again in the U.S.

His touring schedule in the year ahead may take him to the Far East, he suggested.

""As you may have remembered, the president of South Korea [Yoon Suk Yeol] sang ‘American Pie’ to our president in the White House this year — it was a big story, and he got a guitar signed by me,"" McLean said of the state dinner event held by the Biden White House on April 26.

McLean's recent tours over the past two years have celebrated the now 50-plus anniversary of ""American Pie,"" the 8½-minute folk-rock ballad and cultural touchstone about the loss of innocence among the early rock ‘n’ roll generation.

Music ""can help you. It can help you feel better — but we have to get over things. We have to get over stuff."" — Don McLean to Fox News Digital

After spending eight weeks on the charts, the song hit No. 1 on the Billboard chart on Jan. 15, 1972, noted the History Channel's website.

ON THIS DAY IN HISTORY, OCTOBER 2, 1945, ‘AMERICAN PIE’ SINGER-SONGWRITER DON MCLEAN IS BORN

""American Pie"" held the record for longest No. 1 song on the Billboard 100 for nearly half a century, until it was broken in Nov. 2021 when ""All Too Well (10 Minute Version) (Taylor's Version)"" by Taylor Swift hit No. 1 at a length of 10 minutes and 13 seconds.

""There is something to be said for a great song that has staying power,"" McLean told Billboard at the time.

In addition, a new children's book based on his song ""Vincent"" (""Starry, Starry Night"") is in the pipeline and there's been a great deal of renewed interest in ""Vincent,"" his tribute to tortured artist Vincent van Gogh, he said.

""Vincent"" was the second single off his ""American Pie"" album. The song was a hit both in the U.S. and the U.K., landing at No. 1 on the singles chart in England.

On social media even in 2023, fans of the song continue to pour out personal feelings and insights about it — with some even saying they've broken down in tears upon hearing the song again after many years.

""I am here to tell you: [People] do feel things, but they don't have anybody out there who's giving them anything to feel.""

McLean said, ""I want to share something on this point. Jack Nicholson, who is a very smart man, said something very important here. He said, 'I don't think the American public wants to be moved anymore.' He doesn't think people want to feel things. And I am here to tell you: They do feel things, but they don't have anybody out there who's giving them anything to feel.""

He went on, ""It's all spectacle and empty. For example, we have a terribly, terribly empty political situation right now. I've never seen anything like it in my life. Everywhere you look, there's an empty suit. Nobody's got any brains. They don't know how to use the English language — it's pathetic.""

McLean said that ""this is where music comes in. It can help you. It can help you feel better — but we have to get over things. We have to get over stuff. Like our grandparents and our parents did — they got over things. People are going to experience things, but they need to get over them.""

Of the enduring force and affect of music, McLean added, ""Think of 9/11. Buildings were toppling over. New York City was closed down. Terrible. But you can't close music down. A song exists on a record, of course, but then it exists in the minds of millions of people. And so it's a monument, in a way. It's a very powerful thing.""

""You can't close music down. A song exists on a record, of course, but then it exists in the minds of millions of people.""

And ""I realized when I was young guy that I didn't want to be a poet. I didn't want to be an actor or a playwright or any of those things. I wanted to write songs and sing songs. And so I think people cling to these things. That's why they're memorable. That's why they've lasted so long.""

He added, ""People go home to them. They're home.""

McLean was recently inducted by the Nashville Convention & Visitors Corp. into the Music City Walk of Fame. Along with other artists, he was recognized for his significant work in ""preserving the musical heritage of Nashville and for contributing to the world through song,"" according to a media statement.

In receiving that honor, McLean was inducted by Connie Valens — sister of the late Ritchie Valens, whose death he immortalized in ""American Pie.""

Also, in 2017, that song's composition was added to the Library of Congress National Recording Registry. Over the years, the song has been covered by the likes of Madonna and Garth Brooks.

McLean has sold over 50 million albums worldwide, according to press information.

He has a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame, was a 2022 inductee into the Musicians Hall of Fame, received a star on the Las Vegas Walk of Fame — and was recently the focus of a Paramount+ documentary ""The Day The Music Died.""","At Christmas, Don McLean sings the praises of 'Silent Night,' other holiday classics: 'My mother's favorite'",https://www.foxnews.com/lifestyle/at-christmas-don-mclean-sings-praises-silent-night-other-classics-my-mother-favorite-song,FOX News - Lifestyle

We’ve all been there. A friend’s wedding is three days away and you don’t have anything to wear. The last thing you want to do is drag yourself around high-street shops, so inevitably you turn to ASOS. After all, the company is known for its next day delivery and easy returns service.

Though many of us are reliant on the online fast fashion retailer for last-minute holiday purchases or big seasonal shops, a new report shows that ASOS’s pre-tax losses ballooned to almost £300m in the year to 3 September, compared with £31m the previous year, according to the results published on Wednesday (1 November).

Despite its huge popularity, the once undisputed queen of online retailers now faces stiff competition from abroad, challenging economic headwinds, and a maturing clientele potentially seeking a more tailored experience. Leading some to ask, is ASOS in SOS?

When ASOS was launched in 2000, the online retailer was considered revolutionary. It was like a supersize department store at your fingertips and became the first online retailer that UK customers could visit and find hundreds of dresses for £30 all in one place.

But, in recent years, the company has been cutting its stock as it faces severe profit and revenue losses. In July and August, the retailer said it was hit by wet during the summer months, forcing the retailer to cut its stock by 30 per cent.

Some experts now say that the holes within ASOS’s business model are becoming apparent. Rick Smith, Managing Director of business recovery firm Forbes Burton tells The Independent that ASOS’s business model of allowing large numbers of free returns makes the company susceptible to financial losses during challenging economic conditions.

“The buying culture within their target demographic sees several items returned for each order placed, which can make for slim profit margins,” Smith explains. “ASOS has enjoyed a stratospheric rise since their inception, but have perhaps reached their ceiling now and need to cut their cloth accordingly, especially given the amount of economic headwinds [such as as the cost of living crisis] in play at the moment.”

The buying habits of consumers have also shifted in the 23 years since ASOS launched. Smith says that sifting through hundreds of products has become a painstaking and often unenjoyable task for its customers.

“Once large online retailers get to a certain size, it can become laborious for customers to scour their whole catalogue,” Smith explains. “The online fashion landscape is evolving now to a point that customers are looking for a more tailored service from websites.”

With the rise of shopping on social media, too, young people are increasingly buying individual items from retailers on Instagram and TikTok or instead shopping directly from the brands that ASOS stocks, such as Pull and Bear, Stüssy and Bershka, which all have their own websites.

ASOS distribution centre near Barnsley, South Yorkshire. (PA)

“ASOS’s busy 20-something [target] market doesn’t necessarily have the time to sift through dozens of item pages,” adds Smith. “So curated collections and recommendations based on user input may be one of the changes they eventually look at.”

ASOS, which originally stood for As Seen On Screen, initially started trading with the tagline “Buy what you see on film and TV” as it exclusively sold imitations of clothing worn by celebrities. That business model quickly expanded away from the world of replica products: ASOS now offers 850 affordable to mid-range high-street brands and ships to 196 countries.

But the company is also now tackling a debt issue, with net debt including leases now at £648.5m, up from £533m the year before. Analysts predict that the online fashion site may need to raise quick cash soon – potentially through the rumoured sale of its Topshop brand, which ASOS acquired when the Arcadia Group went bust in 2021 and closed Topshop’s bricks and mortar stores.

Despite the profit slump and predicted future losses, José Antonio Ramos Calamonte, ASOS’s chief executive, said in the report that the company has made “good progress” in “a very challenging environment” and would continue to invest in its brand and stock more fashionable lines of clothing.

The company plans to spend £30m more on marketing and said it was going “back to fashion” with its products “geared around fashion and excitement”.

As ASOS faces huge losses, it was reported this week that the Chinese-founded retailer Shein has acquired UK company Missguided, with plans to “reignite” the online retailer that was only bought out of administration by Mike Ashley’s Frasers Group a year and a half ago.

Despite calls for boycotts from anti-fashion campaigners, Shein is currently valued at around £53bn, having expanded globally and bought many of its rival brands. In 2022, it was the most-googled fashion brand in the world and made a reported £18.9bn in revenue, suggesting that fast fashion is not falling out of favour with consumers who want to find entire outfits on a budget.",Fast fashion retailer ASOS struggles to engage consumers as company losses balloon,https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/fashion/fashion-retailer-asos-struggles-to-engage-consumers-as-company-losses-balloon-b2439673.html,The Independent - Life and Style
entertainment,Ryan Gilliam,2023-12-19T18:16:57+00:00,"Art Cullagh is a sleepy man in the Last Light Inn of Baldur’s Gate 3’s second act, and he’s the key to breaking the Shadow Curse that plagues the Shadow-touched lands.

Once you make it into act 2 and reach the central hub of the Last Light Inn, you’ll be able to wake up Art, locate Thaniel, defeat Oliver, and finally recruit Halsin as a real companion for your party. All of that takes place during a lengthy quest that will take you all across these new lands and to the edge of Moonrise Towers.

In this Baldur’s Gate 3 guide, we’ll walk you through how to wake up Art Cullagh and how to break the Shadow Curse in act 2.

Wake up Art Cullagh

Once you reach the Last Light Inn in the Shadow-cursed Lands, head back to your camp and talk to Halsin. He’ll tell you the tale of a young man named Thaniel, a Tiefling who is the root of the curse that’s taking over the Shadow-cursed Land.

Now head back to the Last Light Inn and visit the bunks on the first floor, just to the right of the entrance. There’ll be a man named Art Cullagh lying in bed with a swirly animation above him. Talk to him and he’ll mutter something about Thaniel. Walk through the dialogue and you’ll learn that he needs some kind of personal item to wake him.

Return to Halsin in camp, and the Druid will decide he needs to see the sleeping man himself. Jump back to the Last Light Inn and talk to Art again, this time with Halsin’s help. Read Art’s last orders letter and a quest marker near Moonrise Towers will appear. Make your way there.

In the town, near the Road to Baldur’s Gate Waypoint, you’ll find the House of Healing and the cemetery it’s connected to — not exactly a good pairing if you want people to have faith in your hospital. Inside you’ll be directed to the operating theater and the “doctor” on staff.

Make your way into the large room at the back of the hospital and you’ll meet Malus Thorm and his crew of assistants. Thorm is an undead boss who is also a “surgeon” torturing a patient. Talk to him enough and you’ll end up in some combat. Kill Thorm and his cronies and then loot his body once combat is over. He’ll have a Battered Lute on his person. Take it and return to Art back in Last Light.

Locate and rescue Thaniel

With the Battered Lute in hand, walk up to Art and accept the prompt to play him a song. Don’t worry if you’re not proficient in an instrument, your character will just dopily pluck away at the strings until Art wakes up.

After Halsin talks to Art, he’ll decide that he needs to peer into another dimension to rescue Thaniel. Follow him to the shore and get ready for a fight. Let Halsin go into the portal on his own and prepare to defend it. A massive army of undead creatures will appear on the shore and start trying to reach the portal.

You’ll need to hold them off for multiple rounds of combat in order to progress the quest. We recommend Shadowheart here, as she’s able to use Turn Undead against all of the creatures. Gale is also an excellent choice, as his large AoE abilities like Fireball can take out many of the low health critters at once.

Once you’ve successfully defended the portal for the required time, all of the undead will burn up and Halsin will return from the portal carrying Thaniel’s body. The Druid will ask you to come back to camp and talk. Meet him there and he’ll finally offer to join your crew to finish rescuing Thaniel.

Finish Thaniel’s quest to lift the curse

Just because you have Halsin in your crew doesn’t mean you can relax, or that the Druid doesn’t have more work for you to do.

In order to remove the curse, you’ll need to find Thaniel’s other half: Oliver, an obnoxious boy who likes playing hide and seek in the middle of the cursed lands. You can find his little house to the east of Last Light in an area called “House in Deep Shadows” on the map.

When you find him, Oliver will ask to play hide-and-seek. Oblige him and look around until you perceive his location. He’ll get mad and try another game where he hides again and summons some wraiths to chase you.

Now you can either sneak around and carefully try to catch him again, or you can get caught and just kill the shades. Either way, talk to Oliver again and he won’t want to play with you, because he’s a jerk. Assuming you’ve already rescued Thaniel, you can tell Oliver that he needs to rejoin his other half. This will eventually lead to another minor combat encounter.

Oliver will teleport you to the Moonrise Towers town square, alongside resurrected versions of his Mommy and Daddy Shades. Oliver will encase himself in a shield and sic his undead minions on you. Each time you kill one of his enemies, Oliver’s shield will also take damage. You can also directly target the shield with attacks. Break the shield one way or the other to talk to Oliver again. Persuade or threaten him and he’ll decide to rejoin with Thaniel.

Head back to camp again and talk to the now-complete boy. Unfortunately, Thaniel alone won’t be able to end the curse on the lands. Instead you’ll need to finish the mainline quest in Moonrise Towers. But at least Thaniel is whole again — and, more importantly, you have a brand new Druid friend to keep you company on your adventures.",How to wake Art Cullagh and lift the Shadow Curse in Baldur’s Gate 3,https://www.polygon.com/baldurs-gate-3-guides/24006461/thaniel-art-cullagh-shadow-curse,Polygon
entertainment,Nicole Clark,2023-10-20T16:20:53+00:00,"Many games are huge. Others are endless. Some are so exciting that they swallow our news feeds whole. That’s where Polygon’s What to Play comes in: We curate the best, most innovative, and most intriguing games on every platform, so you can spend less time searching, and more time playing.

There’s a lot to love about the Nintendo Switch, not least of which is the abundance of titles with local multiplayer features, making it a great console for game night with friends or a casual play session with a roommate. We’ve collected some of our favorite titles that allow for good old-fashioned local play.

It’s also my preferred play style, as the last few years have given me more excuses to stay in and try new games. Local multiplayer makes ass-kicking games much more approachable, thanks to friends respawning my character. I also love building something together in real time, like a farm in Stardew Valley, or causing communal chaos like with Untitled Goose Game’s treacherous honking. Sure, couch co-op can also mean getting revived just to get ragdolled across spikes in Spelunky 2. But it sure beats dying alone.

And if you’re looking for more platform-agnostic couch co-op recommendations, here are our favorite local multiplayer games, games to play with a Valentine’s Day beau, and a Dear Polygon column about couch co-op. Our last update added Escape Academy.

For two players

This modern-classic farming sim game takes its cues from the Harvest Moon series, and running a farm with your friends only adds to the fun. You can work together to plant and harvest crops or spend your days doing different activities, like fishing or mining. Local co-op is available for two players — just don’t forget to build an extra cabin on your farm. (Up to four can play with online multiplayer.)

This Switch remaster includes both Portal and Portal 2, seminal games well worth the revisit. You’ll explore and solve puzzles by using a portal gun; experimenting within the game’s physics is even more fun with a friend in tow. (Plus, when playing local co-op, the number of portals that can be placed is doubled.)

Congrats, you are the new CEO of a large corporation, and your wisdom is required to help employees stay on task. Good Job! has a lot in common with Untitled Goose Game. In this isometric game, you’ll be given a list of tasks — like bringing a projector into the conference room. But no one said you couldn’t do it by launching it like a projectile through the window.

This Wii U game’s Switch port is full of charm. Play together in local co-op as Captain Toad and Toadette, and explore and solve your way through a series of bite-size puzzles. Each self-contained course has little nooks and crannies to pop in and out of, and Koopas to navigate around.

It’s a lovely morning in the village and you are a horrible goose! Cause mayhem and honk to your heart’s content in this charming game. With local co-op you and one friend can each be horrible geese, using teamwork to terrorize the townspeople. Honk honk HONK!!

In this melancholy game, you play as Stella the ferrymaster, who guides spirits into the afterlife. Meet wonderful characters and help them find closure. Spiritfarer combines exploration on the seas with management sim elements, as you build housing, kitchens, and more, and learn to farm, cook, and craft. Player two is Stella’s cat Daffodil, who can do most management sim tasks — she just can’t talk to characters, and thus, can’t trigger quests.

Screw playing as the plumber in the red hat — it’s time to be his taller counterpart. In Luigi’s Mansion 3, you can play local co-op with player two as Gooigi (a spooky goo Luigi) after finishing the intro walkthrough and getting E. Gadd’s briefcase. Platform your way through the haunted hotel to save your friends Mario, Peach, and numerous Toads.

This modern-day, punishingly difficult platformer has the beautiful look of vintage animation. The art direction and soundtrack are wholly unique, making the game a joyride from start to finish, despite the challenge. Mugman, Cuphead’s sibling, can join on a local co-op journey.

Play as a Yarny (a living ball of yarn that looks like a small sprite) and solve puzzles with a friend by using your spare yarn to pull, yank, and swing. It requires quite a bit of teamwork. Where other local co-op games might allow players to wander and do their own thing, this game is all about solving puzzles using each other’s momentum.

Kirby games tend to be perfectly chill and incredibly adorable, and this one is no exception. In Forgotten Land you and another player run, float, and fight through 3D levels. In addition to Kirby’s classic inhale powers, Forgotten Land also gifted us “mouthful mode,” which lets Kirby stretch like a glove over enormous objects like cars and huge lightbulbs. (By the way, Kirby Star Allies is also fun with local co-op.)

Play as characters named “Nobody” as you work together to attempt to cure the world of a poisonous blight, and figure out why you have no memory of your past life. But there’s another twist: Instead of a classic perk tree, your characters will unlock various forms — like a turtle, ghost, knight, or ninja — each with its own set of moves. What’s more, the forms can synergize with one another, making for some incredibly absurd skill combos.

Cat Quest 2

This criminally underrated action game puts you in the shoes of a cat fighting their way through the pun-filled land of Felingard. And player two gets to be a dog! Playing is a simple grind in this approachable and silly RPG. Fight your way through dungeons, meet necromancer cats, and try on lots of outfits.

Play as an automaton that needs a gem substance to survive, and fight against the clock to keep your friends from becoming “unsighted” and turning into shells of their former selves. This Metroidvania has an incredible map with three interwoven floors of levels, and tons of Zelda-like puzzles. A couch co-op buddy makes these challenges much more surmountable.

This pixel art Metroidvania has the feel of a great NES game, with its retro aesthetic and excellent platforming and battling. The definitive edition (which includes the original Shovel of Hope campaign), available on Nintendo Switch, supports local co-op for two players.

The Lego games are always a great laugh, and they have reliable couch co-op modes (see also: Lego Marvel Super Heroes 2). They’re accessible, family-friendly, and give a silly spin to some of the most recognizable films of our time. The Skywalker Saga is no different, with Lego versions of a whopping nine movies from the behemoth franchise and 200-plus minifigs to unlock.

A silly collaboration between Nintendo and Ubisoft became one of the sleeper hits of its release year. This squad tactics game pairs Mario and friends with their own doppelganger Rabbids against a veritable sea of evil Rabbids. While local co-op is limited to five specific challenges — so we wouldn’t recommend buying it specifically for co-op play alone — these levels are especially fun. Working together changes the tactical dynamics.

Crypt of the Necrodancer is the perfect combination of dungeon crawler and rhythm game — with some sweet tunes, to enliven the whole experience. But dancing through the game’s levels is even more fun with a friend, even if having someone else there doesn’t necessarily make it easier. You both still have to stay on beat!

If you’ve ever wanted an escape room experience but in a video game, Escape Academy absolutely scratches that itch. Up to two couch co-op players can go to this school for puzzle enthusiasts. Players find solutions and crack codes to avoid legitimately perilous fates — like a tower flooding with water as you climb. Hints (and red herrings) are everywhere. Are you smart enough to escape each room?

For two or more players

Super Mario Bros. has always been one of Nintendo’s most beloved franchises, and Wonder is another banger. Super Mario Bros. Wonder brings together so many delightful ideas: platforming shenanigans, silly power-ups, and lots of map secrets. The best part? Four people can play local multiplayer, picking from so many classic characters: Mario, Luigi, Princess Peach, Princess Daisy, Toad, Toadette, and more.

I’ve donated hours and hours of my life to this deceptively simple roguelike bullet-hell — min-maxing various buffs in order to avoid waves of mob attacks. But multiplayer changes everything. Having more reinforcements to fight waves of attacks means each player can try out unique combinations of weapons and buffs. Just make sure you and your teammates stay in the same screen; there isn’t split screen.

Though packing up and moving is a pain in the neck in real life, Moving Out 2 turns the experience into a goofy, whimsical group experience. Play as a member of the F.A.R.T. moving crew (yes, you read that correctly) attempting to move furniture, and other items, around some highly inconvenient spaces.

Now more than a decade old, Diablo 3 is still a great local multiplayer choice, especially on the Switch. The action RPG, which felt bombastic when it first came out, has become a very comforting grind game that I get to share with friends. (Especially as Diablo 4 hasn’t made its way to Nintendo Switch.)

This one is not for the faint of heart. Work with a friend to excavate cave levels, avoid the dangers within, and ration supplies. In local co-op, if one of you dies, you can bring them back to life by finding a coffin. Ragdoll physics — not to mention turkey riding — add challenge and humor to one of the best platformer roguelikes.

This edition of Rayman Legends has all of the platforming and hijinks that the series is known for. Play through delightful levels and time trials, and collect to your heart’s content. Having multiple players is particularly helpful for respawning, as the game ramps up in difficulty in its later levels.

Sure, racing games and soccer games are fun on their own — but mashing the two together results in something bizarre and unforgettable. Rocket League asks what other games don’t dare to: What if you played soccer? And what if you did that with rocket-powered vehicles?

Towerfall Ascension is the gold standard for 2D arena games. Players are archers and must fight each other with well-placed arrows, or by stomping from above. Movement is a dream with dodging and dashing in the air, lending each character a spry and agile feel. Different multiplayer variants, like starting with just one arrow and having to scavenge for others, keep rounds feeling fresh.

This bestseller is a no-brainer for anyone looking to spend time with friends in a sandbox world. Mine, build, dig, fish, plant crops, and protect yourself from the monsters that come out at night — and most of all, survive.

This definitive remaster bundles Overcooked and Overcooked 2 (both excellent games) into one delicious package. Prepare orders for hungry customers while facing ridiculous odds — like cooking in a hot air balloon with cooktops that sometimes catch on fire, or while crossing a busy street.

If you’re searching for that classic Super Mario feeling in a modern 3D world, look no further. (Or if you’ve always wanted to play as Mario in a cat suit.) Play as Mario, Luigi, Peach, or Toad — each of them has a slightly different perk. Luigi can get a bit more air in his jump, while Toad is a bit faster.

The Mario Party series reigns supreme as a family-friendly, chill party time. In this board game-style title, players pick their favorite Nintendo character and then roll the dice to land on a spot on the board. Players compete in minigames, including a baseball-bat-swinging rhythm game, rowboat race, snow catching, and so many more.

Wii Sports’ legacy will never be forgotten (nor will its banging soundtrack). Nintendo Switch Sports gracefully takes up the mantle of its predecessor, along with many of the same classic sports, like bowling, golf, and tennis. It also adds some new ones to the mix, like volleyball and chambara (a great complement to Wii Sports’ boxing). Just make sure you have enough space around you so you don’t accidentally hit your television.

No multiplayer Nintendo Switch list would be complete without mentioning the most recent edition of 20-year series Mario Kart. Though the game came out in 2017, it still reigns supreme, as far as kart racing goes — and it still gets new courses, like the recent addition of Mario Kart 7’s Rainbow Road.

Scramble with your friends to operate a spaceship hurtling through outer space. Each of you can only pilot one of the ship’s eight total control panels at any given time. We hope you like your partners, because you’ll be shouting directions and trying not to lose it as you work together.

entertainment,Petrana Radulovic,2023-12-12T16:01:00+00:00,"Walt Disney Animation’s newest movie, Wish, is the culmination of the studio’s celebration of its own centennial. That project stretched throughout 2023, through projects like the short Once Upon a Studio, specialized merchandise drops centered around each decade the company has been around, and the rebrand of the iconic Disney castle logo. But Wish leans so hard on celebrating the better Disney films that came before it that it doesn’t have much identity of its own. It’s openly a nostalgia-fest, pretty much on par with the other ways the company celebrated its 100-year anniversary.

In 2023, Disney drilled in harder than ever on looking admiringly at its own history. And why shouldn’t it? The company has a full century of beloved movies, characters, and storytelling to mine for big emotion. Even people who’ve outgrown Disney probably still have residual fondness for at least one of the animated movies they watched in their youth. But nostalgia-bait isn’t limited to Disney’s big birthday celebration: It’s basically what the company has been selling for decades now.

While living in and echoing its own past has been profitable for Disney, it isn’t sustainable. And ultimately, harping so hard on its own glory days is pretty antithetical to Disney’s legacy. In order to move forward, it needs to shed the nostalgia — or at least not make it the company’s primary selling point.

Nostalgia is safe

From a moneymaking standpoint, it’s easy to see why Disney sticks to legacy-linked projects: They’re all but guaranteed to make bank. Disney’s live-action remakes and sequels consistently get mixed to poor reviews, but they make hundreds of millions of dollars. People will pay to see their faves on screens again, or to try to share their happy childhood memories with their own children.

At least, they will until they get tired of the diminished returns. The live-action remakes might make a lot of money in the short run, but all they’re really doing is reiterating what Disney has done in the past, without meaningfully adding to the original movies’ legacy.

Remember the Disney sequel era? When Disney pumped out cheap direct-to-home-video titles based on every beloved Disney movie from The Fox and the Hound to The Lion King? Disney tries not to. After John Lasseter took over as Disney’s chief creative officer in 2006, he canned the whole DTV department a year later, reportedly denouncing the way cheaply made sequels diminished the Disney brand. Even though Disney loves to celebrate its past, the studio rarely references this era.

Even with a much higher budget and flashier visuals, the live-action remake fad Disney has been riding for the past decade is still contributing to the feeling of nostalgia oversaturation. And the studio’s many spinoffs and reboots don’t help, either. Some of these legacy projects have been good, but even so, the sheer volume of them just doesn’t seem built to last.

One of the most recent Disney live-action projects announced is a rendition of 2016’s animated hit Moana — a great movie that hasn’t even really had a chance to build its own legacy. The kids who watched it when it first came out are mostly still kids. But Disney is now assuming that anything it makes will have an instant legacy, without actually letting the nostalgia naturally brew on its own.

Disney’s brand management of Star Wars, Marvel, Fox, the Muppets, and a host of other properties only emphasizes this oversaturation. The Disney empire stretches far and wide these days, and characters like Baby Yoda and Tony Stark sit alongside Mickey Mouse and Cinderella in theme parks, on Disney Plus promotional material, and on Bob Iger’s X header. Disney plays up “Disney Magic” as part of its brand. But when every major franchise in America is lumped together as Disney magic, what’s left?

Innovation is Disney’s real legacy

Over the past 100 years, Disney has taken some big, risky swings, and has fumbled many, many times. From the dark and dreary Black Cauldron, which almost bankrupted the studio in 1985, to the off-kilter adventure movies of the early 2000s, the studio’s mold-breaking passion projects have often been megaflops. But at the same time, some of the company’s most memorable movies have stemmed from these risks.

The original 1940 Fantasia was one of Walt Disney’s most ambitious passion projects turned box-office failures, but the Sorcerer Mickey short is as iconic as the mouse himself. Lilo & Stitch was so damn weird that the filmmakers basically hid it from the rest of the company; it ended up making back more than three times its budget, and more importantly, turning Stitch into one of the studio’s most memorable characters. And even The Little Mermaid, the film that kickstarted the Disney Renaissance, was a risk; a big Broadway-style musical of its type just hadn’t been done in animation before.

After all, Walt Disney himself famously pushed for progress and innovation, especially in the studio’s creative endeavors, even when that translated into poor financial decisions. What’s made his studio so special over the past century is how it’s looked forward, trying new things even in the face of failure and taking chances that other production houses couldn’t afford or risk. The company’s biggest legacy isn’t the princesses, the theme parks, or even Mickey Mouse: It’s how all those elements started out as daring projects that no one else was doing.

And yet Disney and its fans apparently keep forgetting that, and keep clinging to the past with such ardor that it does their idol’s legacy a disservice.

There’s a time and place for the past

Nostalgia isn’t a bad thing, nor is it entirely at odds with Walt Disney. Even in his quest for innovation, Walt was a nostalgic guy who idealized “the good old days,” to the point where he modeled the entrances of his theme parks after how his hometown looked at the turn of the 20th century. I, certainly, am not immune to Disney nostalgia. I love Disney. I have multiple Disney-themed plushies. I teared up when I watched Once Upon a Studio. I launched an entire yearlong content package so I could celebrate Disney.

But nostalgia is a potent ingredient, and it works best in the Disney recipe for success when it’s on the side: in celebratory shorts, theme-park parades, and collectible merchandise. Not when it’s the main offering. For most of the past century, Walt Disney Studios was a movie studio first, and a storefront, streaming service, and theme-park empire second.

It feels like that balance has shifted over the last decade. And if Disney wants to last another century, and make things that actually spark new nostalgia down the line, it should go back to embracing fresh, different ideas.

Hardcore Disney fans aren’t always keen on new things. They cry out for a return to their favorites, the memory of watching a Disney movie for the first time. Maybe that means demanding animated Disney movies have proper villains again. Maybe it means asking for more musicals — or fewer of them. Maybe it’s lamenting the loss of traditional 2D animation. Maybe it’s specifically missing the animated musical sequences of the Disney Renaissance. There are even people who yearn for a return to the animal-focused movies of the 1970s. Whatever that Disney draw is, it’s different for every single person.

And because Disney fans have so many separate, individualized desires, it’s impossible for the company to focus on meeting every single one of them. Besides, more often than not, even though people cry out for the good old days, what they’re really missing is the feeling of discovering something new — that first viewing of a movie that will become a lasting favorite. Trying to check off all the items on a checklist that doesn’t even really describe what people want… that doesn’t make good movies. It barely makes tolerable ones.

With 100 years of creative life under its belt, Walt Disney Studios has a lot to be proud of. But Mickey Mouse didn’t become a staple overnight. Before Mickey was an icon, before the Disney Princess brand was even a thing, before Disney owned a million other entertainment companies, Disney filmmakers were trying daring things, while making a lot of costly mistakes along the way. But each of those mistakes was an opportunity, a legacy of its own that helped usher in the great movies the studio is known for.

That’s not a message that executives and shareholders want to hear. But you don’t get to a hundred-year legacy by playing it safe. You need to have faith and trust in storytelling, in the creative minds behind the great movies, in the power of progress. And a little pixie dust doesn’t hurt, either.","Dear Disney: If you want to last another century, lay off the legacy",https://www.polygon.com/23997574/disney-100-years-movies-wish-legacy-walt-live-action-nostalgia,Polygon

Share All sharing options for: Twitch is the best way to watch sports, when you can actually watch sports on Twitch

Need a new way to watch sports? Twitch might be exactly what you’ve been looking for.

It’s no secret that fans have historically consumed sports through live events and cable TV, but as media consumption has shifted, many — especially in younger generations — have sought out sports content on social platforms.

Twitch in particular has become a platform where sports streamers and fans have flocked. During the COVID-19 shutdowns in 2020, athletes and sports leagues around the world joined the platform to stream video games when live sports were temporarily on hiatus — and years later, some of them are still active. WNBA player Aerial Powers regularly streams herself playing games like NBA 2K and Apex Legends, while Argentinian former soccer player Sergio Agüero uses his channel to livestream Kings League and Queens League games. Organizations like the NBA, the NFL, and the UFC have their own Twitch channels where they promote and share content. For instance, the UFC runs watch-along streams hosted by former mixed martial artist, boxer, and kickboxer Jens Pulver.

Polygon is celebrating TwitchCon 2023 with a package of stories covering streaming trends and news from the show. Check it out!

In recent years, Twitch has introduced a TwitchSports channel as well as a stand-alone sports category to help users find live sporting events and sports-related content. On the stand-alone sports category page — which, as of publication, has 2.7 million followers — users can find creators commentating and analyzing various sports, reaction and watch-along streams, some live sports feeds, and streams of creators playing sports video games. Take a look and you’ll see everything from motorsports and soccer to tennis, volleyball, and even pickleball.

EnterpriseAppsToday reported that in 2023, Twitch’s “Sports” category registered around 8 million hours of watch time. YPulse survey research from April found that 66% of Gen Zers are tuning into platforms like Twitch to follow their favorite sports. “In contrast to the more spectator-oriented sports watching of earlier generations, Gen Z has evolved the experience into an interactive digital experience through social and streaming platforms,” says Anastasia Pelot, YPulse’s content marketing manager.

While livestreams of major league games are less common to find on Twitch due to broadcast rights, some leagues — nationally and globally — have experimented with streaming games in recent years. The NBA signed a deal with Twitch in 2017 to stream minor league games while giving fans the chance to interact with each other. The two also teamed up in 2019 for a separate deal to exclusively stream USA Basketball games globally. When Amazon began airing Thursday Night Football games last fall, Nielsen reported a total viewership figure of 13 million for its first exclusive game, which included U.S. Prime Video subscribers who streamed on Twitch.

Twitch creator EsfandTV, who requested to go by Esfand for this story, is a streamer with 1.2 million followers who follow not only for gaming content, but for his sports streaming as well. He says that broadcast rights are one of the aspects hindering Twitch from becoming a full-blown sports streaming platform. Leagues still own the rights when it comes to where sports are aired, and Esfand says they need to adapt if they want to reach young and international sports fans.

“The NBA is king,” Esfand says. “When it comes to hockey, the NHL is king. But what’s happening is these different leagues, they are the boss. They’re the governing body. They have all the rights to everything and when it comes to content, they can be in control.”

Esfand says if done properly, a league can partner with a streamer that has a large audience and find a way to allow rights to reduce the barrier to entry for users. “You can’t just block it out in certain markets,” Esfand says. “When I did a stream [of a football game], I think Canada couldn’t watch. Most of Europe couldn’t watch.”

Some leagues have partnered with streamers and have yielded successful results: LiveMode and FIFA partnered with Brazilian streamer Casimito to broadcast the 2022 World Cup on Twitch in Latin America, while the Men in Blazers podcast hosted its popular live watch-along shows for some World Cup matches in the U.S. Earlier this year, Casimito also struck a deal to stream the 2023 Women’s World Cup on his channel. The NBA also signed a deal in 2021 with Alexandre “Gaules” Borba Chiqueta and Budweiser to stream games in Brazilian markets.

“These are the things that, if they’re done the right way, you are now attracting the younger audience who is not watching cable TV as much anymore,” Esfand says.

In place of regularly streaming games, Esfand has found other ways to engage with fans on his channel. Esfand’s Tailgate Tour, where he visits college towns and showcases college football culture — everything from the tailgating atmosphere to the energy inside the stadium — resonates strongly with young and global fans, especially those who might not be familiar with American college traditions.

In April, he livestreamed Esfand’s Draft Night Extravaganza on Twitch. The broadcast coincided with the first day of the NFL draft and featured a mix of Twitch creators like Will Neff and Erobb221 as well as current and former NFL players including Austin Ekeler, Micah Parsons, and Kenny Vaccaro, where they provided analysis and commentary on draft picks.

“I have people that have been watching me for years playing World of Warcraft or doing something that isn’t football, but they’re actually huge football fans”

In some cases, fans preferred Esfand’s show to the traditional broadcast. “I havent watched or cared about football in like 10 years but i still watched this whole stream and loved it,” one viewer commented on YouTube, where the Twitch stream was uploaded after airing.

Another user wrote, “I love all things football and I pretty much had the draft on TV muted while watching your stream.”

Esfand says he feels fortunate he’s been able to stream more sports content on his channel over the last few years, to the point where people have recognized him solely for his football content. He adds that it’s been interesting seeing fans evolve from those that were fans of his gaming streams to ones who are sports fans, or discovering gaming fans who are also sports fans.

“I have people that have been watching me for years playing World of Warcraft or doing something that isn’t football, but they’re actually huge football fans,” Esfand says. “A big part of Twitch is that people like watching streamers they can relate to. Because what happens is, it’s not just about the streamer; it’s also about the streamer’s chat. Now they are getting involved in the community, whether it’s just through chat itself or through Discord.”

Alex Casassovici, founder and CEO of Azarus, a company that works with online creators to enhance the streaming experience, says that livestreaming sports and sports-related content on platforms like Twitch creates a more intimate experience for streamers and fans alike.

“I think what we’re looking at is either a very curated kind of managed channel, and more grassroots-like, creator-led experiences,” Casassovici says. “That’s clearly something that can be differentiated when it comes to streaming.”

Twitch seems to see value when it comes to investing in sports streamers. A few years ago, the platform launched the Sports Accelerator Program to support sports content creators wanting to get into “sports talk,” like podcasts, talk shows, reaction streams, sidecasts, watch-alongs, and more, through live workshops and by providing opportunities to network and expand their viewership.

U.K.-based Keira Megan, who goes by keirameganxx on Twitch and was previously part of the Sports Accelerator Program, has been on the platform for about a year and a half with a focus on soccer and motorsports like Formula 1. While Formula 1 has always been primarily popular in Europe, it’s seen growth among new fans in the United States in recent years, thanks in part to docuseries like Netflix’s Drive to Survive.

While she doesn’t stream actual races or games due to broadcast rights, Megan hosts watch-along streams for fans who want to hear her commentary. Megan says that while she doesn’t have as many followers on Twitch as she does on her YouTube channel, there are elements of Twitch she prefers to YouTube, including the ability to be herself and engage with fans more closely.

“People want to know what you want to say,” Megan says. “They come into my Twitch channel and ask me about the race. They asked me three days later about a [soccer] match. They want to talk about it. I think Twitch is good for that. I think it’s good for one-on-one. I find that Twitch is where I’m the most engaged with my audiences, and they feel closest to me.”","Twitch is the best way to watch sports, when you can actually watch sports on Twitch",https://www.polygon.com/23923506/sports-streamers-twitch-ufc-nba-nfl-broadcast-rights-streaming,Polygon
entertainment,Zach Rabiroff,2023-11-09T17:12:20+00:00,"Vampire fiction has a long and distinguished pedigree in English. From the moment that Robert Southey introduced the British Isles to the concept of the coffin-sleeping undead at the turn of the 19th century, the authors of vampiric stories have mirrored the changing face of the society that reads them.

We're spending a week diving deep into the stories behind your favorite vampires. Who says we only get to celebrate vampires at Halloween?

And yet, scholars have largely turned a blind eye to one lingering question: Which of these authors were, themselves, nosferatu? Was night-stalking Lord Byron secretly a daywalker? Could it be that Anne Rice’s innate understanding of deathless sexiness is itself a result of her fellowship in the camp of the undead?

Until we understand which writers have been secretly propagandizing for Dracular overlords, our understanding of the place of vampires in anglophone culture will never be fully complete. So in the interest of bettering the cause of human understanding and avoidance of unwilling resurrection, we present the following field guide to secretly vampiric authors, past and present.

John William Polidori

Best-known vampire book: The Vampyre (1819)

While the concept of vampires goes back at least as far as Balkan folktales from the middle ages or earlier, its history in the English-speaking world began in earnest with Dr. John William Polidori’s novel The Vampyre at the turn of the 19th century. The book itself has as high-class an origin as any bloodsucker book could ask for, having been born at a Swiss chalet, in the same spooky story contest where Mary Shelley hatched the idea for Frankenstein. The contest entry for another participant, Lord Byron, was the tale of an aristocratic Englishman who is secretly an ancient, unkillable force of evil. Being too lazy to actually write the story himself, Byron passed along the idea to his personal physician and party guest, Polidori, who spun it out into his novel three years later.

Polidori had always had an adorably puppy dog-ish devotion to Byron — that mercurial, temperamental, but undeniably sexy man of the late-night hours. So it’s not surprising to see the doctor’s depiction of the book’s vampiric main character, Lord Ruthven, take on a certain erotic charge. Ruthven is described as cruelly sadistic, mockingly contemptuous of others, yet desperately desired by those around him for reasons even they can’t entirely explain.

He is, in other words, a pathetically obvious stand-in for Byron himself, and Polidori’s almost unwilling attraction to his questionable friend marks him out as a classic human thrall of an undead overlord.

Verdict: Not a vampire, but Byron… vampire all the way

Bram Stoker

Best-known vampire book: Dracula (1897)

The real breakthrough moment for vampires in the English-speaking world came just before the turn of the 20th century with the publication of Bram Stoker’s appropriately immortal novel Dracula. Stoker’s story of a Transylvanian count who takes residence in the U.K. in order to launch a centuries-old plan of vampiric conquest and enslavement became the source of pastiches, spinoffs, and cliches almost from the moment it arrived. As a result, its influence codified many of the basic elements of vampire storytelling for the next half-century or more: the foreign, undead aristocrat whose cosmopolitan charm and suave allure stood in for English fears and paranoias about the allure of other nations and races; the bloodsucking conversion process (targeted, invariably, against either women or the more effeminate among the male set) that reads alarmingly like seduction; the tricks and traps of the vampire hunters that range from wooden stakes to garlic to sunlight to good old simple beheadings.

Stoker’s own biography is almost the inverse of his noble-born immortal count, but it’s still fittingly enigmatic for the writer of the seminal work of undead fiction. Born to a middle-class Protestant Irish family in the 1840s, Stoker’s life grew progressively more bizarre: Among other things, he took a keen interest in the occult studies of the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn, as well as the history and practices of the Freemasons. Cultivating a public reputation? Seeking inspiration for a never-materialized new hit story? Perhaps. Then again, it’s just possible that somewhere along the way, Stoker had acquired a membership to the most elite secret society of all.

Verdict: Vampire

Stephen King

Best-known vampire book: ’Salem’s Lot (1975)

’Salem’s Lot, Stephen King’s second published book after the breakout success of 1974’s Carrie, concerns (obviously) a writer who returns to his childhood hometown in (obviously) rural Maine, only to discover gradually but gruesomely that the entire society is in thrall to the undead.

If the vampire stories of the Victorian era had used their monstrous antagonists as allegories for the deepest fears of the fading 19th century, King’s novel was an encapsulation of post-Watergate suspicions that government corruption had infected all levels of the community. But just as notable as King’s modernizing of the vampire novel is his decided and inarguable resemblance to creature of the night himself.

In addition to famously dwelling in the least accessible reaches of rural New England, and maintaining a schedule, lifestyle, and an ability to defy death that would make Rasputin blush (dude survived a direct hit from a car, just for starters), King has also been frozen in an ageless state that could fairly be described as “non-specifically ancient” throughout his career. He’s not only a vampire, but it could be reasonably argued that he’s not even trying very hard to hide it. Still, given King’s recent and high-profile stances against corporate power and in favor of trans rights, it has to be admitted that he makes a strong case for vampire kind.

Verdict: Vampire (complimentary)

Anne Rice

Best-known vampire books: The Vampire Chronicles series (1976-2018)

Ever since the Victorian era, vampires in fiction have stood in for all the sexual urges, temptations, and repressed fears burbling below the surface of a repressive society. But until the late 20th century, subtext is where those messages stayed buried: charged little winks to audiences that may have led to genre success, but could never actually be stated out loud by any character on the page.

It would take until the 1970s for those themes to finally take center stage. Not coincidentally, it would take a woman to do it. When Anne Rice’s Interview with the Vampire reached bookshelves in 1976, it was a watershed moment for vampire novels — the first time a mainstream book had prominently featured vampires that were gay, campy, and unapologetically fabulous.

For that alone, you might mistake Rice for a classic vampire-infected propagandist for the cause, but the case is a little muddier than that. Rice had a famously ambivalent relationship with the Catholicism of her youth, first turning away from it in favor of sexy gothic monster books, then embracing it in the early 2000s to pen a series of Christ-themed religious fiction, then finally rejecting the Church once more over its conservative social positions (“It’s simply impossible for me to ‘belong’ to this quarrelsome, hostile, disputatious, and deservedly infamous group,” she wrote on her Facebook page at the time). Even so, religious flirtation is canonically one of the few things a vampire can’t tolerate even in small doses, so this is one case in which the jury is no longer out.

Verdict: Not a vampire

Laurell K. Hamilton

Best-known vampire books: Anita Blake: Vampire Hunter series (1993-present)

Laurell K. Hamilton’s vampire novels are like the final evolution of an undead Pokémon. Where Anne Rice made vampires sexy but still took pains to remind readers that they were fundamentally the stuff of nightmares, Hamilton’s Anita Blake series is more like the merrily obscene aesthetic of a 1970s grindhouse flick. Her characters bash, slaughter, and jump one another’s bones (animated or otherwise), but it’s all in good fun. With her books, the sexy and violent vampire has reached a Looney Tunes stage of madcap romp, and audiences can’t get enough of it.

But does that make Hamilton herself a vampire? I’d argue to the contrary. Nothing serves the vampire cause less than undermining the air of looming menace that they’ve been cultivating since the 15th century. Vlad the Impaler worked for that nickname, dammit, and the last thing they need is for an airport novel to make a stake through the heart look fun. No, Laurell K. Hamilton isn’t among the denizens of the undead. She’s the one thing they’ve come to fear this millennium: a good punchline.

Verdict: Not a vampire

Taika Waititi

Best-known vampire work: What We Do in the Shadows (2014, 2019-present)

While What We Do in the Shadows isn’t actually a work of prose fiction, and Waititi isn’t actually an author, who is to say what constitutes true literature, anyway? Regardless, What We Do in the Shadows, which Waititi co-created along with his fellow New Zealander Jemaine Clement (the two wrote and directed the original 2014 movie) is surely the most culturally pervasive piece of vampire-themed fiction to reach mass audiences over the past few years. Just as importantly, it marks the necessary next step in the inexorable movement of vampiric lore from creeping terror to sexy camp to outright comedy with only the faintest twist of terror to remind us of its origins. Two centuries after its English-language birth, the vampire genre has at last been metaphorically defanged. We humans have taken its blood and sucked it dry for our amusement.

And what can we say about Taika Waititi? Here is a director and writer who started out charmingly likable, beloved by both audiences and critics; he was happily invited into our homes; rapidly wore out his welcome; and, almost before we knew what had happened, he has curdled into an odorous pestilence we couldn’t seem to be rid of (when you lose the Chris Hemsworth demographic, you know you’re in trouble). And yet, here we are, coming back for more, year after year, drawn to him by a force we are powerless to explain — when it comes to Our Flag Means Death, we are all Renfields. And what, after all, could serve the vampire cause better than to trick us into thinking the threat had passed? My friends, we haven’t just found a vampire. We have found their king.

You know what’s cooler than a vampire story? A story that’s not a vampire story, but surprise — it has vampires.

The surprise vampire is a rich tradition, unfolding across many different media intended for all kinds of audiences. Sometimes it is a prominent part of a story that’s made richer for the unexpected presence of a bloodsucker.

Sometimes it is subtle, an easily missable detail that rewards only the most observant. In the best version, the vampires are always there, in the background, waiting for you to discover them — just like in real life.

Here are some of our favorite examples.

Baldur’s Gate 3: Astarion

If Baldur’s Gate 3 was your introduction to the Forgotten Realms of Dungeons & Dragons, you might be shocked to find out about a lot of stuff that’s tucked away in the world’s most famous tabletop role-playing game. The great thing about Baldur’s Gate 3 is how it centers all that weird stuff — like Astarion, a haughty elf that you can either play as or recruit to your party very early on, and guess what? He’s a vampire! And dealing with his vampirism is a huge part of the game, should that be something you want to do.

The Matrix Reloaded: The Merovingian’s Henchmen

Like a lot of ideas in the Matrix movies, a seemingly throwaway line leads to a blink-and-you’ll-miss-it scene with wild implications for everything you’re looking at. In The Matrix, The Oracle tells Neo that things that go bump in the night are in fact real, the result of a program misbehaving, an error in the virtual world of The Matrix. In The Matrix Reloaded, we meet some of those misbehaving programs in the form of the Merovingian’s henchmen. The Merovingian’s wife, Persephone, notes that they are very hard to kill — before she kills one of them with silver bullets. While the twin ghosts get significantly more screen time in Reloaded, the world of the films gets much more interesting when you realize that they are just two members of a whole assortment of ghoulies, and a superhuman kung fu god isn’t the only cool thing a character can be in these movies.

The Elder Scrolls: Everywhere

The fantasy of the Elder Scrolls games often presents as very straightforward. With the exception of Morrowind, each of the games starts out as a pretty up-the-middle fantasy setting, with nary a twist of any kind. But a big reason Elder Scrolls games have an enduring fan base is down to the fact that beneath the surface, there is always weird shit to find. Like vampires! And in keeping with the open-ended role-playing philosophy the series espouses, you can also become a vampire — it kicks ass.

Preacher: Cassidy

Preacher, the comic book by Garth Ennis and Steve Dillon — and its subsequent TV adaptation from Sam Catlin, Evan Goldberg, and Seth Rogen — starts with the basic assumption that God is real, and has walked out on the job. A lot of things are fair game at that point, namely angels, demons, and the like, but it’s still a shock when you meet Cassidy. A brawling, hard-drinking Irishman that’s already a load of fun when you meet him, Cassidy shoots up the power rankings when he sinks his teeth into a poor sap, because he’s a vampire.

Spider-Man: The Animated Series: Morbius

Hands down the ballsiest Spidey villain to adapt in a cartoon for children that censors wouldn’t even let use the words “sinister” or “kill,” Morbius — the Living Vampire — frankly had no business being in a Saturday morning lineup. The clever folks behind Spider-Man got around the strict content standards of their network with a loophole that might be even creepier than how vampires normally feed: by giving him little suckers on the palms of his hands that drain victims of “plasma.”

Hilariously, a creative application of vampirism would be how the show would later adapt another villain normally too violent for kids TV: Carnage, a serial killing symbiote who now “drained” his victims’ “life force” instead of cutting them to bits.

Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse: Miguel O’Hara

Miguel O’Hara, the Spider-Man of 2099, is one of Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse’s big enigmas. Comics readers will know plenty about his whole deal, but the movie doesn’t really explain much — except for a brief scene where he’s shown to have fangs, and an offhand reference that he is kind of a vampire? Sure, he’s a jerk, but he’s still kind of cool. It’s kind of hard not to be cool when you’re a vampire. That’s kind of the whole quandary with vampires as a metaphor.

Adventure Time: Marceline the Vampire Queen

For 11 episodes, Adventure Time was a show with lots of weird shit, but no vampires. Then “Evicted!” introduced Marceline the Vampire Queen, and the show changed forever. Marceline was key to what the show would go on to do so well: use its goofy sensibilities to tackle existentially dark and frightening things quite seriously without losing its edge, and play with familiar tropes to create a fantasy like no other. Now with vampires!

Sesame Street: The Count

I don’t really know why there’s a vampire on Sesame Street. I love him, though.

Metal Gear Solid 2: Vamp

The Metal Gear Solid games are kings of the nonchalant narrative curveball. It’s a series that takes great care to ground itself in near-future militaristic realism and hard sci-fi, only to suddenly introduce a man made of bees and a cyborg ninja. Vamp is one of those curveballs, the member of a rogue special forces unit with a superhuman resistance to injury, the ability to run on water, and a taste for blood — with an eerie origin story for that hunger, to boot.

The Bone Clocks: The Anchorites

David Mitchell loves to write books that start as one thing then end up as another. But he writes them knowing that people know he’s famous for this, so he often turns these books into other things still. It’s a real trip. The Bone Clocks, then, is a book about a psychic girl who gets into a bit of a pickle, only to learn about vampiric ghosts called Anchorites, who achieve immortality by murdering others. Don’t worry, I didn’t spoil the book for you.

The call of the couch gets stronger every year as new gadgets, movies, TV shows, and streaming services launch. As such, you may find yourself considering how to curate a space to watch coveted new (and old) releases that doesn’t involve leaving the house, or paying for tickets and reserved seating. You’ll still have to spend money on snacks, but not nearly as much.

A high-quality home cinema setup summons the most compelling parts of the silver screen into your own living room. Whatever it is you want to watch, upgrading your home theater hardware and related accessories can enhance your viewing experience.

LG C3 OLED TV

A TV is the beating heart of the home theater experience, and the LG C3 is a compelling sell for cinephiles who want the best possible video quality. The C2’s 65-inch OLED screen provides unparalleled contrast, and it has a 120 Hz refresh rate, which is great for making the most of gaming at a high frame rate via the PlayStation 5 or Xbox Series X. Like other high-end TVs, the C3 features Filmmaker Mode, which adjusts the picture and motion settings to display your favorite flicks as their director intended them to be seen.

LG Sound Bar C (SC9)

Finding the right soundbar to pair with your fancy TV can be a bit of a challenge. First, you need to decide what kind of features you want, then land on one that has a design that you like. Well, if you opted for the LG C3 OLED, you might as well get the soundbar that LG made to be the perfect companion in both regards. The SC9 soundbar and wireless subwoofer bolster the C3’s phenomenal picture quality with amazing audio, including Dolby Atmos support. When purchased through LG’s website, you’ll get a mounting bracket to fasten the soundbar to your wall — perfect if you’ve mounted your television, too.

Disney Bundle Trio

The chances are good that you’ve already found yourself aboard the streaming service carousel, juggling options such as Paramount Plus, Netflix, Max, and maybe more. If you want to slim down without losing out on great content, you can’t do much better than the Disney Bundle Trio. Disney Plus’ impressive catalog includes plenty of original content (and a bucketload of Marvel and Star Wars), but this deal gives you all that along with Hulu and ESPN, providing hours of sitcoms and sports.

Crunchyroll

Crunchyroll is the best streaming service for anime lovers or newcomers, with classics like JoJo’s Bizarre Adventure appearing alongside modern behemoths such as Jujutsu Kaisen, Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba, and Spy x Family. You’ll not only have access to an impressive catalog of quality anime with Crunchyroll — you’ll also be privy to premieres shortly after their debut in Japan, such as the highly anticipated Attack on Titan finale.

Crunchyroll Premium gift card $80 Prices taken at time of publishing. Give the gift of action, romance, and just about every other kind of anime genre for a year $80 at Crunchyroll

Chromecast with Google TV (4K)

Smart TVs tend to come with a range of downloadable apps built in, but performance is often middling at best — even in high-end models. If you’re looking for a compact and easy-to-use streaming device, it won’t cost you much. The latest Chromecast is a great choice that provides 4K HDR playback and comes with a voice-enabled remote, which can help you get to your favorite movies and shows faster than fiddling with on-screen keyboards.

Vudu gift cards for watching movies at home

Vudu is like a digital Blockbuster, a storefront with a huge catalog of films that you can rent or buy, ranging from new releases like Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem to beloved classics like The Nightmare Before Christmas. Unlike some other gift cards on the market, Vudu’s don’t expire, so you can take your time and save them for a rainy day. They also double as compelling gifts for the cinephile in your life.

Panasonic DP-UB420

Streaming has become the de facto way to watch your favorite movies, but sometimes you want the reliability and quality of a physical disc. And what better way to enjoy them than with a dedicated 4K Blu-ray player? There is no better way, dear reader. The Panasonic DP-UB420 is a model that won’t break the bank, yet it can handle everything from CDs and DVDs to 3D Blu-ray and 4K Blu-ray Discs, so it should cover your entire physical media collection.

One of the DP-UB420-K’s most compelling features is its HDR Optimizer, which, once set up, tweaks your content to look its best on your TV, no matter if it’s a high-end OLED screen or a run-of-the-mill LCD panel.

Roku Streambar Pro

If you’re in the market for both a streaming device and a soundbar, there’s precisely one product we can recommend that can do both: the Roku Streambar Pro. By plugging it into your TV’s HDMI port, you’ll get great sound quality that defies its petite size, and its streaming capabilities are up there with the best of them, providing 4K HDR so all of your movies and TV shows will look their best. The setup also comes with a universal remote that features voice controls.

Vizio 5.1.2 soundbar with Dolby Atmos

One of the highlights of going to the cinema is the booming surround sound that envelops the theater. The Vizio M512a-H6, a 5.1.2-channel soundbar setup, attempts to replicate that feeling (and succeeds) at a much smaller scale in your home with a highly configurable package. While the soundbar unit looks like most others out there, it comes with built-in speakers that are aimed upward to bounce sound off your ceiling, simulating the effect you get in theaters. This, plus its two included satellite speakers, allows Dolby Atmos-ready content to sing. Plus, these speakers look great, with a sleek, low-profile design.

CouchConsole

Crumb-covered seats and missing controllers can cause frustration when you want to relax, which is why we recommend the CouchConsole, an organizational caddy to keep around your sofa. This snack- (and controller)-protecting companion has a modular design that can be tweaked to fit your needs, and it includes a convenient self-balancing cup holder to avoid dreaded beverage spills when you get a bit too excited.

The CouchConsole also features a charging port, so phones, remotes, and controllers can stay juiced regardless of the marathon movie session you plan on undertaking with your friends.

Netgear Powerline 2000

There is nothing more infuriating than slow download speeds on your console, or getting hit with a severely pixelated image during the emotional climax of a film. If you primarily use Wi-Fi for your home theater devices, I might be describing your everyday reality, but it doesn’t have to be like this.

The Netgear Powerline helps to mitigate these issues by creating a power plug-based tether between your router and your devices. Each Powerline adapter features an ethernet port, letting you use your home’s electrical lines as an internet pathway. Clever! Just plug one in near your router and connect an ethernet cable, then use another adapter near the device that you want to hard-wire.

Govee Envisual TV backlight kit

If you want to add drama and atmosphere to your nightly viewings, consider the Govee Envisual TV backlight kit, which uses a mountable camera to track what’s on your screen to then project a matching light show behind the TV — almost as if the colors were bleeding off the screen.

Once you’ve got it set up by attaching the camera to either the top or bottom of your TV, you can manage the LED lights with the Govee Home app, or trigger them via voice commands, thanks to Alexa and Google Assistant support.",The best gifts to level up a home theater,https://www.polygon.com/deals/23989013/best-gifts-entertainment-center-tv-audio-blu-ray-streaming,Polygon
entertainment,Kayti Burt,2023-11-07T17:01:00+00:00,"Concert tickets are more expensive than ever. Inflation, Ticketmaster’s monopolistic practices, and increased demand after COVID-related touring delays have coincided to create a perfect storm of ticket-buying agony. Tours were never accessible to everyone: Geography, economics, health and safety concerns, and physical or mental ability make stadium and arena concerts — held only in major metropolitan areas, and only in certain countries — infeasible and/or unaffordable for large swaths of global pop music fandom. As fandom’s role as a source of identity and community becomes more precious, and more people than ever want to see certain concerts, the barriers to attending live shows are rising — so it’s no wonder that concert films are finding expansive new footing.

Take Taylor Swift: The Eras Tour, an almost three-hour filmed version of the pop star’s ongoing concert tour. The movie is now the highest-grossing concert film of all time. That isn’t just because of Taylor Swift’s expansive fandom — it’s a direct response to the difficulty of getting tickets to her shows. For fans, The Eras Tour offered up-close, intimate access to a show they never would have been able to attend otherwise.

In July, Pitchfork reported that the average cost of a ticket for the North American leg of Swift’s Eras Tour was $3,801 — a 2,321% increase from her 2018 Reputation Stadium Tour, where the average resale price for North American shows was $157. Taylor Swift: The Eras Tour tickets are $19.89 for adults. And people buying those tickets don’t even have to wait in the Ticketmaster queue of terror.

In February, one of the other biggest musical artists in the world, K-pop septet BTS, released a filmed version of their “Yet to Come” concert, which had been a one-night-only performance for 50,000 lucky fans in Busan, South Korea. The concert film made more than $50 million worldwide, even though the show had previously been streamed via Korean platform Weverse, allowing a reported 49 million fans to watch at home.

Seeing a concert film in a movie theater isn’t the same as attending a live concert, but it isn’t an inherently lesser experience, either. At least, it isn’t for me, and I attended the Yet to Come concert both in person and in cinemas.

The concert film experience has value past its re-creation of a specific intersection of place, time, and performance. I went to theaters to relive the once-in-a-lifetime experience of seeing the show live, but the film version was also its own unique collective fan experience. While I don’t think I need to expound on the glories of in-person shows — concerts are awesome, and BTS is very good at them — some aspects of the filmed version gave me new insight into my own live experience.

It also let me revisit it without any of the anxiety that often comes with a stadium concert experience. The logistics of getting 50,000 people into a 20-year-old stadium for the Yet to Come show weren’t simple. By the time the members of BTS took the stage in Busan, most of us had been in line for hours with limited access to bathrooms, water, or information about what was going on.

Once the concert started, conditions in the 3,000-strong standing areas got intense, as fans pushed toward the stage, crowding people at the front and prompting BTS to alter plans to come down into the audience for their performance of their 2018 hit “IDOL.” This wasn’t my first chaotic, stressful in-person stadium concert experience, and I doubt it will be my last. I’m able and willing to make this trade for the chance to see my favorite musical group perform, but not everyone is, even if they could get tickets.

Watching the movie version of Yet to Come, I was able to show up at the theater just 20 minutes before showtime. My BTS fan friends and I were all able to go together this time. And we watched the film in a theater full of fellow fans, BTS lightsticks in hand and BT21 Tata headband on head, giving us the same sense of fandom camaraderie as the in-person concert.

I missed some of the freedom of the in-person concert experience, like being able to choose where to direct my attention across the expansive stage, bedecked with intricate sets calling back to different eras in BTS history. But the clarity and focus of the detail in the concert film helped even the score. At the film, I got a much closer view of the choreography and the BTS members’ interaction, with a close-up camera intimacy I hadn’t gotten in person. I was sharing those fandom moments not only with the other people in my cinema, but with the millions of other fans viewing the same concert film around the world. Yet to Come will stream on Amazon Prime Video starting Nov. 9, further expanding the number of fans who will be able to see it.

Fans usually assume the live experience is superior to the filmed version, but in a time when in-person community is harder to come by than ever and can sometimes mean pushing people’s financial and/or physical limits, a filmed concert can feel like a gift. BTS, Taylor Swift, and Beyoncé — whose concert film Renaissance: A Film by Beyoncé hits theaters in December — all have massive fandoms. But we’re geographically scattered, and often stigmatized by a mainstream culture that belittles female-driven fan culture. I go to a BTS concert to see BTS perform, but also to be among other BTS fans, who already understand why I care so much about a Korean boy band. We trade freebies and photocards, help each other set up our lightsticks, and share our favorite songs or members. Whether in a stadium in Korea or a cinema at my local mall, I go to these events to feel that sense of belonging.

Attending a concert in person is sometimes used as a way to enforce a kind of fandom hierarchy, as if attending a concert in person makes you a bigger fan. It doesn’t. Fans who are able to attend the stadium and arena concerts for the biggest musical artists in the world aren’t necessarily more passionate. They just have a combination of luck and privilege that others lack. But concert films are leveling the field, dropping some of the barriers of price, location, and accessibility. They may not be the future of pop music for everyone, but they are increasingly looking like the future of pop music fandom. And that’s a good thing. Pop music fandom is a way for us to find collective joy and connection in art, and I want anyone who wants in to be able to join the party.",Concert movies are the future of pop music fandom,https://www.polygon.com/23945686/concert-movies-fandom-taylor-swift-bts-beyonce,Polygon

The main draw is acquiring the Jack-o’-Head Halloween armor, which can be sourced from collecting Pumpkin Tickets, a currency specific to the event.

As well as this, the weekend introduces a pumpkin rock Kulu-Ya-Ku and the chance to add a Halloween medal for your collection.

Here’s everything we know about Monster Hunter Now’s Halloween event — from how to get Pumpkin Tickets to dates, times, and other event bonuses.

Monster Hunter Now Halloween event dates, times, and bonuses

Monster Hunter Now’s Halloween event takes place between Wednesday, Oct. 25, at 9 a.m. to Tuesday, Oct. 31, at 11.59 p.m. local time, and has two phases:

In summary — you can begin earning Pumpkin Tickets at any time through the questline, but it isn’t until Saturday morning where you can encounter pumpkin rock Kulu-Ya-Ku and earn the Halloween medal.

As well as the above quests, monsters, and currencies, the game’s various arenas also see a Halloween makeover — with the world map, encounter screen, and battle arena becoming adorned with pumpkins.

How to get Pumpkin Tickets in Monster Hunter Now

Collecting Pumpkin Tickets is how you source the event-exclusive Jack-o’-Head armor piece. You can get Pumpkin Tickets in Monster Hunter Now by:

Both of the above sources are available to players who have reached Hunter Rank 11 and above.

Monster Hunter Now Halloween Pumpkin Hunt quest steps

You can find the following steps in Events part of the Special quests screen. All steps will expire at the end of the Halloween event at the end of Oct. 31.

How to get Jack-o’-Head armor, upgrade requirements

To get the Jack-o’-Head armor in Monster Hunter Now’s Halloween event, you must first earn 10 Pumpkin Tickets.

Here’s how it looks in-game courtesy of minimi_249 on Twitter / X:

Upgrading the armor then requires further Pumpkin Tickets, which can only be sourced from the Halloween event. Developer Niantic has said once you have spent 70 Pumpkin Tickets on Jack-o’-Head armor upgrades, further improvements will then only regular crafting materials. As such, this is a good number to aim for if you prefer to continue upgrading after the event ends.

Jack-o’-Head armor skill explained

Once equipped, the Jack-o’-Head armor has the skill Solidarity (Pumpkin Hunt). This is a party-based skill where having multiple players with the skill active increases attack power. During the Halloween event, this effect is increased by five.

As such, this is a rather situational skill, as not only do you need to be hunting with other players, but doing so during the Halloween event (which ends after Oct. 31) will see the most benefit.

It’s entirely possible this skill will appear in future armor pieces to increase its potency (such as during next year’s Halloween event), so crafting one now could be a sound investment for those looking to play with other hunters. Otherwise, for solo players, it might be simply a piece to add to your collection, especially if the ability to transmog (change the appearance of your armor) comes to the game one day.

Where to find pumpkin rock Kulu-Ya-Ku in Monster Hunter Now

A Halloween-themed Kulu-Ya-Ku holding a pumpkin rock will “appear in larger numbers than usual” from Saturday, Oct. 28 at 9 a.m. local time until the end of Oct. 31.

By its very nature, Kulu-Ya-Ku appears in all three habitats (Forest, Desert, and Swamp) meaning they can appear anywhere on the map.

Beyond the novelty of battling a Halloween-themed monster, taking down these special pumpkin rock Kulu-Ya-Ku will reward you with Pumpkin Tickets.

Niantic has confirmed any pumpkin rock Kulu-Ya-Ku tagged with paintballs during the event will continue to drop Pumpkin Tickets after the event ends — giving you extra time if needed.

entertainment,,2023-09-26T09:10:29+00:00,"Trust in God has been a foundational principle of the United States since the days of colonial settlement.

The phrase ""In God We Trust"" has been an official statement of national faith since the Civil War and the official motto of the United States since 1956.

It remains just as essential today as the United States faces cultural upheaval with numerous signs that faith is waning, Pastor Jesse Bradley of Grace Community Church in Auburn, Washington, near Seattle, told Fox News Digital this week.

WASHINGTON PASTOR ACKNOWLEDGES THE PAIN OF PUTDOWNS AGAINST THE CHRISTIAN FAITH: ‘ASK GOD FOR COURAGE’

""Abiding with God goes beyond and is more valuable than money, technology and entertainment,"" said Pastor Bradley, in a series of thoughtful comments when asked to tackle the state of America’s relationship with God.

""The soul of a nation is the core, the essence and the deepest part of a country,"" he said. ""Closeness with God is reflected and expressed in our relationships, the laws of the land, and morality. Real trust is essential in a vibrant relationship with the living God, not merely lip service.""

Survey after survey, however, along with countless anecdotal examples, paint an unmistakable picture of an America growing less religious and more secular.

The United States, it appears, no longer trusts God.

Many Americans and faith leaders believe the corresponding social decay, breakdowns of family, education, national heritage and basic science are the inevitable outfall of a society that’s lost its guiding light.

""Closeness with God is reflected and expressed in our relationships, the laws of the land, and morality."" - Pastor Bradley

Trust in God in recent decades appears to have been replaced by false idols of celebrity, technology and government.

""We have forsaken living water and created idols that can’t even hold water,"" said Pastor Bradley.

""America needs to come to her senses and realize the goodness of God.""

There are numerous signs that individual welfare and social cohesion suffer as God becomes a part-time or non-existent guide in our lives and our nation.

""We can't compartmentalize God into one day, hour or place,"" said Pastor Bradley. ""This relationship with our Maker is 24-7, as God is the source of our strength, love, security and hope.""

MICHIGAN SIBLINGS REUNITE WITH THEIR 3-YEAR-OLD BROTHER AFTER HIS 6-MONTH HOSPITAL STAY FOR CANCER TREATMENT

""In God We Trust"" is not a uniquely Judeo-Christian American concept. Some form of it has been expressed by other cultures, nations and faiths throughout history.

The motto traces its roots to the Old Testament, the foundational text of Western Civilization.

""In God have I put my trust; I will not be afraid what man can do unto me,"" states Psalm 56:11. A substantially similar phrase appears in the Quran.

However, trust in God became encoded in both America's foundational spirit and foundational documents.

""We are all equal before God. Religion does not make someone better than another person."" — Pastor Bradley

""We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness,"" reads the first principal listed in the Declaration of Independence.

FAITH DILEMMA IN FOCUS: ‘IT’S SUNDAY AND I HAVEN'T GONE TO CHURCH — WHAT DO I DO?'

Faith in God in the United States was not just a statement of religious faith, but a declaration of national identity and human equality.

God, the Creator in this case, was non-denominational — which itself became essential the principal of religious freedom in the United States.

""The motto doesn't nullify the freedom to choose faith. Nothing is forced,"" said the pastor.

NEW YORK VETERAN, 105, SHARES HER SECRET TO A FULFILLGN LIFE: FAITH, FAMILY AND ‘NO REGRETS’

""We are all equal before God. Religion does not make someone better than another person.""

The Founding Fathers paved the way for a society that enjoyed both faith in a Creator and religious freedom.

Trust in God, as the source of individual liberty and a defense against abuses of man, were bedrock beliefs among the Founding Fathers, regardless of individual philosophies.

Some reports indicate that the phrase ""In God We Trust"" was used by Pennsylvania troops in the American Revolution and again by the state’s soldiers in the Civil War.

""Then conquer we must/when our cause is just/and this be our motto/in God is our trust,"" Francis Scott Key wrote in the now largely unknown final stanza of the poem that became the National Anthem.

""I believe we are at a crossroads spiritually."" — Pastor Bradley of Washington

The phrase first appeared on coins from the U.S. Mint in 1865 at the end of the Civil War.

""In God We Trust"" was added to paper currency in 1957, after it was made the official national motto.

""In God We Trust"" on currency has been deemed constitutional in numerous rulings by the Supreme Court and lower courts.

The U.S. Congress voted to reaffirm ""In God We Trust"" as the national motto by a bote of 396-6 in 2011.

But faith in God today clearly faces challenges — with society at large likely suffering.

Emily Ratajkowski’s latest photo shoot has sparked backlash among plus-size models and activists, who claim it promotes unhealthy narratives about body image.

The supermodel, 32, recently shared several images from her photo shoot with M Le Monde magazine. For the fashion editorial photographed by Oliver Hadlee Pearch, Ratajkowski posed in a variety of looks featuring denim jeans and flowing tops. However, it was the second image that caught the attention of her Instagram followers.

In the photo, Ratajkowski is seen wearing a pair of low-rise, wide-leg denim jeans double her size. She showed off her toned figure as the oversized pair of jeans fell at her feet. As she held up the waistband of the jeans with one arm, Ratajkowski stood in one leg of the pair of jeans to highlight the noticeable size gap.

The photo shoot - which was styled by Charlotte Collet and creative directed by Jean-Baptiste Talbourdet-Napoleone - instantly sparked backlash after Ratajkowski shared the images to Instagram. In her comments section, thousands of users criticised both Ratajkowski and the team behind the photo shoot for the “out of touch” image and claimed the photo shoot was “fatphobic”.

Famous plus-size models and inclusivity advocates - such as Tess Holliday, Kelly Augustine, Stephanie Yeboah, Letticia Munniz, and Sarah Chiwaya - have called out the photo for emphasising Ratajkowski’s thinness in a pair of pants that would typically be reserved for someone who is plus-size.

“I’ve been looking for those jeans in the second photo if you could just please return them that would cool. Tysm,” Holliday commented under Ratajkowski’s post.

“That second photo is such godforsaken trash,” wrote Chiwaya. “In the year of our lord 2023?? STILL??? Yikes.”

“What in the fatphobic hell is that second picture?” a third user commented, while someone else said: “That second pic is so out of touch and ignorant but the comments are chef’s kiss.”

Plus-size models have long advocated for more inclusive sizing - both in stores and on the runway. However, luxury brands and labels often avoid creating plus-size fashion over claims that it’s too expensive to make. “Designers won’t make plus sizes unless it’s for a photo opp where a thin person can be quirky,” another person pointed out.

Many people were especially surprised by the “distasteful” photo shoot considering Ratajkowski has published a book of essays about feminist empowerment and the objectification of women’s bodies, titled My Body. “Not sure how you think wearing oversized jeans made for a much larger person and accentuating your smallness promotes healthy body image like you preach in your books/social media,” an Instagram user said.

Since she shared snaps from the photo shoot over the weekend, Ratajkowski has not yet commented on the backlash. Despite the controversial editorial, the model has previously spoken out against body-shaming. In her book of essays, Ratajkowski discusses bodily autonomy and exploitation in the modelling industry. “Every woman I know - doesn’t matter what they look like, or if they’ve commodified their image or not - knows what it feels like to be looked at, to be rejected, to get attention for how they look,” she told The Independent in 2021.

Back in 2019, Ratajkowski defended her friend against body-shaming trolls after their bodies were compared on Instagram. The model shared a bikini-clad post to promote her swimwear line, Inamorata, but several users accused Ratajkowski of sharing the photograph to make her body look “better”.

In response, Ratajkowski commented: “I love my friend’s body and both her and I think she looks great here! And I’m proud she’s rocking my suits. All these haters are crazy. Just because you’re used to seeing one body type on the internet doesn’t mean that that’s the only kind that should be considered ‘beautiful’.”

While the body positivity movement has made waves over the past 10 years, this year in fashion was especially devoid of inclusivity or plus size models. According to Vogue’s Business Size Inclusivity Report, only 0.6 per cent of looks shown throughout the autumn/winter 2023 fashion season were modelled by plus-size people.

Despite the fact that the plus-size clothing market is expected to reach $288bn this year, according to Future Market Insights, advocates have maintained that they’re unable to purchase clothing that’s both sustainable and inclusive. “I have to wear fast fashion and high street to major red carpet moments, and that’s great, but I want the option to wear high end items of my choosing and it’s not available,” Holliday told Elle UK in 2019. “But it’s either that or I run around naked. Plus-size fashion is not there yet.”

entertainment,,2023-11-17T12:01:11+00:00,"Synonymous with all things luxury paired with a rich history and heritage, Dubai has plenty to offer the traveller looking to immerse themselves in culture while also enjoying the finer things in life. A year-round destination, this diverse country offers a wide range of activities and experiences that vary depending on the time of your visit.

Over the winter months, Dubai enjoys balmy temperatures and pleasant weather throughout the season, making it the ideal time to get outdoors and explore it’s more active, adventurous side. While in early summer, as the temperatures climb, it’s the perfect spot for a blend of beach breaks and sightseeing. Finally, in the hotter months, June and July, its world-famous waterparks come into their own, while air-conditioned cultural activities and evening tourism (where you sight-see after sunset) are other season-perfect options.

For a stress-free start to your Arabian adventure, when you book with British Airways Holidays, you can enjoy great value breaks, with the quality and peace of mind you expect from British Airways. ATOL-protected, keeping you and your money safe, you can enjoy flexible payment options with deposits from just £75 per person* as well as 23 kg baggage allowance per person and 24-hour dedicated support helpline during your trip. Meaning, whatever time of the year you travel there, from the day you book, you can put all your focus on planning an unforgettable trip to this dynamic, luxurious corner of the world.

A winter escape

From desert safaris to quadbiking, head to the Dubai desert for a big adventure (Alamy Stock Photo)

If you’re the kind of person who’d rather spend their days exploring than soaking up the sun on the beach, then November and December is the best time to head for Dubai and get stuck into outdoor activities. The temperature, although still hot with clear blue skies, is a lot cooler than the sweltering summer months.

Dubai’s desert offers a wealth of heart-pumping Arabian activities to enjoy, from dune buggies to quad biking and desert safaris. Whizz through the desert on a heart-pumping dune drive, keeping your eyes peeled for local wildlife along the way – the desert is home to hopping gazelles, several species of reptile and the Arabian Oryx, a species that was saved from the brink of extinction. If you choose a desert safari, you’ll also experience traditional activities like henna tattooing and dance shows; many also culminate in an evening BBQ dinner.

The winter months are also a great time to explore Dubai’s fascinating history. At Dubai Creek in Deira, you’ll find traditional wooden boats, also known as abras, the oldest form of public transport in Dubai. These boats will take you from one side of the river to the other – a short trip, but it’s a nice way to get a feel for local life in Dubai.

Consider a stop-off in the historic Al Fahidi Historical neighbourhood located along the creek, where you can learn what life in Old Dubai was like. The area is dotted with original buildings and preserved infrastructure like traditional wind towers and the Al Fahidi Fort, one of the oldest buildings in Dubai, built back in 1787.

More history and heritage can be found in nearby Hatta, where craggy mountains and lush valleys cradle citadels, towers and forts. For jaw-dropping views over the historical village, hike up the dramatic Hajar mountains, one of the highest ranges in the Arabian peninsula. Be sure to stop by Hatta Heritage Village, a reconstruction of a traditional mountain village, where you can see how life was lived centuries ago.

If you do happen to visit in November, Dubai Design Week takes place around the start of the month. The region’s largest creative festival shines a spotlight on pioneering designers and all things creative via exhibitions, installations, talks, workshops and markets.

Beach clubs and festivals

May is also a great time for a trip to Dubai, particularly for sunseekers, with average temperatures around 30 degrees. Make the most of dining al fresco; the city is filled with beachside eateries and outdoor terraces. At Akira Back, which serves Japanese dishes prepared with Korean and international flavours, you can enjoy incredible views across Dubai Marina from its huge terrace. Or try Fish Beach Taverna, for must-experience Aegean seafood in coastal setting.

Whether you fancy soaking up the day’s rays in a luxury cabana or floating in an infinity pool overlooking the surrounding sea, there’s no shortage of beach clubs to get your sunshine fix in style. Melt into a cosy daybed at SĀN Beach or head to DRIFT Beach Dubai for infinity pool rest, relaxation, and chic French fare.

Foodies should coincide their trip with The Dubai Food Festival, the ultimate celebration of the local culinary scene, held at the beginning of the month. While for those looking to add some culture to the mix, the Dubai Comedy Festival takes place later in May, bringing together some of the best names in comedy for some side-splitting entertainment.

Splash parks and sunset cruises

Every month brings opportunities to explore something different in Dubai, and that’s no exception as temperatures begin to climb in June and July. These sun-packed months are perfect for those who really like the heat and are happy to spend their days cooling off by the water.

For literal thrills and spills, Dubai has made a name for itself when it comes to water parks. Wild Wadi, as the city’s first-ever waterpark, is a perennial favourite for adults and kids alike, with its exhilarating range of rides, surfing machines and wave pool. There’s also Laguna Waterpark, one of the newer parks on the map, located on the coast with an infinity pool and its own beach, as well as thrilling slides and a boat-themed kids pool.

Visiting in hotter months means you can save sightseeing and cultural activities for night-time, giving you an entirely different way to experience the city. Take an evening dinner cruise along Dubai Creek to experience the twinkling city night lights, or head up the iconic Burj Khalifa at sunset for stunning views across the city.

Further architectural highlights include the night-time lights of the Burj Al Arab and the Dubai Frame, a 153-metre-high structure built to resemble a massive picture frame, which provides incredible views of Old and New Dubai. Alternatively, make the most of the air-con, with indoor concerts and theatre shows at the stunning Dubai Opera.

Discover dynamic Dubai with British Airways When you book with British Airways Holidays, you can enjoy great value breaks, with the quality and peace of mind you expect from British Airways.

entertainment,Cass Marshall,2023-10-25T18:18:06+00:00,"The debate over “reaction” content on YouTube has been brewing for years, but a recent incident between two creators has refueled the urgency of the conversation.

The debate centers on Alia “SSSniperwolf” Shelesh, a YouTuber with over 34 million subscribers, and Jack “Jacksfilms” Douglass, a YouTuber with 4.9 million subscribers. The two have been feuding online over the past year, but it came to a head this weekend, as Douglass said that Shelesh showed up to his home and filmed the outside of his residence on Saturday. Shelesh shared a video of the incident as an Instagram story, saying “let’s talk like adults,” according to a report from NBC News. On Oct. 20, YouTube said that Shelesh’s account would be temporarily demonetized.

What led to this confrontation, and why did it ignite such a firestorm of controversy online?

What is ‘reaction content’ and why is it so controversial?

Reaction content is an umbrella term that applies to a content creator responding to or riffing on an existing piece of media. Reaction content has been controversial for a long time; in 2016, the Fine Brothers made an infamous attempt to copyright their “React” videos, which was met with near unanimous criticism. In August, the conversation reignited as popular creators like Félix “xQc” Lengyel “reacted” to long-form content with very little (if any) original input or transformative commentary.

How are Jacksfilms and SSSniperwolf involved in the reaction content debate?

Douglass has made content on YouTube since 2006, primarily focusing on comedy videos. In the past, he has called out “reaction” content that he says fails to meet the bar for fair use, and has even made parody videos reacting to reaction content.

Within the last year, he set his sights on Shelesh’s content, citing a lack of credit or links to original creators and their work, and a lack of transformative commentary. Shelesh has been a content creator for roughly a decade, including making YouTube and TikTok videos. Her recent work is largely reaction content, which she posts to both platforms. Shelesh has been aware of Douglass’ commentary, even making jokes about the YouTuber in her own reaction content.

In addition to Douglass’ video callout above, he revived an old joke channel called JJJacksfilms, poking fun at Shelesh’s content and celebrating times she deleted clips. He also regularly made content on Twitch reacting to and even grading Shelesh’s reaction content, complete with a bingo game for viewers to play. The JJJacksfilms streams were designed to apply pressure to Shelesh, encouraging her to credit original creators and provide substantial commentary.

The SSSniperwolf doxxing accusations

On Oct. 13, Shelesh posted an Instagram story with the text, “Should I go visit @Jacksfilms? He lives 5 mins away from my shoot.” She proceeded to add more posts to her story throughout the night, which included a photo of the outside of Douglass’ house and the caption “Let’s talk like adults.”

Douglass was livestreaming on Twitch when Shelesh posted these images to her Instagram story, and he disconnected and posted the following tweet on Oct. 13: “Sssniperwolf just doxxed me on her IG. Creepy, gross, violating,” wrote Douglass, alongside a screenshot of Shelesh’s Instagram story. “What you do is disgusting. You steal content AND stalk youtubers. @YouTube demonetize this dangerous ‘creator’ or just get her off your platform. She posted an IG story right outside our home and deleted it.”

As Douglass’ fans waited for YouTube to respond, they scoured Shelesh’s content, looking for potential additional rule violations. Shelesh also posted updates making light of the situation, including a since-deleted photo of her and her sister with the caption “We show up to ur house wyd??” and a post over Douglass’ tweet, captioned: “This creep has been harassing me for months then plays victim saying I threatened him when I just wanted to talk to him. I have no ill intentions. It’s so sad when people have to constantly create drama to pay their bills.”

The incident inspired a series of videos and posts from influencers and commentary channels, with public opinion largely being in favor of Douglass. Of course, the situation also inspired a fair few shitposts and memes — some of which were aimed at YouTube, encouraging the platform to respond.

Polygon reached out to Douglass, Shelesh, and YouTube and will update this story when we hear back.

YouTube responds

On Oct. 20, a week after the doxxing incident, YouTube and Shelesh both made public statements. YouTube posted a tweet confirming Shelesh had received “a temporary monetization suspension per Creator Responsibility policies.” The tweet also criticized “the behavior on both sides” and expressed hope that the incident would “move this convo to a better place.”

Confirming SSSniperWolf has received a temporary monetization suspension per Creator Responsibility policies. Off platform actions that put others’ personal safety at risk harm our community & the behavior on both sides isn’t what we want on YT. Hoping everyone helps move this… — TeamYouTube (@TeamYouTube) October 20, 2023

Shelesh also made a statement on X, apologizing to “Jacksfilm, YouTube, the entire creator community, and my incredible fans for not being a better example of conflict resolution.” She has since posted a handful of new videos to her YouTube account, with the comment sections disabled.

The response from both YouTube and Shelesh failed to address many fans’ concerns, considering the official comment from YouTube spoke about “both sides,” implying responsibility on Douglass’ side of the conflict. The demonetization feels like a slap on the wrist, which has only inspired further commentary among the community. It seems like, for now, YouTube is content to avoid the debate around reaction content and simply profit off of it from afar.",YouTube demonetizes popular content creator SSSniperwolf after doxxing accusations,https://www.polygon.com/23930845/sssniperwolf-jacksfilms-doxxing-accusations-youtube-reaction-content-explained,Polygon

Your time — and money — is precious. Polygon’s What to Buy has rounded up the best in gaming hardware, entertainment, tabletop, merch, and toys, and how to get them for the best value, so you spend less time shopping and more time enjoying.

A power bank, also commonly referred to as a portable charger, is an essential purchase for anyone who’s on the go with a phone, tablet, or a gaming handheld like a Nintendo Switch or a Steam Deck. It lets you recharge your precious gadgets one or more times via a USB connection, so you can keep talking, texting, or gaming throughout the day.

Power banks range in price depending on a few factors: how compact it is, what kind of ports it has, how much battery capacity it contains (typically measured in mAh), and how quickly it can recharge your devices.

Best portable charger for your phone and tablet

Today’s phones and tablets may differ in terms of their peak wired charging speeds, yet we’ve found some battery packs that should work well no matter what device you have. It’s true that some outliers, like Samsung’s Galaxy S23 phone, can recharge at 25 W or higher depending on the model, but many other Android phones and iPhones recharge via a wired connection at under 20 W — even less when you’re charging wirelessly.

How to pick the best power bank/portable charger for you Get one that lists the Power Delivery capability (noted as “PD” in the specs), and it should ideally match, or come close to, the peak charging speeds (in watts) of the devices that you intend to charge with it. The batteries we recommend for phones and tablets are also a good pick for the Nintendo Switch. However, the Steam Deck needs more juice, as do some mightier laptops that can receive power via USB-C.

In terms of tablets, picking either of the two power bank options we recommend below should be a good fit for what you may have. For reference, all iPads currently ship with 20 W power adapters, and so far, tablets from other manufacturers like Samsung and Amazon haven’t deviated far from that charging speed.

Whichever you choose, it never hurts to get some extra USB-C-to-USB-C cables. You can get this two-pack at Amazon for $15.99, so you can keep one at home and then put the other in a bag you bring around during everyday travels.

Best power bank for your Switch

The Nintendo Switch console with detachable Joy-Cons can receive a maximum of 18 W through its USB-C charging port (the Switch Lite is slightly less demanding). So, the very same compact power bank we recommend for phones and tablets can be used to charge your Switch.

Same note as before: We suggest buying more charging cables than you’ll immediately need (stow one permanently in the bag you frequently use). You can get this two-pack of 100 W-ready, six-foot-long, USB-C-to-C cables at Amazon for $15.99.

Related The best Nintendo Switch accessories

Best power bank for your Steam Deck

Each Steam Deck console includes a 45 W USB-C wall adapter, so it’s a good idea to find a power bank that can meet that power level when you’re on the go. Thankfully, some options exist that can do this. One thing to note during your search is that only batteries that support the PD 3.0 spec, including the two options below, can recharge the Steam Deck at its fastest speed.

Related The best Steam Deck accessories

Best portable charger for your laptop

The number of laptops that can recharge via USB-C is growing, making it possible to use the same charger to refill your laptop as you do your phone or Nintendo Switch. For instance, Apple’s entire MacBook lineup allows it, as do several popular Windows laptops, like the Dell XPS 13, Razer’s Blade gaming laptop, and more. The thing is, different laptops have different power requirements, so one power bank may not work well across multiple laptops.

If you have a 13-inch MacBook Air or Pro, or a similarly sized Windows laptop, the chances are very good that a 65 W power bank should be fast enough to recharge your laptop as you use it (check your power supply’s wattage to be sure). Keep in mind that if you’re trying to play games, or do other resource-intensive tasks, your battery may recharge slowly, or it may continue to discharge if your power bank isn’t powerful enough.

For more powerful laptops, there are bigger, more powerful batteries to match that can supply up to 140 W of recharging power. That’s currently a top-of-the-line spec, costing significantly more than our other options, and you’ll even need a compatible USB-C-to-USB-C cable to reach the 140 W top speed, as well as a laptop that supports the PD 3.1 USB-C charging spec.

One of the chargers we recommend below can match the speed delivered by Apple’s 140 W wall charger that’s included with 16-inch MacBook Pro laptops. On the Windows side of things, most laptops don’t go above 90 or 100 W at peak USB-C recharging speed, so you should be set with our picks.

It might be tough to justify spending $100 to $150 on a power bank just to charge a laptop. I get it. However, it’s easier to justify getting one if you frequently travel with multiple power-guzzling devices that you’d like to recharge simultaneously, as these are but a few available that can manage multitasking.

Got it Normal text size Larger text size Very large text size This story is part of the Sunday Life October 8 edition. See all 13 stories . Nine years ago, Michelle Andrews and Zara McDonald were both 20 and working entry-level jobs in Melbourne at women’s media company Mamamia. Covering late shifts, often on weekends, they’d regularly share an Uber home. A friendship soon grew out of their shared love of pop culture. “We’d be watching the same TV shows and listening to the same podcasts,” says Andrews, now 29. Their back-seat chats eventually led to an idea: Shameless – “a pop culture podcast for smart people who love dumb stuff”. The story of how they came to leave Mamamia – after having their idea rejected at the final hour – has been told many times. But these days, it’s not a moment they think of often, unless they’re asked about it in an interview. “It ended up being amazing for us that they didn’t want the show,” says Andrews. Fast-forward to today, and the women are now well known as the “Shameless girls” – co-founders of Shameless Media, a company built out of their passion for smart conversations about pop culture. “We feel so far removed from that time,” adds McDonald, 29, reflecting on their start. Since launching Shameless Media – the home of not just Shameless but also the Everybody Has a Secret, Shameless Book Club and Love etc. podcasts – in 2019, the company has gone from strength to strength. Today, it has 1.1 million followers across social media, plus 1 million unique listeners and 2½ million podcast downloads a month.

In those early days, McDonald and Andrews were self-funded, buying their own podcasting equipment and spending just $70 to print advertising flyers. Even now, McDonald and Andrews have never taken on any outside investment. Profitable from day one, Shameless Media now has 11 staff.

On the Sunday Life photo shoot in Sydney, the two friends’ support for each other is as obvious as it is genuine. Together, they discuss outfit choices and every comment from either woman about not being able to make a particular item of clothing work is enthusiastically refuted by the other. The respect they have for each other is clear, and it’s why they work so well together. Since launching Shameless, their lives have been entwined. Since meeting, they have been through break-ups, engagements and now weddings. When Andrews tied the knot with her long-term partner Mitchell Rees last December, McDonald was a bridesmaid. Now, McDonald is planning her own wedding, to partner Oliver Keogh, which will take place next year. Years ago, when discussing when, or even if, they each wanted to have kids, it was a conversation they knew they needed to have not just as friends but as business partners. “How do we do this and have a family if the whole business is relying on us showing up together at the same time?” Zara McDonald “I hate that we had to do this, but it was like, how do we have kids?” says McDonald. “How do we do this and have a family if the whole business is relying on us showing up together at the same time?”

The only way to ensure it wouldn’t be an issue was to create a contingency plan. In their case, that plan involved expanding Shameless Media by growing the team and up-skilling junior employees. While neither Andrews nor McDonald sees kids in her near future, they found it reassuring to work towards a solution. Regardless of the topic of conversation, whether it be personal or work-focused, the two try to be completely honest with each other. “We realised with every honest conversation we had, our relationship was so much better – it was far more intimate,” says McDonald. The relationship McDonald and Andrews have with Shameless listeners is also based on trust. Their podcast episodes are meticulously well-researched, book recommendations are solid and the advice given via their Ask Shameless newsletter aims to always hit the mark.

Credit: Hugh Stewart In many ways, the relationship between Shameless Media and its audience is much like that between the friends. It began with a shared interest in celebrity gossip and TV shows, before moving into more personal recommendations of books and podcasts, until eventually reaching the stage where life’s most personal questions can be asked and answered. Ask Shameless, which lands in more than 64,000 subscriber inboxes each Friday, answers reader questions about work, dating, friendship and more. The best of these advice columns have been published in a new book, 4am: Answers to the conundrums that keep you up at night. Andrews and McDonald’s second book feels markedly different to their first, The Space Between. Published in 2020, it looked to explore the complications of life in one’s 20s.

“We wrote it when we were so young,” reflects Andrews. “We truly had internalised this belief that for our words to be worthy of attention, they had to mine the deepest, darkest events that have ever happened to us.” This feeling is one Andrews has spoken about before, referring to an essay she wrote for the book which included details of her sexual assault. “I wish I’d just saved that for myself,” she says, adding that while she wouldn’t take back the essay, she would take back some of the details.

In it, readers trust Andrews, McDonald and other Shameless columnists with their quandaries on everything from infidelity to sibling rivalry. The book comes at a time when many young women have trust issues. TikTok is serving eating-disorder content to those already struggling, influencers and celebrities post undisclosed advertisements, and algorithms work to push everything from egg-freezing to injectables.

Only five per cent of the letters submitted to the Ask Shameless inbox are published. But after reading hundreds of requests for advice in the past three years, Andrews and McDonald are in touch with the most prevalent issues plaguing women today. One of those, says Andrews, is that “a lot of young women do not receive the basic level of affection, attention or love from their male partners”. While there are questions the pair don’t feel qualified to answer yet – such as when to have kids – there’s also a kind of magic in the fact that Shameless listeners have access to McDonald and Andrews while they’re still in the thick of these struggles themselves. Loading Building a brand on trust is both a big achievement and a risk. How worried are they about getting it wrong? Turns out, not very. Andrews and McDonald know what good advice looks like, and how to give it. “I think the best advice is often not a statement – it’s a question,” says Andrews. “It’s listening to what someone’s dilemma is, then posing a question that helps them re-frame.” As two women who are constantly being asked for advice, what are the questions they ask themselves? “What’s the next thing?” says Andrews, without hesitation. “I’m constantly wondering, what’s the next show that isn’t out there.”

entertainment,Ryan Gilliam,2023-10-04T20:01:00+00:00,"Diablo 4’s Season of Blood brings some cool new vampire powers into the fold, but the real star of the action game’s second season is its sweeping quality-of-life changes. Players will now have an easier time leveling up, gaining quality loot, and just navigating the open world of Sanctuary.

Game director Joe Shely and associate game director Joe Piepiora sat down to do a roundtable interview with Polygon and other outlets ahead of Blizzard’s Oct. 4th livestream, and gave additional context to Nightmare Dungeon changes, Renown, and more.

One of the most notable changes for players in Diablo 4’s second season update will be an increase in experience gains. Blizzard claims players will be able to reach the level cap of 100 about 40% faster than in Season of the Malignant — which already increased experience gains compared to Diablo 4’s launch. This process should be much smoother for players as well, as monsters will now match their levels between 55 and 75.

Shely told the panel that last season, players set a goal for themselves: Get to level 100. However, many players found that they were never able to hit that milestone because XP gains were so slow. This change should allow more players to reach the level cap each season, allowing them to play with a truly maxed-out build.

As for how players will spend their time at max level and where they’ll be able to earn some of the game’s most powerful items, enter the five new endgame bosses: Grigoire The Galvanic Saint, the Echo of Varshan, The Beast in the Ice, the Dark Master, and the Echo of Duriel. Each boss has its own laundry list of busy work for players to complete in order to unlock their encounter — such as completing Nightmare Dungeons above level 30 or completing Grim Favors — but they also come with Unique rewards. That’s Unique with a capital U.

Because the bosses each offer their own pool of Unique items, this process makes farming for that special helmet that much easier. Instead of running dungeons and hoping the desired item drops, players can just gather all the materials, kill The Beast in the Ice, and then do it all again if they don’t get what they wanted. The Echo of Duriel is perhaps the most interesting of the five, as Duriel has a chance to drop the ultimate, super-rare, uber Uniques that were previously almost impossible to acquire. To compensate, players will need to kill the four other endgame bosses each time they want to face Duriel.

Blizzard’s designers didn’t build these bosses to be as tough as the ultimate Uber Lilith fight. However, these bosses will (hopefully) prove a challenge to most players while still giving them a targeted way to farm some must-have items. The Echo of Duriel (who is level 100) will be the most difficult of the new bosses, but the reward will obviously be worth the struggle, considering he’s the only way for players to farm Uber Uniques in Diablo 4. For players who have more in-game gold than time, Blizzard also confirmed in our interview that players will be able to trade with one another to get the items needed to summon Duriel and the other bosses.

While these bosses are a form of milestone activity for players, Nightmare Dungeons will still exist as places to both farm for better items and push builds to their limit. However, the dungeons are becoming much simpler and less grindy. The design team has reworked several Nightmare Dungeon affixes to make them less obnoxious, and Nightmare Sigils now teleport players directly into the dungeon instead of to the door.

Teleporting to Nightmare Dungeons is one thing, but players will still need to ride their horses around the world if they want to reach events like Helltides and the new seasonal activity, Blood Harvest. Thankfully, mounts have also been improved in season 2. Horses are now faster, and their dashes will allow them to break through barricades in the roads. Shely told us that the mounts should be more intelligent as well, and they won’t get stuck on objects in the world as easily as before.

Two of the other biggest pain points — gems and Renown — are also getting addressed in this season.

The grind to accrue Renown — the resource players get for completing activities in each area — is no longer something players will need to partake in every season. Much like the Altars of Lilith change in season 1, players who’ve fully unlocked their Renown track with one character will never have to do it again.

Previously, players would have to max out their Renown — which all but required doing nearly every dungeon and most side quests in the game — every season in order to get all available Skill and Paragon Points. Not only is that not the case anymore, but (unlike with the Altars of Lilith carryover) you won’t need to first log into a character that’s completed the Renown track in order to propagate that data to the rest of your account. Piepiora told us that all of that data migration should happen without that extra step in season 2.

This is yet another massive 180 on the Renown system from Blizzard in barely five months’ time. When we asked about the massive shift, Piepiora told us that players simply weren’t having fun redoing the grind every season, hence the move here (as with the Altars last season) to alleviate the pressure on players to only play “efficiently.”

As for gems, these items will no longer take up bag space, as they’re now considered crafting materials. This change comes alongside a massive upgrade to the Stash itself. Stashes now appear in more locations — including all minor towns with a Waypoint in them — and players can search their Stashes for specific items and affixes.

These are just a handful of the major changes coming to Diablo 4 with Season of Blood. Shely and Piepiora told us that the focus on quality-of-life upgrades was largely due to season 2 being the first season where they and the rest of the Diablo 4 team could really listen to feedback. Because of how close Season of the Malignant launched after the release of Diablo 4 (just over a month), that season’s content was largely finished before players had really gotten to dive into the action-RPG. However, with season 2, Blizzard has been able to react more to player feedback and finally create some sweeping, specific changes that players have been requesting.

All of these changes, as well as the content for Season of Blood, will come to the game on Oct. 17, just a few weeks before fans are expecting Blizzard to announce Diablo 4’s first expansion at BlizzCon 2023.",Diablo 4 season 2’s biggest draw is its quality-of-life updates,https://www.polygon.com/gaming/23901914/diablo-4-season-blood-2-quality-life-blizzard-interview,Polygon

Bill Kenwright became Everton chairman in 2004

Everton chairman Bill Kenwright, an acclaimed West End theatre and film producer, has died at the age of 78.

Kenwright had surgery to remove a cancerous tumour from his liver eight weeks ago.

He had been on the board at Everton since 1989, taking over as chairman at Goodison Park in 2004.

The Liverpudlian was also one of the UK's most successful theatre producers and played Gordon Clegg in Coronation Street between 1968 and 2012.

Kenwright was awarded a CBE for his services to film and theatre in the 2001 New Years Honours List.

Everton said it was ""in mourning"" following the death of the club's longest-serving chairman for more than a century.

""The club has lost a chairman, a leader, a friend, and an inspiration,"" Everton added.

On 12 October, the Premier League club said Kenwright had a cancerous tumour removed from his liver six weeks before.

Everton said the operation was ""completely successful"", but complications meant Kenwright required a ""prolonged period in an intensive care unit"".

Announcing his death on Tuesday, Kenwright's family said he ""passed away peacefully"" on Monday night ""surrounded by his family and loved ones"".

""Bill was driven by his passions and devoted his life to them; his deep love of theatre, film, music and his beloved Everton, and the families they created,"" a family statement read.

""He impacted the lives of thousands, whether that be through the launching of careers or his unending loyalty, generosity and unfaltering friendship and support.""

In a multiple award-winning career spanning six decades, Kenwright produced more than 500 West End, Broadway, UK touring and international theatre productions, films and music albums.

""We will remember him with huge love and admiration - the shows will of course go on, as he would have wished, and his towering legacy will continue,"" his family added.

Leading Everton for almost two decades

Kenwright spent 19 seasons as Everton chairman, overseeing 12 finishes inside the Premier League top eight, including fourth place in 2005, while the Merseyside club were also FA Cup finalists in 2009.

Everton said he had led the club through ""a period of unprecedented change in English football"".

In February 2016, Kenwright sold a 49.9% stake in the club to Iranian businessman Farhad Moshiri, who increased his shares to 94% in January 2022.

But with the club fighting against relegation last season, an Everton fans' group called for Kenwright to be sacked and said it had ""no confidence"" in him as chairman.

Kenwright and the rest of the board of directors were unable to attend home games last season from January after what the club described as ""threatening correspondence"" was received before a game against Southampton.

Chief executive Denise Barrett-Baxendale, chief finance and strategy officer Grant Ingles and non-executive director Graeme Sharp have all since left their boardroom roles, but Kenwright remained in his post as chairman until his death.

In September, owner Moshiri agreed to sell his 94% stake to American investment fund 777 Partners.

The club said Kenwright had ""worked hard"" alongside Moshiri ""right up until the day"" of his liver operation to help facilitate the proposed takeover.

Moshiri said he was ""deeply saddened"" by the death of his ""great friend"".

""Bill was a force of nature and he certainly changed my life nearly 10 years ago when he first spoke to me about getting involved with the club he adored,"" said Moshiri.

""He told me about this incredible club, a club that not only has history and heritage but was also a beating heart of our community and for that I will always be grateful.

""He was a special soul, a man successful in so many different walks of life. We will miss him but never forget him.""

From the cobbles to the director's box

Kenwright started his career as an actor and landed his breakthrough role in ITV soap opera Coronation Street in 1968 as Gordon, the son of long-serving Rovers Return barmaid Betty.

He left Weatherfield the following year, but appeared back on screen with occasional visits over the subsequent decades.

Kenwright also began putting on plays in order to give himself roles and discovered he had an aptitude for pulling the strings behind the scenes.

He found big success by staging new productions of two musicals - Willy Russell's Blood Brothers and Andrew Lloyd-Webber and Tim Rice's Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat - and making them long-running touring hits.

He has also staged productions of The Shawshank Redemption, The Exorcist, Cabaret, Evita, Saturday Night Fever and The Sound of Music.

Among his current shows, Sir Ian McKellen is starring in Frank and Percy in London, while Twelve Angry Men, Calendar Girls The Musical, Heathers The Musical and Blood Brothers are all on tour.

Dame Judi Dench, Woody Harrelson, Billie Piper, Rob Lowe and Felicity Kendal have also starred in his productions.

Rooney leads tributes to a 'big inspiration'

Wayne Rooney, former Everton and England forward: ""Devastated to hear the sad news about Bill Kenwright. Known Bill since I was young and he's had a huge impact on me as a person and my career. Great man and a big inspiration. Thoughts are with all Bill's family and friends.""

Jamie Carragher, ex-Liverpool and England defender: ""Really sad news this. A huge Evertonian who served and loved his club to bits. I'll never forget his and Everton's support every year around the Hillsborough memorial. RIP Bill.""

Andy Burnham, Mayor of Greater Manchester and Everton fan: ""It does feel like the end of an era, Bill was a big-hearted person. Such generosity and backed so many people that needed help, perhaps people did not see that in the media.

""He had a deep love for his club and the city he was from, it is an emotional night.""

Actor Sir Ian McKellen: ""Like many grateful actors I am in debt to Bill Kenwright for employment. He seemed to have known everyone in the business and to care about them. Yet every chat would veer round to his equal passion - Everton.""",Theatre producer and Everton chairman Kenwright dies,https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/67203234?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=KARANGA,BBC News - Entertainment & Arts
entertainment,Patricia Hernandez,2023-10-19T16:01:20+00:00,"“I feel like the majority of my life has been in front of a screen,” Turner “Tfue” Tenney reflected amid tears. A fateful kill against Tyler “Ninja” Blevins back in 2019 had catapulted Tenney to fame, and his audience went on to outgrow that of Twitch’s most mainstream star. Yet in 2022, Fortnite’s golden boy — whose name is synonymous with the battle royale game’s most recognizable character, Jonesy — called it quits. For many, Tenney’s retirement video was a sign of yet another Twitch star grappling with burnout: sad, yet familiar. In essence, though, Tenney walking away from it all cemented the end of an era for the games industry.

Polygon is celebrating TwitchCon 2023 with a package of stories covering streaming trends and news from the show. Check it out!

Tenney was the real deal, a perfect nexus of undeniable charisma and tenacious talent on display at least eight hours a day for years. But his ascent was a complicated one that reflected many of gaming’s biggest growing pains during the influencer era. Tenney came up as an early Fortnite esports champion; we now know that esports is a bubble that’s burned millions of dollars. Tenney rode a Fortnite wave that raised billions of dollars for Epic Games; a few years later, the publisher laid off 830 of its employees. When Tenney blew up, everyone was salivating over Drake and what his livestream appearance signaled for Twitch’s future; now both the rapper and many of the platform’s stars are better known for promoting gambling over hits. Tenney spurred headlines after joining FaZe Clan, a gaming lifestyle brand so lucrative it was endorsed by celebrities like Snoop Dogg; FaZe Clan is now an infamous penny stock that tried to rip him off, Tenney says.

Where all these disasters converge is Twitch, the livestreaming platform that’s home to over 30 million daily viewers. Many would say the writing is on the wall for Twitch, after endless headlines about losing top talent, poor management, bad platform policies, and creator burnout. But the idea that Twitch has lost its way after an ostensible golden era is an easy narrative that misses something much starker. If Twitch is in trouble in 2023, it’s not because things have gotten worse. Everything you’re seeing is the natural progression of an unsustainable system. The prognosis has always been terminal; we’ve just refused to see it because it’s been profitable.

It didn’t take long for publishers to see that Twitch could make or break a game. Around 2018, Twitch and its personalities turned Fortnite into a juggernaut so powerful, much of the gaming industry started molding itself in its image. While an approachable aesthetic and surprising gameplay made for good viewing, what kept Fortnite from being a mere fad was the model. Before, content expansions and adjustments could take months, if not years, to hit, and you might have to shell out money to see any of it. Fortnite set a more cutthroat standard: free weekly content updates.

Epic could swing this ceaseless delivery because the bulk of its profits at the time came from its engine, which many games — including Fortnite’s competitors — license. It was these deep pockets that made Fortnite possible in the first place: The bubbly shooter was initially a flop before Epic perfected the formula. The cadence also let Epic quickly adapt Fortnite to whatever was trending or novel, whether that was Among Us or Splatoon. Much like Roblox, Fortnite became a game that could give you anything — and if Epic didn’t emulate it, the players would.

“You can’t replicate Fortnite’s growth from, like, the [content creator] standpoint and also definitely from the developer standpoint,” says a Twitch streamer turned game developer who requested anonymity because he isn’t authorized to discuss the popular AAA live-service shooter that he works on.

The conditions that made everything possible were unique, yet immaterial to publishers who could only imagine profits. Suddenly, “live service” was everywhere — and games like Overwatch, which couldn’t achieve a similar pace, were posed as disappointments by content creators.

Does an average player truly need their favorite game to give them something new, week in and week out? Developers say getting half of their players to actually finish games is unusual and worth celebrating, because the reality is that most people will never finish a game they start. Twenty-two percent of purchased games on Steam are unplayed outright. A number of things affect these percentages, like being a part of a sale or Game Pass, but the statistics still paint a picture. A reported 25% of players between the ages of 18 and 34 enjoy games between three and six hours a week, 28% play two hours or less, and 19% play between 13 to 24 hours or more, according to Statista. As they get older, fans apparently spend less time in games. In the most engaged age group, half of all players only log a couple of hours or so per week in their favorite games.

A serious Twitch streamer who goes live daily or logs a full workday during their schedule will typically play much, much more than the people who are watching them. Twitch streamers can’t stop; a mere two-day pause might mean losing thousands of paying subscribers. There’s a big incentive to keep up with live-service updates as well. There’s some FOMO involved; while certain events with special prizes happen yearly, other big occasions, like season finales, only happen once. But the numbers don’t lie: Your viewership will definitely be impacted by new patches that float the game in question to Twitch’s front page.

“Multiplayer games will start decreasing in viewership after the first week as the launch hype dies down and then it’s a question of how good the game is perceived to be that will determine its long term fate,” says StreamElements’ public relations director Chase. “With those in for the long haul, viewership tends to plateau and then spike when new content and patches are released or if it is supported by competitive events.”

While the playing habits of a Twitch streamer don’t represent the average player by any means, content creators certainly shape public opinion about games.

“Negative sentiment is very profitable,” says the AAA game developer, who noted that social media platforms are built to highlight popular — and sometimes caustic — content. This dynamic sets up an inherent tension between game developers and hardcore players like Twitch streamers, who are not the main audience of most games but are often some of the most visible players.

“I don’t at all think that streamers are embodying some typical player behaviors, like ‘Brandon,’” the developer continues, posing a name for an imaginary everyday consumer. “There’s definitely a model of consumers nowadays who probably parrot those sentiments. They did not arrive at those conclusions themselves.”

“There is inherently [a] vicious and negative cycle for everyone involved, for how live service interacts with Twitch as a medium”

The misinformation will vary, but Twitch both shapes that discourse while also becoming the very metric that people use to make sense of a game’s situation. It’s gotten so bad that people scrutinize Twitch longevity for single-player games, not just live-service or multiplayer ones.

And so, to keep up with expectations, games as a whole are getting longer — and more expensive. It takes multiple studios to keep yearly live-service franchises like Call of Duty afloat, as noted in the CMA’s report on Activision Blizzard. That same report says that the development budget of a AAA game can range anywhere from $80 million to $380 million, and seasonal updates in particular require anywhere from $50 million to $65 million to produce. For publishers, keeping up with the competition requires nearly as much money as making a big-budget game in the first place. For contrast, a modern Tomb Raider game had a budget between $75 million and $100 million, not counting marketing costs.

Marketing by itself has eye-popping numbers as well: A 2018 report noted that the marketing budgets alone for some titles can equal 75% to 100% of what was spent on development, effectively doubling the total production cost. The channels publishers will pursue are varied, but Twitch streamers command a percentage of it. In recent years, we’ve seen a shift toward personality-based promotion, with more and more publishers eschewing traditional press at launch in favor of coverage they can control. Blevins, by himself, apparently commanded a $1 million payday for streaming Apex Legends, a game that’s popularity can be attributed to its enormous Twitch-focused launch.

Who can actually compete in the environment all of these conditions have created? Giant publishers who make live-service games, mostly. All 10 of the most-watched games on Twitch in 2022 were live-service games with regular updates. And the cost goes beyond money. As Fortnite took off, developers at Epic Games said that they experienced months of crunch that required 70-to-100-hour weeks to produce that industry-shaping content despite the publisher’s deep pockets. That’s the model that a lot of this hinges on, an egregious work week that often still requires the cheap benefits of outsourcing and contractors who are routinely laid off. Things haven’t changed much since 2019 at some major studios: Diablo 4’s developers say they also underwent crunch to ship the game. Naturally, the action role-playing game had Twitch integration from the jump, and alongside a detailed content roadmap. There’s little incentive for any of this to change, even as big-budget games buckle under their own weight and studios are closing left and right. Not when publishers know that the longer a player is hooked, the more likely it is that they’ll spend money.

At this point, live-service games need content creators like Twitch streamers to stay solvent. According to the developer speaking to Polygon, streamers help old games transform into new and visible moments. Developers need live-service games to stay in the conversation, because the base experience can worsen without a persistent player base.

It’s “not even from a cost perspective,” the developer says, though obviously more players make profits more viable. “But [if] we don’t have 20,000 players, then matchmaking times are terrible. Or connections will be pretty bad because we can’t mobilize players together in a single match. There’s all these cascading effects.”

While a Twitch streamer’s livelihood depends on having a steady stream of content, the system taxes them, too. Tenney’s goodbye to his fans was a crushing one, because the path that led him there was fueled by lost youth and a dream. Over time, the promise of a dream job — get paid to play games! — became corporatized, and contracts turned things ugly. Tenney said he started feeling trapped, and he didn’t like how much his decisions started being motivated by money. Tenney is hardly alone here now that Twitch has “grown up.”

“There is inherently [a] vicious and negative cycle for everyone involved, for how live service interacts with Twitch as a medium,” the game developer, who also spent years as a serious Twitch streamer, says. It’s been years, but he says he’s still recovering from the burnout of livestreaming all the time.

“There [are] these enormous benefits for some people, but there’s also just, like, a lot of it just really grinds you down on both sides of the table,” he said, referring to game developers and Twitch streamers.

It was inevitable for things like sleep streams, uncapped subathons, and randomly generated AI shows to materialize on Twitch; content creators feel like they need to keep going, always

The burnout phenomenon has been at the forefront of Twitch’s public image, in large part because it doesn’t spare even the most successful creators on the platform. Twitch’s most famous woman, Imane “Pokimane” Anys, started streaming while she was still a teen. Then, it was just a hobby. Nearly a decade later, Anys grew to have one of the most impressive stints on the platform. Late in 2022, however, came a big change. She informed fans she would no longer stream all day, nor would games be her primary focus anymore. Instead, she pivoted to being more of a lifestyle and beauty personality who uploads on short-form platforms like TikTok, if and when she feels like it.

The evolution grew from a similar motivation as Tenney’s. In the video where she explains it all, Anys said that during her time as a full-on Twitch streamer, keeping up with the “rat race” often meant playing what was popular while being unable to do “basic human things,” like going grocery shopping. How could she, when streaming all day was the norm and there was always competition around the corner that was younger and more willing to stay live for longer?

It was inevitable, then, for things like sleep streams, uncapped subathons, and randomly generated AI shows to materialize on Twitch; content creators feel like they need to keep going, always. Barring that, live-service games are always at the ready. In her sort-of-goodbye video, Anys spoke frankly while quickly scrolling through her entire game history on Twitch. It was all live-service games like League of Legends and Fortnite.

In 2011, when Twitch first launched, content creation wasn’t fully a career and people still uploaded their photos to Facebook. Normal, everyday teens weren’t yet decrying the hungry maw of the internet, and the generational shift toward work-life balance hadn’t yet taken hold. Twitch happened at the exact right time, benefiting from a cadre of optimistic young users who grew up on the internet, happy to give away as much of themselves as they could. They didn’t even realize it was happening, in many cases, and they couldn’t imagine the unsustainable system it would go on to create. People were just having fun.

Things have changed since then. Twitch has crowned millionaires, like Félix “xQc” Lengyel, who wear thick diamond chains around their necks while streaming. At the same time, viewership is dropping after years of platform growth that was partially bolstered by the COVID-19 pandemic, all while top creators are streaming less. The gaming industry, which likes to boast about how much money it makes in comparison to other forms of entertainment, is laying off workers nearly every week at top studios. Meanwhile, the overall gaming market is shrinking. The cracks in the system that produces and promotes big-budget games are getting hard to ignore.

“I wouldn’t trade it for the world,” Tenney said in his goodbye video, which is overflowing with footage of esports casters and viewers in awe of his Fortnite plays.

“I’ve been doing this since I was a kid, man,” he continued, shaking his head. “I feel like my childhood and even some of my adulthood kind of flushed away. I feel like this is the end of the journey, man.”",Can anyone survive Fortnite as a job?,https://www.polygon.com/23920138/twitch-streamer-fortnite-tfue-pokimane-burnout,Polygon
entertainment,Kazuma Hashimoto,2023-10-19T16:01:50+00:00,"Twitch has always allowed for various forms of expression, so it was no surprise when VTubing found a home on the platform, quickly gaining popularity among English-speaking audiences in 2019. Since then, the novelty of avatar-based content may have worn off, but the format has stuck around. And VTubing agencies, which continue to introduce new talents and offer one of the more financially secure methods of pursuing this sort of content, are still holding on in an attempt to harness new talent.

VTubing exploded onto the wider North American and European markets when Cover Corporation launched the English branch of Hololive Production in 2020. Hololive’s English debut saw the introduction of long-standing talents in the English community, such as the extremely popular Gawr Gura (the most subscribed-to Hololive talent to date) and Ninomae Ina’nis. Even high-profile content creators like Pokimane pivoted toward using digital avatars weeks after Hololive’s first generation of English talents debuted. Brands, too: Remember the Tony the Tiger VTuber in August of 2022?

Many creators that jumped on the trend have since stopped using their avatars, but at the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, there was a large increase in VTubers on Twitch and other streaming platforms, like YouTube, as models and equipment became more accessible to the general public. Twitch has since gone on to highlight a wide variety of VTubers through its VTuber Takeover promotion, which most recently ran in August. Twitch also reported that VTubing-related content on the platform shot up by some 350% between January and August 2022. Despite this, some have argued that the VTubing bubble has all but burst.

Polygon is celebrating TwitchCon 2023 with a package of stories covering streaming trends and news from the show. Check it out!

“I do feel that VTubing has become less novel as the market has become more saturated,” says a streamer with agency Nijisanji who is not approved to speak publicly. “There are obviously some ups and downs when it comes to working with an agency as well, which requires a lot of patience if I’m honest. And there are some decisions that are made that sometimes don’t make a lot of sense.”

Agencies for VTubers manage their talents, often assigning them a manager that helps organize interviews, collaborations, paid promotions, and ad content on streams. Sometimes they can be financial advisors, but that is not always the case, as money made through agencies may include subscription or merchandise sales.

The source at Nijisanji notes that all talents within the agency are under nondisclosure agreements, which prevents them from sharing information with their audiences that could compromise their identity, or even inform viewers on why they could be graduating — which is effectively retirement for VTubers.

“Seeing agencies like Hololive and Nijisanji shut down entire branches or graduate talents without any real kind of information is heartbreaking for just about everyone involved in the process,” the source says.

In 2020, Hololive shuttered its Chinese division, graduating more than a handful of streamers. More recently, Nijisanji announced the abrupt graduation of one of its more prominent talents, Mysta Rias. He revealed that his choice to leave Nijisanji was due to burnout. And in August, the parent company of Hololive, Cover Corporation, announced that two talents would be graduating from its Holostars division barely a year after debuting. Statements from the graduating talents were not provided outside of an official announcement from Cover.

In some cases, VTubers are not given a choice and can be graduated prematurely, though the agency itself never specifies.

Independent VTuber NagamiMugi feels as though “corporate VTubing” is still a viable avenue for those looking to make a career out of the medium that can support content creation full-time. “I think VTubing content has become kind of stale,” she says. She goes on to mention that a lot of VTubers tend to be boxed into specific kinds of content — playing Minecraft or popular FPS games like Valorant. “In order for VTubing to continue to grow, VTubers need to branch out and create more content in line with other influencers,” she says.

“Agencies should allow for talents to experiment, so long as it isn’t hurting anyone”

Mugi says that if VTubers took cues from other content creators and explored options like lore analysis videos or short-form reviews, the scene wouldn’t be as stagnant. And like other VTubers, Mugi has dreams of going corporate. Already relatively successful, having created her own storefront that hosts collaborations and merchandise featuring other VTubers and artists, she has auditioned for several major agencies. She says that one agency asked if she would close down her business if she passed the interview phase and became one of its talents.

This isn’t entirely uncommon, as the source from Nijisanji mentions that some talents have been given strict restrictions as to what content they can and can’t create once their contracts with the agency expire. However, this can vary between talents and what is agreed upon between both the talent and the agency itself. So while agencies can be viable in terms of long-term growth for a creator, it is often strictly tied to the avatar associated with said agency. Both Hololive and Nijisanji give creators very little freedom in terms of presentation, whereas newer agencies such as Idol allow talents to create their own concepts. While that may feel overwhelming to some, it allows for the talents behind these models to flex their creativity and create a persona that otherwise wouldn’t fit neatly into the clearly defined boxes some agencies slot them into.

“Agencies should allow for talents to experiment, so long as it isn’t hurting anyone,” says the source. “Let people fail and still have that opportunity for growth in the future. More risk-taking and trying to branch out in other ways instead of simply just streaming or following preestablished methods.”

According to both of the people we interviewed for this story, this is an agreed-upon sentiment — that to prevent further stagnation, this not-so-niche form of content creation needs to reinvent itself and allow more freedom to its talents. Time will tell if larger agencies like Hololive (which reported 50% growth in its 2023 financial report) and Nijisanji will allow their talents to break the mold.",VTubers have reached their inevitable conclusion,https://www.polygon.com/23919506/vtuber-hololive-gawr-gura-nijisanji-agency-model,Polygon

One of the world’s most spectacular natural phenomena, at certain periods during the year the Northern Lights regularly light up the skies of northern countries that sit in the ‘aurora zone’ of the Arctic Circle.

The light show happens when electronically charged particles enter the Earth’s atmosphere from space, producing dazzling displays of green, yellow, purple and even red lights.

This is visible every year in some areas of European countries like Finland, Iceland, Sweden and Norway, while there are regular sightings in parts of Canada and Greenland too. Fortunately for Brits, you don’t necessarily need to trek to these countries to see the aurora borealis; sightings have become more frequent in the UK, with the lights seen as far south as Wiltshire in February 2023.

Although numerous UK locations have reported sightings in recent years, these do tend to be in northern areas of the British Isles. It’s tough to predict exactly when and where the spectacle will make an appearance, but we’ve rounded up a list of the best places where you might be lucky enough to see the Northern Lights in the UK.

Hebrides, Scotland

This northern archipelago off the western Scottish coast comprises hundreds of islands, split into the Inner and Outer Hebrides. While the Lights can be seen in Skye and other isles of the Inner Hebrides, your best bet for seeing the lights remains in the Outer Hebrides, likely on the islands of Lewis or Harris. The flat beaches and countryside are great viewing points, while the remote parts of the islands are subject to almost no light pollution. The exceptionally dark skies here are known to be good for star gazing; even if you miss the lights, there’s every chance you’ll see the Orion Nebula, the Milky Way and the Great Andromeda galaxy.

The ‘season’ here runs from September to April, though the aurora is most common in winter, when skies get dark in the late afternoon. In February, the Isle of Lewis hosts its own Dark Skies Festival, with events including live music, film and theatre.

Shetland Isles, Scotland

The most northerly point in all of Britain, Shetland lies closest to the North Pole and is a location where locals can expect to see the Northern Lights a few times every winter. Over 100 miles from the mainland, the remote isle is home to plenty of tranquil countryside and coastal scenery, providing dozens of spots where you can potentially watch the lights away from the light pollution of nearby settlements.

The season here runs from mid-October to mid-March, with winter again being the best time to try and see the phenomenon (there are less than six hours of daylight during the shortest days). Though light shows aren’t guaranteed during your stay, wildlife spotting, walking and exploring the towns more than make up for any disappointment should the aurora fail to materialise.

Cairngorms, Scotland

The UK’s largest National Park is another Scottish destination for potentially seeing the Northern Lights. The park is home to Ben Nevis, the highest peak in the UK, and one of the UK’s International Dark Sky Parks (areas noted for “possessing an exceptional or distinguished quality of starry nights”). This area is situated around the Glenlivet Estate, forming the Tomintoul and Glenlivet park. An area with “remarkably dark skies”, the region is busy all year thanks to its vast amount of wilderness to explore and wildlife to see.

While mountains and hills may block views, there are plenty of dark areas that are perfect for seeing the lights between mid-October and mid-March (especially those nearer the coast, where views are less likely to be interrupted by clouds).

Yorkshire Dales, England

With a northerly, light-pollution free location as the gold standard for seeing the Northern Lights in the UK, the Yorkshire Dales are an oft-viable destination. The aurora was seen here as recently as April 2023; the park is one of England’s Dark Sky Reserves and the largest in the UK, and will be hosting a joint Dark Skies Festival with the North York Moors National Park in February 2024. It has four Dark Sky Discovery sites (designated nationwide for “good sightlines of the sky” and a lack of light pollution), which are in Buckden National Park Car Park, Tan Hill Inn and both Hawes and Malham National Park Visitor Centres.

According to the park’s website, on clear nights you can see as many as 2,000 stars, the Milky Way and even the International Space Station. The Perseid meteor shower occurs in August, though the best time to see the Lights is still between September and March – just remember to wrap up warm and follow any aurora updates online or on specially dedicated apps.

Northumberland, England

Another International Dark Sky Park, Northumberland’s National Park reportedly boasts the darkest skies in the UK (so is also an excellent stargazing spot). Although it sits at a more southerly latitude than many other light-spotting locations, the aurora has been seen over Hadrian’s Wall and Bamburgh in the past, and the county itself remains one of the most reliable locations to see the display in England. Lights are only usually visible here after particularly strong geomagnetic storms, so it may be an idea to keep track of these if planning a visit. Again, the areas near the coast – themselves in an Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty – can be better for seeing the aurora due to the presence of fewer clouds.

Snowdonia, Wales

One of three Dark Sky reserves in Wales, Snowdonia also boasts the country’s highest peak, largest lake, its own section of mountain railway and 1,497 miles of public footpaths. The 823-square mile park provides views of the Milky Way and major constellations on clear nights, with the odd shooting star to make up for those nights where you miss out on an aurora borealis show. As with most places in the UK, you’re more likely to see the lights between October and March. For the best views, head to the lakes of Llyn Geirionydd and Llyn y Dywarchen or to Ty Cipar, between Llan Ffestiniog and Ysbyty Ifan.

While better known as a destination for walking, hiking and simply enjoying the peace and tranquility of the surrounding nature, the Lake District is also one of the best places in England to see the Northern Lights. The area is an exceptional place for stargazing too and is currently seeking to become an International Dark Sky Reserve. Though the lights are rarer here than in Scotland, the lakeside backdrops make for particularly dramatic surroundings if the lights do appear, with excellent view points at Grizedale Forest, Wasdale, the Langdale Valley and Derwentwater.

UPDATE: Nov. 25, 2023, 4:00 a.m. EST We've updated this story with the latest deals from the Walmart early Cyber Monday sale.

Early birds already know that Walmart launched its first round of Black Friday deals back on Nov. 8 and just dished out another round the day before Thanksgiving. Some of the retailer's most popular rollbacks have already sold out. Leave items in your shopping cart too long and you'll risk losing out on your haul.

Although the official Black Friday programming has kept us busy all month long, the big day has finally arrived — actual Black Friday. If you've held out until now to do your shopping, we've compiled a list of over 180 of the best deals from Walmart's Black Friday sale and highlighted our favorites from different departments. We'll be updating the list throughout Cyber Monday, so keep checking back.

What are Walmart's Black Friday hours in 2023?

The days of lining up outside big-box stores on Black Friday eve have officially ended, and we're not sorry. Not only is this kinder on Walmart employees, but it puts the kibosh on the kinds of doorbuster melees that often took place in the past. (They were a national embarrassment.)

For 2023, Walmart launched its Black Friday deals online first, with the last round of rollbacks going live Wednesday, Nov. 22 at 3 p.m. ET. In-person shoppers had to wait until Friday, Nov. 24 at 6 a.m. when Walmart stores officially opened their doors, although hours can differ depending on the location. Shoppers will have until 11 p.m. to finish their Black Friday shopping.

Of course, there's no need to brave the crowds. You can still find the best Walmart Black Friday sales online, and we've got a lot of them for you below.

Is Walmart holding a Cyber Monday sale?

Glad you asked. If you don't have time to shop the Black Friday sales or you missed out on a great deal earlier this month, don't you worry. Walmart just announced its official Cyber Monday sale will start on Sunday, Nov. 26 at 7 p.m. ET, exclusively on Walmart.com and the Walmart app. If you're a Walmart+, you can access the sale three hours in advance, starting at 4 p.m. ET. This is the first time Walmart has given early access to Walmart+ members for its Cyber Monday sale (although it usually does for Black Friday). The Cyber Monday sale promises deals on top gifts with savings of up to 80% on apparel, beauty, tech, toys, and more. Stay tuned for the best deals from the sale in the coming days.

Note: All newly added deals are marked with a ✨. Deals with a strikeout were either sold out or expired at the time of writing.

TV deals

Why we like it

The best Walmart Black Friday deals typically include giant rollbacks on TVs, and that tradition continues in 2023. Unfortunately, many popular 4K TVs sold out way before Black Friday officially began, but there are still solid cheap 4K TVs lingering. This 55-inch QLED TV was already affordable at full price and is now seeing an extra $50 discount, pushing it below $350. Thanks to its extra layer of quantum dots, you'll be able to appreciate rich colors and deep blacks even during the day.

The older version of our favorite portable Bluetooth speaker is decently loud for its compact size, IPX7-rated for waterproofing, and capable of charging other devices via USB (hence its name) — it's ideal for traveling.

Travis Kelce believes the National Football League’s coverage of his rumoured girlfriend Taylor Swift is a bit too much.

Following his game against the New York Jets on 1 October, the 33-year-old Kansas City Chiefs tight end opened up about the NFL broadcast on the most recent episode of his podcast, New Heights with Jason and Travis Kelce. In conversation with his brother Jason, 35, the two addressed concerns from longtime football enthusiasts who were frustrated by the constant Swift references throughout Sunday’s game at MetLife Stadium.

Not only did the football league promote last Sunday’s game by speculating whether the Grammy winner will attend the Chiefs-Jets match, but cameras were constantly panning to the star-studded suite. During the game, Swift was joined an A-list group of guests, including her best friends Blake Lively and Ryan Reynolds, Game of Thrones star Sophie Turner, and actor Hugh Jackman.

The NFL also introduced a special segment with Carson Daly and The Voice, where the famed host attempted to explain the specifics of football to “Swifties.”

In the New Heights podcase episode, titled “The NFL Needs to Calm Down”, Jason asked his brother plainly whether he thought the football was “overdoing it” with the coverage of Swift during the game.

“I think everybody is just, like, overwhelmed,” the Chiefs tight end replied.

“Take away your feelings for Taylor,” Jason added. “What is your honest opinion on how the NFL is treating celebrities at the games?”

Seemingly beating around the bush, Kelce remarked: “I think it brings a little more to the atmosphere, it brings a little bit more to what you’re watching. But at the same time, I think...”

Before his younger brother could continue his thought, the Philadelphia Eagles player chimed in: “They’re overdoing it.”

“They’re overdoing it a little bit, for sure,” Kelce agreed. “Especially my situation. I think they’re just trying to have fun with it.”

While sports lovers may not be too pleased with the NFL’s focus on Swift, the football league’s supposed obsession with ongoing Swift and Kelce dating rumours has paid off in terms of ratings. Per a Deadline report, NBC accumulated an average of 27m viewers, with a total of 29m tuning in during the second quarter.

“That’s gotta be an NFL record right there,” Jason told his younger brother, as he noted that about two million viewers were estimated to be female. “I think a few of them might have been there for Deadpool and, uh, Taylor.”

In the YouTube comments under the New Heights video podcast, fellow fans shared their opinions on the NFL’s coverage. “I agree the NFL needs to calm down. Pissing off football fans is not how you repay your boi [sic] for all he’s done for the sport,” one person wrote.

Another remarked: “Pity Taylor. All she ever wanted was to watch the football game. Now she’s being blamed and hated left and right.”

“The NFL needs to seriously tone it down and let Trav and Tay explore this beautiful thing they have going on in peace,” someone else said.

Elsewhere in the podcast, the brothers revealed the one person who was most delighted to see famous musicians, actors, and professional athletes all coming together for Sunday’s game was none other than “Mama Kelce,” aka Donna Kelce. On 1 October, the NFL players’ mother travelled from Philadelphia to New Jersey to watch both her sons play football on the same day.

“She’s been on top of the f***ing world, man,” Kelce told his older brother. He also acknowledged how his mother seemed to be loving the new guests in her family suite, watching her son play along with her. “I know mom enjoyed it,” Kelce confessed.

“I shot her a text. I didn’t get a chance to see her, so I shot her a text right after the game on the bus ride to the airport and was like: ‘Hey, mom, sorry I didn’t get to catch you before I left but I hope you enjoyed the game,’” he continued. “I appreciate you always trying to make it to both of our games.”

“She also told me thank you because she was in an alternate universe, she was sitting there with Deadpooland Wolverine,” Kelce added, referencing Reynolds’ and Jackman’s respective superhero movie characters. “It was a hot ticket, man, you know what I’m saying? That suite was rockin’.

“They were enjoying themselves. Somebody told me that everybody was enjoying themselves in that suite,” Kelce said.

Not only has NFL viewership increased since Swift began attending her rumoured boyfriend’s games, but jersey sales for the Chiefs tight end have reportedly spiked by 400 per cent, according to a report from the NFL’s e-commerce partner, Fanatics.

Following critcism the league is focusing too much on Swift, the NFL responded with an official statement handed to People on 4 October.

“We frequently change our bios and profile imagery based on what’s happening in and around our games, as well as culturally,” the message read. “The Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce news has been a pop cultural moment we’ve leaned into in real time, as it’s an intersection of sport and entertainment, and we’ve seen an incredible amount of positivity around the sport.”

“The vast majority of our content has remained focused on the game, our players and variety of other initiatives, including our Toy Story Funday Football alt-cast, the international games and more,” they continued.",Travis Kelce admits the NFL is overdoing it with their Taylor Swift coverage,https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/travis-kelce-nfl-taylor-swift-coverage-b2423936.html,The Independent - Life and Style
entertainment,Michael Idato,2023-10-19T18:00:00+00:00,"Breathtaking is fair. Like the ABBA Voyage show in London, it is hard to capture in words. In many ways, it’s a conventional space: there is tiered seating inside, and wallet-bruising bar snacks and merchandise for sale outside. Some parts of the rock concert experience will never change. But when the lights go down, everything changes. Around you, Sphere splits open to reveal a succession of environments, each more stunning than the one before. Though the structure is familiar - the audience seated in rows, the band on a single, central stage - the effect is overwhelming. In U2’s show, we journey through a succession of environments referencing the band’s creative history. For other projects, such as Darren Aronofsky’s Postcard From Earth, the Sphere’s sound system uses “haptics” to make the audience feel the sounds. U2 perform at the Sphere in Las Vegas. Credit: Stufish Entertainment Architects These are the technical specs: an interior 16K x 16K spherical video surface, the highest-resolution LED screen ever made with 268,435,456 pixels, and an exterior covered by 1.2 million hockey-puck-sized LEDs. There are 157,000 ultra-directional speakers – the boffins call it “beam-forming acoustics” – and there are “infrasound haptics”, which means the soundwaves are shaped to create both vibrations and waves of air pressure.

The comparison to ABBA’s show in London is perhaps the only approximate one: both are wholly enveloping experiences where the lights, sound and special effects are blended to push the audience’s senses to the limit. They differ in one key way; ABBA pushes its effects out toward you, largely to play smoke and mirrors with the on-stage simulacrums. Sphere, in contrast, more wholly and subtly envelops you. “They are both legacy projects made by artists who have the career and track record to be able to look at these things objectively in a way that a younger performer perhaps wouldn’t because it takes an entire lifetime of experience to make those kinds of choices and make it work,” Williams says. The two shows also share British music stage architecture firm Stufish whose work ranges from the Queen’s Platinum Jubilee, tours for Beyoncé and Jay-Z, Michael Bublé, Elton John and Madonna as well as the ABBA Arena in London. Stufish partner Ric Lipson (along with artist Es Devlin and producer Brian Eno) collaborated on the U2 project for Sphere. “With the ABBA Arena, it’s absolutely designed for that show, but you could also imagine that building having another avatar show in there, or indeed a live performance where people would use the technology that’s in the building as an immersive environment,” Lipson says.

“The Sphere does a similar thing, [in that] you have a fully immersive space, the video screen in the Sphere is vast, it has a huge number of pixels, and you can immerse the audience within this environment.” So what does all this mean for the concert industry, which has historically built its lucrative concert spin-off industry on the conversion of sports venues to rock concert stages? It certainly means the future is looking a little more ... spherical? And, from a technological perspective, a little more plug-and-play. “It opens you up to thinking about performances in different ways, both from a creative point of view, from a business point of view, from a sustainability point of view, and the ability to not have to bring your own structure and screen and [sound system],” Lipson says. ABBA’s simulacrums on stage at ABBA Arena in London. Credit: Johan Persson “We have Adele in Caesar’s Palace right now, which again is another large show that immerses the audience, but we bring everything in and every time we load that show out, it takes a week or so,” Lipson adds. “What’s interesting about the Sphere idea is that they are planning multiple spheres, and then you can think about shows being able to move from sphere to sphere.

“Both [the U2 and ABBA] shows are taking a bold stab at the next-generation way of doing shows,” Lipson says, but notes that the traditional blueprint of iconic artist and audience remains key. “I’m sitting in a regular arena right now with Madonna, we are doing a very exciting show that pushes the limits of a pop show balancing staging and audience, and we are doing things that will feel fresh for her audience and for the show.” Critically, says Lipson, the staging for the U2 show is elementary in real terms, despite its technological complexity. “And what’s interesting is that the Sphere, like ABBA Arena, is only touching the sides of what you can do,” he says. “In five years’ time and 10 years’ time, two years’ time, whenever the technology shifts, you’ll be able to do more.” By the numbers ... U2 perform at the Sphere in Las Vegas. Credit: Stufish Entertainment Architects The screens, for example, are a bespoke assembly of state-of-the-art screens. But behind those screens are “a whole new kind of speaker,” Lipson says. “In a regular show, the speakers are at one end pushing the sound down the room, so it’s louder at the stage end and quieter further away. [But here] because everybody’s sort of getting their own feed, everybody’s getting an equal volume. So hearing the show in there, sonically, may be better than anywhere.” When the Sphere venue is in cinema mode, it utilises the full range of haptics, that is its ability to shape sound into both vibrations that will literally shake your seat, but also waves of pressure that can be felt. To those, the haptic systems add both artificial wind and a range of scents, paired to key moments, such as scenes of rocket launches or wild storms. Scratch ’n sniff, anyone?

As far back as the 1950s, Hollywood used three synchronised 35mm projectors to send a single image into a huge, deeply curved screen and called it Cinerama. It clocked in at just 146-degrees, well short of the Sphere’s 270-degree view. Another 1950s technology, Circle-Vision 360, essentially nine cameras positioned in an outward-facing circle, was used to create 360-degree film images, the most famous of which was Disneyland’s America the Beautiful film. Drawing a little less fanfare than U2’s debut on the Sphere stage was the premiere of Darren Aronofsky’s Postcard From Earth, a 50-minute 18K resolution film shot to fit the 270-degree wraparound screen, using an 18K Big Sky camera, and featuring sequences shot in Greece, India, Mexico and the USA. The Big Sky, in layman’s terms, delivers an image that is about 40 times greater in resolution than a 4K television screen. From Vegas to the desert ... U2 perform at the Sphere. Credit: Stufish Entertainment Architects Like Lipson, Williams is cautious about becoming lost in the dramatic differences of scale, particularly when it is the storytelling of the bands and their discographies that are the key draw for the audience. The same principles apply, Williams says, whether the show is U2 at Sphere or, in another of his shows, Australian playwright Suzie Miller’s Prima Facie, starring Jodie Comer, on the substantially smaller stages of London’s Harold Pinter Theatre and Broadway’s John Golden Theatre.

entertainment,,2023-10-30T09:45:20+00:00,"Ouija boards and other attempts to converse with the dead are spiritually dangerous practices that should not be viewed as innocent fun, an exorcist priest told Fox News Digital.

""We too often forget that there is much more to this world than meets the eye,"" Fr. Dan Reehil told Fox News Digital. ""Angels, demons, spirits and souls do exist and they can have an impact on our life.""

Rehill is a priest of the Diocese of Nashville. In 2018, he received exorcism training at Ateneo Pontificio Regina Apostolorum in Rome, and was installed as the exorcist of the Diocese of Nashville that same year.

DO ANGELS EXIST? OVER HALF OF AMERICANS SAY YES, STUDY FINDS: ‘COMFORT AND REASSURANCE’

An exorcist, said Reehil, ""is a priest chosen and installed by a bishop to exercise the office of deliverance ministry. Exorcism is a specific form of prayer that the [Catholic] Church uses against the power of the devil.""

The Catholic Church distinguishes between two forms of exorcisms, said Reehil. Exorcisms are either ""major"" or ""minor.""

""A major exorcism is performed only for one, who is demonstrably possessed by a demon or demons, and may only be performed by a priest the bishop has specifically permitted to do so,"" said Reehil.

Conversely, a minor exorcism is associated with sacraments and blessings, said Reehil.

""Demonologists distinguish three levels of demonic incursion,"" explained Reehil. These three levels are temptation, obsession (which is also called ""oppression"") and possession.

'HALLOW' PRAYER APP ACCOMPLISHED ITS GOAL DURING THE GOP DEBATE, COMPANY SAYS: 'PRAY WITH ME REAL QUICK'

Temptation, said Reehil, is something experienced by everyone.

Obsession is ""when demons torment people physically, spiritually, mentally or emotionally, or some combination of these.""

Possession, which is arguably the most well-known of the three levels, is when a demon or demons ""take physical possession of a person's body and make use of its faculties,"" said Reehil.

""Possession is usually intermittent, almost never an uninterrupted possessing of the person’s body,"" he added.

Attempting occult practices, such as purportedly trying to contact the dead via an Ouija board, are a way to open oneself up to demonic activity inadvertently, said Reehil.

""Demons lie and impersonate dead people,"" said Reehil. ""When asking a board for information about a deceased person, or a life decision, they are all too happy to embed themselves into your life. Using an Ouija board is inviting a demon into your life, whether the person has that intention or not.""

The Ouija board was first developed in the late 19th century as a parlor game; these were formerly called ""talking boards.""

At the time, séances and other spiritual practices were quite popular activities.

AS CATHOLIC CHURCH FACES PRECARIOUS CULTURAL TIME, BISHOP ROBERT BARRON OF MINNESOTA MODELS THOUGHTFUL FAITH

The board consists of an alphabet, the words ""yes,"" ""no,"" ""goodbye,"" and the numbers zero through nine.

To operate the board, a person places their hands on a ""planchette,"" which spirits purportedly move to spell out answers to questions.

In 1890, a Baltimore spiritualist and medium named Helen Peters asked the talking board what she should call it, said the website for the Talking Board Historical Society. The board responded ""O-U-I-J-A,"" which it said meant ""good luck.""

The Ouija board was patented the following year.

Legend regarding the Ouija board's patent says that Peters accompanied attorney Elijah Bond to the patent office, where the two were instructed by the patent officer to prove that the board worked by spelling out his name, said Smithsonian Magazine.

THE EXORCIST, CHUCKY AND NEW HORRIFIC HAUNTS HIT UNIVERSAL STUDIOS ORLANDO'S HALLOWEEN HORROR NIGHTS

Peters reportedly asked spirits for assistance, and then spelled out the patent officer's name.

It is unclear if Bond or Peters somehow knew the patent officer's name ahead of time, but the patent was awarded on Feb. 10, 1891, by a ""white-faced and visibly shaken patent officer,"" said the magazine.

The boards were then mass-produced by the Kennard Novelty Company, which was sold to Parker Brothers in 1967.

Today, the Ouija board is produced by Hasbro, which markets the product as a way to communicate with the ""spirit world."" Fox News Digital reached out to Hasbro for comment but did not hear back by publication time.

""Enter the world of the mysterious and mystifying with the Ouija board! You've got questions and the spirit world has answers — and the uncanny Ouija board is your way to get them,"" said the Hasbro website.

HALLOWEEN HORROR MOVIE HOMES AND THE STORIES BEHIND THEM: WOULD YOU DARE TO VISIT?

""What do you want to know? Ask your question with a friend using the planchette that comes with the board, but be patient and concentrate because the spirits can't be rushed. Handle the Ouija board with respect and it won't disappoint you,"" said the website.

While the Ouija board is marketed as a toy or board game, Reehil, from his point of view, disagrees with this characterization.

Divination and other occult practices are condemned by the Bible numerous times, said Fr. Reehil.

""Ouija boards should not be viewed in the same way as a typical board game,"" he said. ""Although it is advertised as a game, it is far from it,"" he added. ""Rather, it is a form of divination.""

Divination and other occult practices are condemned by the Bible numerous times, Reehil noted.

""The very action of using [the Ouija board] has profound spiritual consequences [that are] beyond our control,"" he said.

Perhaps the most famous instance of purported demonic possession connected to Ouija board usage was the case of ""Roland Doe,"" a young teenage boy from Maryland, who underwent numerous major exorcisms in 1949, said Reehil.

Doe's story was adapted into the 1971 book ""The Exorcist"" by William Peter Blatty, which was then made into the 1973 movie starring Ellen Burstyn and Linda Blair.

Reehil told Fox News Digital that he has personally seen six cases of demonic oppression that stemmed from Ouija board usage.

""The victims were left with night terrors, suicidal ideation, despair — and one man was impaled with chicken bones in his leg that flew across the kitchen,"" he said.

""Stay away from all forms of occult practices — and stay close to God.""

""Once the deliverance prayers were prayed, and the participants renounced all participation with the demons, the demonic activity ceased,"" he also said.

""Whenever we seek to engage demons, we move away from the One True God,"" said Reehil.

Polygon’s What to Watch highlights the best, the funniest, the scariest, and the most exciting in movies, TV, and everything in between. Stop scrolling, start watching!

Whether it’s something gory and macabre, silly and irreverent, or eerie and unsettling, the genre of horror is as rich and varied as the multitude of ghosts, ghoulies, and homicidal maniacs that go bump in the night.

Looking for the best horror films available to stream on Netflix, Hulu, Max, and Paramount Plus? No worries, we’ve got the goods. We’ve combed through the libraries of each of the major streaming platforms to bring you a list of our most recommended horror movies. Here are the best horror movies you can stream right now, from old classics to new hits. Our latest update added Encounters of the Spooky Kind.

Editor’s pick: Encounters of the Spooky Kind

Director: Sammo Hung

Cast: Sammo Hung, Chung Fat, Dick Wei

Where to watch: Criterion Channel

This Halloween, I had one goal: Finally watch Sammo Hung’s jiangshi (Chinese hopping vampire) martial arts comedy Encounters of the Spooky Kind. It was finally added to streaming via the Criterion Channel earlier this fall after years of being unavailable digitally. And reader, my priorities were correct, because this movie is an absolute blast.

Best known for his collaborations with childhood friends Jackie Chan and Yuen Biao, Sammo’s excellence as a director, choreographer, and performer are on full display in what is frequently a one-man show.

Sammo directed the movie, co-wrote it, choreographed the action, and stars as Bold Cheung, a pedicab driver and skilled martial artist who’s also kind of a dolt. He is dared to spend the night in a haunted house with a hopping vampire — a dare he accepts, because he is “Bold” Cheung, after all. What follows is a Looney Tunes-style slapstick action horror movie with legitimate scares (the vampire makeup is terrific: gray with a gross texture, like a wet papier-mâché mask), dazzling rhythmic martial arts choreography, and perfectly placed dashes of comedy (there’s even an extended Duck Soup homage).

Sammo is truly one of the greatest directors to ever do it, but he doesn’t get the proper credit globally because of the genres (and nation) he’s primarily worked in. The jaw-dropping choreography and onslaught of funny bits are outstanding, but it’s his skill with the camera that has always separated Sammo from his counterparts.

Bringing it back to his old friend Yuen Biao for a second — Biao co-stars as the silent vampire, and does a terrific job selling the undead creature’s fight sequences with stiff limbs and startling hops. This movie is colorful, funny, scary, tense, and an incredibly fun time. If you like the Evil Dead movies, this is one you must check out; Sam Raimi basically directly ripped one of Spooky Kind’s fight sequences for Evil Dead II. —Pete Volk

Alone

Director: John Hyams

Cast: Jules Willcox, Marc Menchaca, Anthony Heald

Where to watch: Hulu, Kanopy

A taut spine-chiller from John Hyams (Universal Soldier: Day of Reckoning), Alone is your classic woman-on-the-run thriller. Jessica (Jules Willcox), a recent widow, is in the midst of moving. If that wasn’t enough stress, a creepy man (Marc Menchaca) appears to be following her on the road. After he slashes her tires, she crashes and wakes up in his basement. What follows is a tightly crafted thriller with great performances, outstanding direction, and enough tension to keep your heart pounding throughout the 98-minute running time. —Pete Volk

Annihilation

Director: Alex Garland

Cast: Natalie Portman, Jennifer Jason Leigh, Gina Rodriguez

Where to watch: Netflix

Annihilation might be the creepiest movie about plants ever made (with all due respect to The Ruins.)

Annihilation follows a group of scientists (played by a phenomenal group of actors) investigating an area struck by a meteor. The area that was hit has slowly spread and grown into what’s now known as The Shimmer, an area where nature seems to be taking over everything around it, but it’s a different kind of nature; strange, unnaturally green plants grow over everything, and creatures (animals and humans) slowly merge with the vegetation around them. At the center of all of this is a lighthouse the group must reach. Annihilation helps realize this strange Earth-but-not incredibly well, with beautiful and haunting production design and a finale as memorable as any horror movie on this list. — Austen Goslin

Climax

Director: Gaspar Noé

Cast: Sofia Boutella, Romain Guillermic, Souheila Yacoub

Where to watch: Showtime

Climax isn’t for the faint-of-heart — and we’re saying that in the context of a horror movies list. The movie is set at an all-night dance party inside a gymnasium, which turns sour after someone spikes the sangria with a little too much LSD. Climax is told in beautifully disorienting long takes that go from dozens of minutes of uninterrupted and propulsive dance sequences to hazy walks through hallways as the camera mimics the dizzy stumbling of the movie’s characters. As the psychedelics kick in, so too do some of the attendees’ long-held feuds, leading to disastrous and horrifying consequences. It’s rare that a movie truly defies description, but if you’ve got a strong stomach and a will to see something you haven’t before, Climax is the perfect movie for you. —AG

Crimes of the Future

Director: David Cronenberg

Cast: Viggo Mortensen, Léa Seydoux, Kristen Stewart

Where to watch: Hulu

Microplastics: They’re everywhere!

They’re in our lungs, our blood, our food and drinking water; even the air we breathe. What the fuck is it doing to our bodies? We don’t really know, but David Cronenberg’s 2022 body horror drama sure has an idea of what it might mean for our children. Crimes of the Future imagines a world where humans have lost the ability to feel pain. In addition to that, several people have developed a disturbing disorder which causes their bodies to spontaneously spawn new organs.

This new reality has spawned a trend: Live surgery, wherein performance artists plagued with this condition tear into their own bodies in an effort to shape meaning out of this strange new biological fact. Viggo Mortensen stars as Saul Tenser, a world-renowned performance artist who, alongside his partner Caprice (Léa Seydoux), stands on the cutting edge — both literally and figuratively — of this cultural phenomenon. When Saul’s activities catch the attention of a mysterious group of evolutionary activists, as well as the lascivious eye of a government employee named Timlin (Kristen Stewart), he’s forced to confront what he — and everyone else around him — is changing into, and whether what that is can even be considered “human” anymore.

As macabre as it is moving, grotesque as it is sensuous; Crimes of the Future is an exquisite work of science fiction horror where surgery is the new sex and our very bodies have rebelled against us for the incalculable destruction we have inflicted on the planet. It’s a film that exists in intimate conversation with the anxieties of our present, as well as one that represents a stunning return to form for one of cinema’s most forward-thinking directors. Howard Shore’s growling, guttural score is engrossing, while the leading trio of performances by Mortensen, Seydoux, and Stewart are a virtual match made in heaven in bringing to life this speculative slice of post-human hell on Earth. In short: It’s a great film and highly recommended, but whatever you do, don’t see it on a full stomach. Trust me. —Toussaint Egan

Cure

Director: Kiyoshi Kurosawa

Cast: Kōji Yakusho, Tsuyoshi Ujiki, Anna Nakagawa

Where to watch: Criterion Channel

Kiyoshi Kurosawa’s 1997 horror masterpiece Cure follows Kenichi Takabe (Kōji Yakusho), a Japanese detective frustrated by an inexplicable rash of seemingly unconnected murders that nevertheless all appear to be connected, despite none of the perpetrators having known each other or having any recollection as to what possessed them to do it. When Takabe’s investigation leads him to a suspect, a student of psychology and mesmerism known as Mamiya (Masato Hagiwara), he finds himself plunged into a conspiracy that threatens to engulf anyone who gets too close.

In Cure, violence is less an act of premeditation or passion as it is a virus, coursing its way through the bloodstream of society, corrupting innocent bystanders not unlike aberrant cancer cells attacking from within without ever understanding why they did so in the first place. How do you confront a horror like that, much less stop it? The answer is as simple as it is terrifying: You can’t. —TE

Eyes Without a Face

Director: Georges Franju

Cast: Pierre Brasseur, Édith Scob, Alida Valli

Where to watch: Max, The Criterion Channel

Georges Franju’s influential 1960 film is a master class in supernatural fantasy horror. An unsettling tale about a plastic surgeon (played by Pierre Brasseur) who kidnaps young women and performs surgery on them to try and find a face replacement for his daughter (Édith Scob), Eyes Without a Face is equal parts haunting and beautiful. Scob’s iconic face mask in the movie was later referenced in her role in the also-excellent Holy Motors many decades later. —PV

Hellraiser

Director: Clive Barker

Cast: Andrew Robinson, Clare Higgins, Ashley Laurence

Where to watch: Prime Video, AMC+, Shudder, Tubi, Pluto, Hoopla

Clive Barker’s 1987 directorial debut adapts his 1986 novella The Hellbound Heart to tell the story of Larry (Andrew Robinson) and Julia Cotton (Clare Higgins). The Cottons are a married couple who move into the home of Larry’s recently deceased brother, Frank (Sean Chapman), with whom Julia had a previous affair. After inadvertently being resurrected by a drop of blood spilled by Larry on the floor of the house’s attic, Frank seduces Julia into luring new men to the house so that he can drain their life force and fully regain his mortal form. Surrounding this core narrative is the the story of the Lament Configuration, a puzzle box Frank acquired before his untimely death. When solved, it conjures hellish beings known as Cenobites to the mortal plane of existence, which indulge in hellish exercises of sadomasochistic mutilation. Easily the best and most enduring of the Hellraiser movie series, Barker’s 1987 original is a must-watch for horror fans. —TE

Hereditary

Director: Ari Aster

Cast: Toni Collette, Alex Wolff, Milly Shapiro

Where to watch: Max

Hereditary is a victim of its own success. The poster child for the misguided term “elevated horror,” and the subject of more than a few memes (particularly around telephone poles), the thing that often gets lost about Hereditary is that it’s actually really fucking good. And it’s damn scary too.

The movie follows Annie Graham, a difficult mother of two, who just lost her mom. During the funeral service, Annie notices quite a few people are here to mourn the mother she thought had no friends. She eventually learns this group of old people all belonged to the same bizarre semi-cult her mother did. And that’s where the witchy stuff starts.

From there everything descends into a complicated mishmash of tightly coiled family drama, supernatural plotting, and years-old resentments, and it’s absolutely excellent. Who’s to say which is scarier in this movie, the verbal immolation or the literal one?

Even if you’ve seen it already, you probably owe this movie a rewatch. You definitely remember that it’s good, but you probably don’t remember just how great it really is. Hereditary is elegantly creepy, right up until the point that it becomes terrifying. You can’t really ask any more from a horror movie than that. —Austen Goslin

The Host

Director: Bong Joon-ho

Cast: Song Kang-ho, Byun Hee-bong, Park Hae-il

Where to watch: Max, Roku Channel, Hoopla, Kanopy

The Host was Bong Joon-ho’s follow-up to the smash success serial killer drama Memories of Murder. A critical and commercial success, it was the highest-grossing South Korean film ever after its release and won Best Film at the Asian Film Awards and the Blue Dragon Film Awards.

Years after chemicals are dumped into the Han River, a huge mutated fish monster emerges and kidnaps a young girl. Her father (Song Kang-ho) sets out to find and rescue her, before being kidnapped by the American scientists responsible for its existence. A fun monster thriller that doubles as insightful commentary on U.S. intervention, ecological disasters, and much more, The Host is a high mark in Bong’s impressive filmography. —PV

House

Director: Nobuhiko Obayashi

Cast: Kimiko Ikegami, Miki Jinbo, Kumiko Ohba

Where to watch: Max, Criterion Channel

Few movies are as weird and excellent as Nobuhiko Obayashi’s House.

The bizarre ghost story follows a group of school girls who take a vacation to a haunted mansion in the countryside of Japan. Everything starts off well enough, but before long the kids are being attacked by demonic gates, getting eaten by pianos, or opening portals to hell — all with visually an inventive silliness few movies have ever matched. House isn’t all that scary, but it is weird in all the best ways, and nothing else looks or feels like it. — AG

In the Mouth of Madness

Director: John Carpenter

Cast: Sam Neill, Julie Carmen, Jurgen Prochnow

Where to watch: YouTube

Among the wildest movies John Carpenter has ever made (and that’s saying something), In the Mouth of Madness follows insurance investigator John Trent (Sam Neill), who is hired to find a missing fame horror novelist. Things become increasingly unhinged as the plots of the author’s books and the various monsters seem to invade the real world. Neill, a staple of this list, is absolutely fantastic responding to the horrors of hell, slowly becoming exactly as off-kilter as they are. By the time the movie makes it to the third act, the door to hell is halfway open and Trent is ready to dive headfirst into the void, which is honestly how every movie’s third act should go.

This is also the third in Carpenter’s apocalypse trilogy, which also includes two other stone-cold classics, The Thing and Prince of Darkness. They aren’t on this list, but you should watch them anyway. — AG

Let the Right One In

Director: Tomas Alfredson

Cast: Kåre Hedebrant, Lina Leandersson, Per Ragnar

Where to watch: Hulu, Prime Video, Roku Channel, Crackle, Hoopla, Kanopy

A 12-year-old Swedish boy finds a friend in a vampire who looks roughly his age, but is actually an old vampire permanently trapped in the body of a young child. The film is kaleidoscopic, each viewing revealing something different than the last. The first time I saw the film, I was a pessimistic college student, and I read the central relationship as a warning about the parasitic nature of love. After college, the children’s bond reminded me of the impermanence of youth, and why growing up is a mixed blessing. This past year, I was far more focused on the girl’s relationship with her caretaker, an older man who sacrifices everything for her existence.

The film was adapted from John Ajvide Lindqvist’s 2004 novel of the same name, which inspired not just this Swedish film, but a 2010 American adaptation, a comic-book prequel, and two stage plays. The latter has its own legacy — it was adapted by the magnificent National Theater of Scotland, and it eventually had a run at St. Ann’s Warehouse in 2015. Few books inspire so much additional great art. So I suppose I’m recommending the book just as much as the film. —Chris Plante

Malignant

Director: James Wan

Cast: Annabelle Wallis, Maddie Hasson, George Young

Where to watch: Max

There was just no way to see it coming. After the Conjuring and Insidious franchises, plus blockbuster turns with Furious 7 and Aquaman, James Wan could have cashed in chips to make another moody franchise-starter to stretch his jump-scare muscles. Instead, he made Malignant, a high-emotion giallo stuffed into dingy ’90s direct-to-video pastiche like some kind of horror-movie turducken. Wan pulls back the layers in an almost tedious fashion: The pregnant Madison (Annabelle Wallis) is first the victim of domestic abuse, then she encounters another killer, and then she starts dealing with psychotic episodes tied to her childhood imaginary friend Gabriel, and theeeeen it’s revealed… Well, please go behold it.

Strung together with a melodramatic cover of The Pixies’ “Where Is My Mind,” reveling in horror tropes to the point of parody, the final twists of Malignant are some of the most gratifying lunacy of the year, and the acrobatic actor Marina Mazepa brings it all home in a display of gruesome ballet. I won’t explain anything more out of fear of spoilers — just get on the Malignant train. Wan put his dream (nightmare?) on screen for us all to enjoy. —Matt Patches

The Mist

Director: Frank Darabont

Cast: Thomas Jane, Marcia Gay Harden, Laurie Holden

Where to watch: Digital rental/purchase

Any fan of Stephen King worth their salt knows that the so-called king of horror has a lot of movie adaptations of his work. Few films have managed to eclipse, let alone successfully adapt, King’s capacity for horror storytelling, with the exception of (a) Stanley Kubrick’s The Shining and (b) Frank Darabont’s The Mist.

Darabont’s third adaptation of a Stephen King story, the film stars Thomas Jane (The Expanse) as a Hollywood poster artist living in Maine who, along with his wife and son and the rest of his neighbors, takes shelter in a supermarket in the wake of a mysterious storm that covers the town in a deadly mist.

Supernatural, otherworldly horrors abound throughout The Mist, but the greatest horror of all is — you guessed it — humanity itself, as seen in the way the townspeople succumb to the temptation to scapegoat those among themselves under the influence of a local religious fanatic. The ending is a gut-punch and sincerely one of the most chilling in any mainstream horror film of its time. If you’ve managed to go unspoiled until now, I won’t ruin the surprise, but needless to say, it’s worth it. —TE

Night of the Living Dead

Director: George A. Romero

Cast: Duane Jones, Judith O’Dea, Marilyn Eastman

Where to watch: Max, Peacock, MGM Plus, Paramount Plus, Roku Channel

The movie that launched the modern zombie film in the United States, George A. Romero’s debut feature was written, directed, photographed, and edited by the nascent zombie film master on a shoestring budget, which only adds to the eerie atmosphere and grounded terror. In this film, a group of survivors hide out in an abandoned house in western Pennsylvania at the start of a zombie apocalypse. Led by the level-headed Ben (Duane Jones), the group not only has to deal with the conflict of zombies trying to break in, but internal conflicts stemming from disagreements on how to handle their precarious predicament.

Night of the Living Dead is the first example of Romero’s typical blend of jaw-dropping (and stomach-churning) practical effects and astute social commentary. Fun fact: This movie came out a month before the MPAA film rating system, which meant a heaping amount of controversy when children were able to see the quite graphic movie in theaters. And another fun fact: Night of the Living Dead was never copyrighted and is in the public domain because of an error by the original theatrical distributor. —PV

Possession

Director: Andrzej Żuławski

Cast: Isabelle Adjani, Sam Neill, Heinz Bennent

Where to watch: Shudder, AMC Plus, Metrograph

Outside of the most ardent of cinephile circles, Andrzej Żuławski isn’t a name that inspires enthusiastic recognition in the United States. Known for his transgressive brand of arthouse cinema, Żuławski’s career was stymied by Communist authorities in his homeland of Poland, with many of his early films being either heavily censored, banned, or, in one instance, nearly destroyed upon release. It also doesn’t help that the few films of his that have been released in the States have since gone out of print — though that appears to be changing soon.

If you do know Żuławski’s name, it’s likely for his 1981 psychological horror film Possession, a film whose cult status among horror connoisseurs has only been amplified in the decades since its release by its difficulty to obtain on physical media or to view online. Fortunately for everyone, that’s no longer the case.

Set in Cold War-era West Berlin, Żuławski’s film stars Jurassic Park’s Sam Neill as Mark, a Russian spy who returns home to find that his wife, Anna (Isabelle Adjani), has left him and wants a divorce. When Anna refuses to divulge why, only saying that she has not left him for someone else, Mark grows suspicious and has her tailed. What he eventually discovers is a horrifying secret beyond his comprehension, one which awakens a long-dormant wellspring of anxiety, resentment, and despair between the two that threatens to tear apart not only their small family, but their very sanity as well.

Inspired by Żuławski’s own tumultuous divorce in 1976 and his subsequent struggles with suicidal ideation, Possession blurs the line between the autobiographical and the phantasmagorical, with hysterical performances by Neill and Adjani that vacillate between disturbing, comical, and disquietingly sympathetic. An inspiration for everything from Ari Aster’s Midsommar to the 2016 music video for Massive Attack’s “Voodoo in My Blood,” Possession is an essential watch for any serious horror fan. —TE

[REC]

Directors: Jaume Balaguero, Paco Plaza

Cast: Manuela Velasco, Ferran Terraza, Martha Carbonell

Where to watch: Prime Video

One of the best and most disturbing found-footage movies ever, [REC] follows a TV reporter and camera person who follow emergency workers into an apartment building, only to discover the dark truth inside: Some of the residents are turning into monsters. Set squarely in the zombie-craze of the mid-2000s, [REC]’s undead creatures owe quite a bit to the raving cannibal infected of 28 Days Later, but the Spanish movie’s flesh-eaters are quite a bit creepier and more disturbed than their predecessors. While many found-footage movies obscure their scariest moments, [REC] uses the format to enhance its creeping dread and drag out the character’s slow careful exploration of the apartment building, ramping the tension up to 11 just in time for the downright terrifying finale. — AG

Sputnik

Director: Egor Abramenko

Cast: Oksana Akinshina, Fedor Bondarchuk, Pyotr Fyodorov

Where to watch: Hulu

If you’re hungry for a great piece of contemporary Russian sci-fi horror (i.e., something not directed by either Andrei Tarkovsky or Yakov Protazanov), then Egor Abramenko’s 2020 directorial debut is just the film you’re looking for.

Set during 1983 at the height of Cold War tensions, Sputnik (which for your information is Russian for “fellow traveler”) centers on Tatyana (Oskana Akinshina), an uncompromising young psychiatrist with a staunch attitude with regard to the ends justifying the means. Tatyana is recruited by the Soviet military to treat Konstantin (Pyotr Fyodorov), a wounded cosmonaut and the lone survivor of a mysterious satellite crash. Only upon arriving at the remote hospital facility housing the patient and interacting with him does Tatyana come to realize the horrifying truth: Konstantin did not in fact return from space alone; rather, his body has now become the unwitting host to an organism unlike anything seen on Earth. Caught between her duty to study the creature and her desire to save Konstantin from further harm, Tatyana must make a hard decision upon which the very survival of all humanity may rest.

What makes Abramenko’s debut so compelling is how it takes the basic premise of the “trolley problem” thought experiment and twists it repeatedly (and successfully) to dramatic emotional effect. Akinshina (The Bourne Supremacy) delivers a convincing and compelling performance as Tatyana, a woman forced to confront and overcome the uncompromising attitude that had once assured her success but now threatens to endanger not only another man’s life, but potentially the lives of everyone on the planet along with her own soul. Fyodorov, for his own part, delivers a sympathetically complex (and on occasion, implicitly sinister) performance as Konstantin, a Russian “hero” torn between his perceived duty to his country and his emotional obligation to a loved one he all but abandoned before embarking on his most recent mission. The creature design in this movie is terrific, as is the cinematography and the film’s score.

Having previously been slated for a world premiere at the 2020 Tribeca Film Festival and subsequently dumped on video-on-demand in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, Sputnik is exactly the kind of horror movie this list was intended to spotlight: a kind of rare gem of intellectually and viscerally stimulating horror that otherwise goes unappreciated if not given the opportunity to shine. —TE

Suspiria

Director: Dario Argento

Cast: Jessica Harper, Stefania Casini, Flavio Bucci

Where to watch: Tubi, Kanopy

One of the best-looking movies of all time with one of the best soundtracks of all time. What’s better than that?

Dario Argento’s Suspiria tells the story of Suzy Bannion, an American dancer who moves to Germany to study at the prestigious Tanz Akademie. It just so happens that the academy is run by witches. As the facade of the school unravels, Suzy’s fellow students slowly start going missing or dropping dead in increasingly bizarre and horrible ways.

While the plot for Suspiria is interesting, what really makes the movie great is how it looks and how it sounds. Everything about the production design, the costumes, and the colors is eccentric in ways no other horror movie has ever matched. Couple all that with the incredible and haunting soundtrack from European rock band Goblin, and Suspiria becomes an unforgettable horror classic that everyone should see at least once. — AG

The Texas Chain Saw Massacre

Director: Tobe Hooper

Cast: Marilyn Burns, Gunnar Hansen, Allen Danziger

Where to watch: Peacock, Shudder, AMC Plus, Tubi, Freevee

Another shoestring production gone huge, Tobe Hooper’s 1974 masterpiece made over $30 million at the box office on a budget of around $140,000. The movie follows a group of friends who find themselves hunted by a family of cannibals in the middle of Texas, and is a chilling, violent fever dream that permanently lodges itself in the minds of those who watch it.

Eight films have followed, including a Netflix version in 2022, but the original stands out as an unhinged encapsulation of pure chaos and terror. At a tight 83 minutes, the original Texas Chain Saw Massacre is well worth the small time investment to catch up on one of the most influential horror movies ever made. —PV

The Thing

Director: John Carpenter

Cast: Kurt Russell, Wilford Brimley, Keith David

Where to watch: Peacock

John Carpenter’s postmodern creature feature takes the idea of alien monsters and makes them simultaneously more recognizable and more gross and unworldly than in any other movie in history. The Thing, the second adaptation of the excellent novella Who Goes There?, remains thrilling, terrifying, and absolutely disgusting more than 40 years after its release.

The Thing follows a group of researchers working at an Antarctic base. Suddenly, a dog from a local Norwegian camp rushes into their base, with Norwegian men hot on its heels, trying to kill it by any means necessary. However, once the American crew takes the dog in and shelters it, they discover it’s an alien that can transform into any living creature, mimicking it perfectly — and that makes every one of them a suspect.

It’s one of the great paranoid thriller premises of all time, but it just so happens to also be filled with gross and fantastic alien gore. There’s nothing quite like The Thing. —AG

The Unfriended movies

Director: Levan “Leo” Gabriadze (Unfriended); Stephen Susco (Unfriended: Dark Web)

Cast: Shelley Hennig, Moses Storm, Renee Olstead (Unfriended); Colin Woodell, Rebecca Rittenhouse, Betty Gabriel (Unfriended: Dark Web)

Where to watch: Criterion Channel (Unfriended); Digital rental/purchase (Both movies)

As many people have learned over the past few years, there aren’t that many things scarier than a video call you can’t leave.

A masterfully contained horror movie that makes full use of its (at the time) groundbreaking gimmick, Unfriended is a tense teen horror movie that takes place entirely on a character’s laptop screen. Definitely watch it on a laptop if you can, and check out the very good sequel Unfriended: Dark Web if you dug this one. —PV

From our list of the best horror movies on Netflix:

Levan Gabriadze’s Unfriended pulls the audiences through the screen — almost literally. Viewed entirely from the perspective of a computer desktop, 2014 supernatural horror film centers around a Skype call between a group of high school students who are joined by an unknown presence known only as “billie227.” What at first appears to be a prank swiftly morphs into something much more horrific, as the mysterious stranger begins to reveal terrifying secrets about each of the friends before killing them off one by one. Unfriended is thoroughly gripping extrapolation of our always-online world, a world where vengeful poltergeists and doxxing exist side by side and no secret or offense goes undiscovered or unpunished. —TE

Us

Director: Jordan Peele

Cast: Lupita Nyong’o, Winston Duke, Elisabeth Moss

Where to watch: Netflix

Jordan Peele’s already a horror master just three movies into his career, but Us probably still doesn’t have the reputation it deserves. His 2019 psychological slasher had the unfortunate fate of following up the cultural phenomenon of Get Out, so it had a hard time breaking through, in the way that sophomore projects often do. But taken on its own terms, Us is a fantastic little horror movie with tons of atmosphere and an underground society’s worth of great scares.

The movie follows the Wilson family, whose vacation is interrupted by the arrival of a group of doppelgängers who match up with each member of the family perfectly. The clones, it turns out, are called Tethered, and where they come from is very complicated. But before any kind of explanation of the Tethered, what we see is a parade of violent attacks, home invasions, and some very tense encounters between Lupita Nyong’o and herself.

Us may not be Peele’s best movie, but it is a fascinating mix of slasher thrills and world- building, supported by a fantastic cast all operating at their A games. While the entire cast is great, Elizabeth Moss is a particular standout for her extremely brief but extraordinarily loathsome role as one of the family’s friends. Her performance gives this movie so much of its weird off-kilter vibe, and leads to some of its most unstintingly and gleefully over-the-top violence. Alongside the terrifying tone, Peele manages to build an entire second world underneath our own, and will give you a very unhealthy fear of what you’re really seeing when you look in the mirror. —AG",The best horror movies you can watch right now,https://www.polygon.com/22725152/best-horror-movies-netflix-amazon-prime-hulu-hbo,Polygon
entertainment,,2023-10-28T09:00:12+00:00,"Pastor Jesse Bradley of Auburn, Washington runs Grace Community Church.

He's ministered to many, many people struggling with a variety of faith dilemmas and issues in their lives.

In this month of October 2023, as Americans grapple with a variety of issues, he addressed the notion of positive thinking — and shared with Fox News Digital what it would ""look like to change your thinking and shift in a new direction.""

WASHINGTON PASTOR, ONCE GRAVELY ILL, SHARES HOW ‘THE POWER OF THE SECOND THOUGHT’ TRANSFORMED HIS LIFE

Said Pastor Bradley, ""Psychologists report that we have in between 6,000 and 60,000 thoughts a day, based on the person and situation. The National Science Foundation shares that up to 80% of our first thoughts are not helpful, even destructive.""

What happens is that ""when life is difficult, we can become flooded with thoughts that are drenched in fear, worry, stress, selfishness, impurity, selfishness and lies. We do not have to believe, harbor or entertain negative first thoughts. We can be proactive by intentionally choosing our second thought.""

It is no accident that the pastor's new book, his second, is called ""The Power of the Second Thought.""

It dives into the power of understanding that the first thoughts we have are not always the best — and that it's wise to take some time and get to the ""second thoughts,"" which can yield greater understanding.

STORYTELLER REVEALS HIS FAITH AT WORK: ‘I REFUSE TO TRY TO SCREW SOMEONE IN THE NAME OF BUSINESS’

Said Bradley to Fox News Digital in emailed comments this week, ""How can we choose a positive attitude and approach during the day? Reject and replace!""

He gave this list of examples:

Replace ""People just slack and gossip at my job"" with ""I will work with all my strength, even when no one is looking""

Said Bradley, ""Johns Hopkins reports that there are links between positive thinking and health. People with a positive outlook are less likely to have a heart attack or cardiovascular event.""

WASHINGTON PASTOR ACKNOWLEDGES THE PAIN OF PUTDOWNS AGAINST THE CHRISTIAN FAITH: ‘ASK GOD FOR COURAGE’

The pastor said he wrote his most recent book, ""The Power of the Second Thought,"" to help people gain habits to strengthen their mental health.

Bradley graduated from Dartmouth College and was playing professional soccer when he became ill — something that took 10 years to fully recover from. He said finding hope during that time was challenging but is how he changes his ""hopeless first thoughts.""

""I didn't have a roadmap for finding hope or the tools to handle the intensity of my loss and pain,"" he said.

He said turning to Jesus for a deeper meaning and learning to not take his ""first thoughts"" for fact was crucial to his overall mental health.

""The Word of God is living and active, bringing strength, courage, wisdom, and protection,"" he said.

""God's thoughts and ways are higher than ours, but when we spend time, each day reading His Word and listening to the voice of the Good Shepherd, we are filled with new thoughts that change the trajectory of our lives.""

Bradley also shared his dos and don'ts of positive thinking.

He said it's not ""denial and pretending that there are no challenges,"" he said.

""Positive thinking is not flattery and frivolous compliments.""

Rather, positive thinking is realistic, full of truth and love — and aligned with heaven and scripture.

""Positive thinking is not self-consumption, self-absorption or selfishness. Positive thinking is not creating unrealistic expectations for other people and putting extra stress on them to be perfect.""

Bradley said, ""Positive thinking is a vital aspect of loving your neighbor, nourishing your mind, discerning between light and darkness, good and evil and right and wrong.""

""Positive thinking leads to taking action and improving situations. Positive thinking brings out the best in the people around you. Positive thinking rejects excuses, takes responsibility, and overcomes setbacks.""

The pastor went on to explain that Jesus brought more positivity than anyone — which is why it's important to keep faith aligned with that practice of positive thinking.

""Jesus exudes a trustworthy positivity that is full of meaning, faithfulness, and transformation,"" he noted.

""God renews our thinking and vision, empowers us to make intentional choices about our focus and perspective and trains us how to win the battle of our minds,"" he added.

entertainment,,2023-12-05T09:00:54+00:00,"In a phone interview with Fox News Digital on Monday, Los Angeles-based actor Jonathan Roumie spoke of his Christian faith, his prayer life and his hope that others may find peace and serenity during this Advent season of 2023 — because ""any opportunity to connect to Jesus is a welcome one,"" he said.

Roumie, perhaps best known for his role as Jesus Christ in ""The Chosen,"" has paired up with Hallow, the No. 1 prayer app in the world, for a special Advent prayer challenge for this holy season of preparation for Christmas. The 25-day prayer challenge began Monday — and as part of the effort, both he and actor Liam Neeson guide people through a variety of prayers, meditations, Bible readings and more.

This is no mere gig, however, for Roumie.

He is a committed Christian and Catholic, with his own personal story of growing closer to God and continuing to do so each day.

HALLOW APP ANNOUNCES COLLABORATION WITH LIAM NEESON FOR NEW ADVENT SERIES THIS YEAR

People can ""disconnect from the chaos of the real world, the divisiveness, the anxiety"" that exists, said Roumie, by connecting with Jesus through prayer.

They can find ""peace and a deeper relationship with Christ, and I think that's really the goal of the prayer challenge,"" he said.

Roumie said that building a habit of prayer ""is easier than people think.""

He added, ""As you consistently tap into that habit, you find your relationship with Jesus growing deeper and deeper, just automatically. And as a result, you then experience much more peace, tranquility and serenity in your life and the ability to really muscle through some of the most difficult obstacles and challenges that life can throw at you,"" he said.

Here is more of Fox News Digital's conversation with Roumie about the 25-day prayer challenge during Advent, which started on Monday — and about Roumie's own faith beliefs.

‘Deep gratitude’

Fox News Digital: In the midst of some of the most trying times today, how do you — and how does anyone — keep a focus on prayer, on God, on a connection with God? It's very, very easy to get distracted in today's world.

Jonathan Roumie: Yes, and I think that for me, I'm very easily distracted — and technology is one of the things that contributes to that distraction.

But in this case, I have such a deep gratitude to the technology that's arrived in the form of this app — of the Hallow app. I can literally go to my phone and if I find myself or my mind wandering — or my anxiety building — all I have to do is literally click on the app and just start praying or meditating on one of the challenges or one of the prayers.

FIRST SUNDAY OF ADVENT IS A REMINDER TO ‘WATCH’ AND PREPARE FOR CHRIST'S SECOND COMING, SAYS FAITH LEADER

There are thousands of prayers on this app. And I'm instantly transported into a sacred space, no matter where I am.

No matter what, if you live in a major city or if you live in a place that's just really busy, you can pop on your headphones and connect to the app. You start praying with a meditation and you're instantly just transported.

This is something that I've been so grateful for — and especially as we go into the hubbub and the busyness of the Christmas season, it's something that I'm relying on daily, to be able to just cut through all that noise.

‘Transformative for people’

Question: Are people reaching out to you about your involvement with the app and asking you more about it?

Roumie: I've had so many people say they've cultivated a relationship with Jesus through prayer because they heard me talk about the app, or because they watched ""The Chosen"" and then they started seeing this pop up in other places.

WHAT IS AN ADVENT AND WHAT DO ITS CANDLES MEAN DURING THIS HOLY SEASON?

And they've gotten introduced to the app and to a more deeply cultivated prayer life — and in some cases it's been absolutely transformative for people.

Some people who've never been to church started going to church. Some people who haven't been to church for 20 years have come back to the church. People have converted — and all because they've fallen in love with the richness, the depth and the tradition of the Catholic Church.

And obviously [the Hallow app] is authentically Catholic, but it is for all Christians — Christians of all denominations. There's something there for everybody, which is what makes the app so universally appealing.

‘Simple act of surrender’

Question: You've described an experience earlier in your life in which you prayed about leaving all of your anxieties and worries aside, and instead trusted that God would take care of things — and then after that came the role of Jesus in ""The Chosen"" for you. Is there a larger message here for people, things that others might learn from your experience?

Roumie: I think it all comes down to the simple act of surrender to God in a person's life. And I went through this in a very visceral, substantial and transformative way in my life five years ago.

I literally was on my knees and I said, ""Jesus, I surrender myself to you. Take care of everything."" And He did.

""It's a matter of tapping into [our] faith and allowing Him to be more involved in our lives — and surrendering is the first step to getting there""

And then three months later, I got called to do ""The Chosen."" It was a point that I think my life was building to when that happened — and I realized that trying to micromanage God was not something that was working in my favor.

'HALLOW' PRAYER APP ACCOMPLISHED ITS GOAL DURING THE GOP DEBATE, COMPANY SAYS: 'PRAY WITH ME REAL QUICK'

And once I let him take the wheel, everything changed. The decisive moment was that simple prayer of surrender.

And I think that's really difficult for people, especially when we feel so out of control. When we turn on the news and see what's going on today, it feels like we have no control in our own lives.

But God hasn't forsaken us. He's not abandoned us. He's faithful to us to the very end. And it's a matter of tapping into that faith and allowing Him to be more involved in our lives — and surrendering is the first step to getting there.

And then, to continue to cultivate that relationship through prayer — that's how we sustain that surrender.

The Hallow app and especially this Advent challenge is a beautiful way to kickstart that, especially if a person hasn't ever tried praying consistently before.

‘So many options’

Question: For those who haven't used it yet, can you describe how the app is not a replacement for Scripture but actually offers robust access to the Bible?

Roumie: I narrate most of the New Testament in the app, so you have access to the Bible here, through many works and passages of Scripture and through [other people] as well.

And if you want something that's very specific, it is here. Plus, there are resources for mental health.

There is music.

And for me as a musician, music is so transportive and nourishing for the spirit — to be able to listen to music that kind of gets you in the mindset for prayer and worship.

There are just so many options that people have that it's kind of mind-bending.

CLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR LIFESTYLE NEWSLETTER

Question: How has playing the role of Jesus in ""The Chosen"" changed your life and changed you?

Roumie: It's allowed me to go deeper into my own relationship with Him.

It's caused me to examine what exactly is my relationship with Him — and how can I go further in that relationship, how can I get close to Him, how can I grow deeper in communion with Him.

So it's challenged me on that level.

But as it challenges me, it also allows me to go further in that relationship — and to deepen my prayer life.",Jonathan Roumie on faith and prayer life during Advent and always: 'God hasn't forsaken us',https://www.foxnews.com/lifestyle/jonathan-roumie-faith-prayer-life-advent-always-god-hasnt-forsaken-us,FOX News - Lifestyle

It may be further afield than the Alps or the Dolomites, but a trip to Canada makes it onto on the bucket lists of ski lovers everywhere for good reason. From the world-famous Whistler Blackcomb and its attractive resort towns to the steep verticals of Revelstoke, there’s enough choice – for every level of skier – to keep you coming back for years.

Families, couples and groups alike can enjoy varied, all-round resorts like charming Tremblant, beginner-friendly family resorts such as Big White and expert areas like Fernie, with some of North America’s steepest terrain, best runs and most challenging off-piste.

Several of the resorts can be combined into one single trip too, offering exceptional variety and thousands of acres in areas of outstanding natural beauty, such as Banff National Park.

Add to this reliable snow cover and some of the longest ski seasons in the world and there’s a compelling case for making your next ski trip to a Canadian resort. Below, we’ve rounded up the best.

Whistler Blackcomb

Undeniably Canada’s most famed ski resort, Whistler Blackcomb has a legendary reputation as an excellent ski area for all levels of skier. The largest ski resort in North America, it is home to over 8,100 acres of skiable terrain and over 200 runs. Some 55 per cent of these are marked as intermediate runs, though there are great beginner areas at the base of Blackcomb and mid-way up Whistler. There are several excellent advanced areas too, including the Flute Bowl, West Bowl and Spankey’s Ladder, with the longest runs offering a 1,500-metre vertical.

The town of Whistler was purpose-built and has quickly developed into one of the world’s premier resorts. There are plenty of non-skiing activities available and several options for kids, while the apres is among some of the best in North America, centred around venues like Merlin’s, Dusty’s and BrewHouse.

Book it

Heidi offers packages to The Westin Resort & Spa, two minutes from the slopes and just over five away from the town centre. Inside, the rooms are spacious, modern and come with excellent views which are only beaten by those offered from the terrace and grill restaurant.

From £3,073pp, including seven nights’ accommodation, room-only, return flights from London Heathrow to Vancouver and airport transfers. Departing 13 January 2024.

Tremblant

Tremblant is Quebec’s premier resort (Getty Images)

Quebec’s premier ski resort sits at the foot of the eponymous mountain, whose pistes cater well to all abilities. Beginners can start their ski journey at the edge of the village before progressing onto a series of long greens, including the Flying Mile. There are a number blues for intermediates, especially in the areas around Le Soleil and the Lowell Thomas lift, while advanced skiers can enjoy several terrain parks and steep black runs on both the north and south side of the mountain.

The idyllic, purpose-built village has been deliberately built in the style of Old Quebec, with plenty of colourful facades and French-Canadian charm. It offers lively apres and nightlife, often bolstered when locals flock in from Montreal. Non-skiing activities include ice skating, ice fishing and long walking trails, plus there’s a village casino.

Book it

British Airways Holidays has trips to the Fairmont Tremblant, one of the more grand hotels in the resort, with an excellent ski-in/ski-out location that lies just a few metres from the lifts. The hotel has impressive spa, pool and sauna facilities, along with a large terrace, restaurant and outdoor hot tub.

From £1,329pp, including seven nights’ accommodation, room-only, return flights from London Heathrow to Montreal and airport transfers. Departing 20 January 2024.

Sunshine Village

Sunshine Village lies around 20 minutes away from the town of Banff, with over 3,000 acres of ski area that is famed for its snow quality and reliable coverage, reflected in its long season that typically runs from mid-November to late May. It is another all-round area that caters almost equally to every level of skier, starting at the greens on the slopes of Mount Standish. Intermediates are at home in the areas served by the Continental Divide lift and the Tee Pee Town Express, while the more advanced should make a beeline for Goats Eye Mountain. The off-piste at Delirium Dive is also noteworthy.

Banff is the place to stay for livelier evenings and decent accessibility, though due to the town’s distance from the ski area, there is less of an ‘apres’ culture on the slopes.

Book it

Stay at the newest hotel in Banff with a package from Inghams. The four-star Moose Hotel & Suites sits in the downtown area, offering comfortable rooms – with balcony or patio areas that provide great views of the Rockies – and a spa that features two heated rooftop pools that remain open in winter. You’ll be a short shuttle away from Sunshine Village, or it’s a 40-minute journey over to neighbouring Lake Louise.

From £1,482pp, including seven nights’ accommodation, room-only, return flights from London Heathrow to Calgary and transfers. Departing 27 January 2024.

Fernie

Though a little smaller than some rivals at 2,500 acres, Fernie has gained a reputation as an excellent area for advanced skiers, with the added bonus of an average of nine metres of snowfall annually. The mountain is divided into seven sections, the lowest of which offers groomed green slopes for beginners, but the real attraction in Fernie is the ungroomed, steep terrain and tree skiing.

The most challenging runs are at Polar Peak and Currie Bowl, with tree skiing at Siberia or Timber Bowl. The runs around the Timber Bowl Express are more open and longer, with a 650-metre vertical.

When picking accommodation, beware that Fernie’s resort village, while convenient, is fairly small and quiet. The town of Fernie itself is far more lively and has good bus links to the resort five miles away.

Book it

Welcome in the New Year in style with a stay in Fernie courtesy of Ski Solutions. Mark the celebrations at Lizard Creek Lodge, a ski-in/ski-out hotel where the views from the terrace and balconies are only rivalled by those on the slopes. Head into town in the evenings in a rental car, included in the package price.

From £1,795pp, including seven nights’ accommodation, room-only, return flights from a London airport, airport transfers and car hire. Departing 30 December 2023.

Big White

Big White offers great tree runs (Getty Images)

Big White is one of the best choices in the country for beginners, intermediates and those looking to learn to ski powder, with less steep terrain and plenty of shelter and tree runs. Located in the Okanagan Highlands, this 2,800-acre resort was purpose built for ski-in/ski-out access, providing easy access to the slopes from most of the accommodation.

Some 18 per cent of its 119 runs designated as beginner, while intermediates have the pick of the slopes, with over 50 per cent catering to them. Though the resort is less advanced-friendly, there are challenging areas out in the open at the top of the mountain.

Marketed as ‘Canada’s favourite family resort’, Big White is also a great destination for a ski holiday with the kids. The ‘Happy Valley’ area at the bottom of the village provides several non-skiing activities, and there are enough good restaurants to fill your stay if needed.

Book it

Ski Safari offers February half-term getaways to Big White with a stay at the aptly named Chateau Big White in the centre of town. Close to the slopes and with convenient ski-in/ski-out access, it has the ideal location for exploring both the pistes and the local area. Guests can sample food at the on-site Swiss Bear restaurant or the Black Diamond Bar & Grill.

Prices for two adults and two children under 12 years from £1,280pp, including seven nights’ accommodation, room-only, return flights and transfers. Flights are arranged and quoted upon enquiry. Departing 10 February 2024.

Lake Louise

Lake Louise lies a little further away from Banff than Sunshine Village, but offers a larger ski area and some of the most amazing views in Banff National Park, including that of the famed Mount Assiniboine. Beginners will find the area around the foot of the hill a good start, while the area around the Grizzly Express and Larch Express lifts contains good beginner runs and some top-to-bottom greens. Much of the rest suits intermediates, while the Back Bowls are good for the more advanced.

Most people will choose to base themselves in Banff, though the 45-minute drive to Lake Louise may put some off. A lift pass to the ‘Ski Big 3’ area covers Lake Louise, Sunshine Village and nearby Mount Norquay, but a stay in Lake Louise itself is a great option for a relaxing week split between skiing, the odd visit to Banff and seeing what this charming village has to offer.

Book it

Another offering from Fairmont is the magnificent Chateau Lake Louise, a historic hotel located right next to the shores of the lake itself. Crystal Ski offers the most affordable package here, with a stay in an elegant double room that boasts delightful views of the Rockies. You’ll be five minutes away from town, with the ski area accessible using a free, 10-minute shuttle bus.

From £1,904pp, including seven nights’ accommodation, room-only, return flights from London Heathrow to Calgary and transfers. Departing 27 January 2024.

Revelstoke

Revelstoke is one of Canada’s newest resorts (Getty Images/iStockphoto)

Revelstoke has managed to gain a glowing reputation despite existing for much less time than most of its rivals (it opened in 2007). Another resort that is well-known for the quality and quantity of its snow, it is still a work in progress – you can currently explore around 3,000 of the intended 8,000 acres – but is already a highly regarded destination for those of an intermediate level or higher.

Mount Mackenzie possesses everything from well-groomed, long blues like the 4km Snow Rodeo to steep open terrain or tree-skiing around the North and South Bowls, with a vertical of 1,700 metres that is the longest on the continent. Heli-skiing is also popular in Revelstoke, opening up access to 500,000 acres and 400 runs.

Book it

Book a stay at The Sutton Place hotel with Ski Safari. A refreshing blend of alpine facades and modern American interiors, it has large suites and impressive facilities including indoor and outdoor pools and three restaurants. Even better, it sits less than 50 metres from one of the main gondolas for easy access to the slopes.

From £2,455pp, including 10 nights’ accommodation, room-only, return flights and airport transfers. Flights are arranged and quoted upon enquiry. Departing 15 January 2024.

entertainment,Cameron Faulkner,2023-11-12T15:00:00+00:00,"The best deals of the year were once known to occur during Black Friday and Cyber Monday, which in 2023 take place on Friday, Nov. 24, and Monday, Nov. 27, respectively. Not anymore!

In 2023, the best Black Friday deals kicked off on Nov. 17 at Amazon, Best Buy, Walmart, and other retailers. Instead of hosting all of the doorbuster deals on one day right after Thanksgiving, retailers see the value in maximizing the amount of time you have to shop for products before Black Friday. And I’ve gotta say, it’s quite nice to not feel rushed while shopping.

In addition to presenting you with the best board game deals and price drops on gaming monitors, plus deals on SSDs and microSD cards, there are some bits of info and wisdom I’ve organized into sections below that might help you feel more informed as you begin to shop for the holidays.

Retailer memberships will pay for themselves (eventually)

To get early access to Black Friday and Cyber Monday deals — or to get access at all — some retailers offer memberships. Most are familiar with Amazon Prime, which offers a free 30-day trial and unlocks special prices on top of free shipping and other perks, but there are others. Costco is another popular example that’s been around for a while. Its $60 membership pays for itself quickly with holiday purchases, especially if you buy food products in bulk (this is outside of Polygon’s purview, but you cannot beat its deal on Kerrygold butter).

Walmart Plus costs $99 per year ($50 for a limited time), and serves as a ticket to get in on deals before other Walmart shoppers, plus other perks. Note: You won’t get early access to deals with its free 30-day trial; you must be a paid member to earn access, so hit “Skip trial for Early Access” when signing up.

Amazon offers freebies for Prime members ’round the calendar year, not just during the holiday months. Those offerings expire over time and new ones are added, and Amazon’s suite of giveaways has improved over time.

We collect all of the latest free games and DLC that Amazon is giving away right here. To give you a taste, Rage 2, Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic, and Doom 3 are some of what’s up for grabs right now.

You’ll get price matching if you shop at the right time

Some major retailers are ensuring price protection on purchases right now.

Amazon does not price match, which is annoying, but it’s tolerable since it often has the lowest prices of all retailers anyway. Amazon only protects the price on pre-orders that have its “Pre-order Price Guarantee,” which ensures that you’ll pay the lowest amount a product sells for before it’s launched.

Not only does Best Buy match prices from “qualified competitors,” but its site says that most products bought between now and Dec. 30 can be price-matched through Jan. 13, 2024.

Walmart’s policy says it won’t price match with competitors, nor does it price match for products purchased online that later decrease in price.

Target says that purchases made between Oct. 22 and Dec. 24 can be price-adjusted if the cost lowers in the span of time, and if you show proof of purchase. You may be eligible for a price match on a purchase, but the rules for submitting documentation vary depending on whether you’re shopping online or in store. It’s all explained here.

Most Black Friday return policies extend through January 2024

According to Best Buy, certain products bought now (dating back to Oct. 27) until Dec. 30 may be returned before Jan. 13.

Target will accept most unopened items in new condition within 90 days of purchase.

Walmart has an extended holiday return policy in effect that allows items purchased between Oct. 1 and Dec. 31 to be returned on or before Jan. 31, 2024.

Amazon’s extended return policy is in effect for most items that are purchased between Nov. 1 and Dec. 31. Those items can be returned before Jan. 31, 2024. However, Apple-brand products purchased in that time frame can only be returned on or before Jan. 15, 2024.

Black Friday likely won’t be your last opportunity to save

There will be amazing deals during Black Friday and Cyber Monday on everything, from tabletop and board games to toys, video games, and more. However, it likely won’t be the last opportunity for you to save. As someone who’s been covering deals for The Verge and Polygon for years, I’m shocked by how often I see these low prices, often spoken of as if they’re a flash in the pan, extending through much of December. That said, it’s more likely that price cuts on products you want can go by unnoticed unless you’re tracking deals yourself.

Track deals yourself

We love to tell you about great deals. But there’s a limit to the kind of products that we write about, and the ones that we see. If you’re not comfortable leaving it up to the chance that we’re going to tell you about price cuts on the products you really want, you have the power to track deals with relative ease.

If you only shop on Amazon, CamelCamelCamel remains one of the best tools for tracking price changes and history for products. While you don’t need an account to see pricing information available through the app, making a profile will allow you to set up watchlists and get email price alerts for your favorite products. You’re welcome to manually populate your own watchlist, but the app also allows you to import any existing Amazon wishlist into your CamelCamelCamel profile. Make sure to grab its Camelizer browser extension, too.

Honey and its accompanying extension allow you to track pricing history changes on specific products, but across a number of retailers, not just Amazon. Also, as an added bonus, Honey will also automatically search for promo codes when you check out at a supported retailer.",How to tackle Black Friday shopping like a boss,https://www.polygon.com/23934751/black-friday-cyber-monday-2023-time-price-matching-returns,Polygon

Got it Normal text size Larger text size Very large text size It all started with a car full of booze and a bear costume. Owen Teale, recently suspended from his sixth-form college for organising a riotous Christmas party for fellow students, was in need of a job. “They held an investigation into the party and I was the first to be called in,” says the 62-year-old Welsh actor best known as gimlet-eyed master-at-arms Ser Alliser Thorne in Game of Thrones. “They’d found the empty bottles and people were falling over drunk. I said, ‘yeah, I did it. It was me. I borrowed my mother’s car, loaded it up with booze and smuggled it in’.” Teale had no intention of joining his father at the limestone quarry that fed the steel works at Port Talbot. He wanted to escape South Wales, to find a bigger world. Which is when fate – or rather a kindly teacher called Mr Davies – intervened. He suggested Teale might find work at Barry Island Pleasure Park, a fairground near Cardiff. “At the time, it was a rust bucket of a big wheel and one big dipper,” recalls Teale. “But I went along and auditioned. I was hoping to be a magician’s assistant or something like that, but they said ‘you’d be great as the bear. Here’s the costume’.” Game of Thrones star Owen Teale will play Scrooge in a Melbourne season of A Christmas Carol. Credit: Jay Brooks The role of Barry the Bear was deceptively hard. “His remit was to wander around the park greeting visitors, but you could only do an hour at a time because you sweated so much. I wore pyjamas under the costume to absorb the sweat, but it would fill the rubber hands. After a while, I’d get bored, sit on the big wheel and go round and round.” The sight of a disconsolate, sweaty bear riding the ferris wheel caught management’s attention and Teale was sacked. At which point a couple of his co-workers – students from the Guildford School of Acting – suggested he audition at their alma mater. He was accepted, awarded a study grant and Barry the Bear got a ticket out of Wales.

“I was going nowhere really. If I hadn’t met those two young women I don’t know what would have happened,” says Teale. “But there have been so many points in my career, moments of pure chance, when things went my way. And if you can survive the moments when things don’t go your way, you can make it.” If you’re not a diehard Game of Thrones fan, Teale’s name may not be familiar. But his pale face, intense eyes and imposing physicality – he’s 188cm in his socks – will be. The Welsh character actor is a Zelig-like figure whose frequent stage and screen appearances invariably guarantee two things: the tale will be well told and bad stuff is going to happen. He’s in Leeds when we speak, visiting his younger daughter Gracie, 21, who’s studying art and design at the city’s university. Eliza, 25, his other daughter with actor wife Sylvestra Le Touzel, is following in her parents’ footsteps. His son, Ion, from his first marriage, recently made him a grandfather. Owen Teale and his wife, Sylvestra Le Touzel, at the sixth-season premiere of Game of Thrones in Hollywood. Credit: Getty Images Loading Earlier today, he was in Edinburgh shooting scenes for the second season of the supernatural TV thriller The Rig. His character Lars Hutton, an irascible bully and the man most likely to be chucked off the oil rig, has somehow made it back for the next instalment of the Amazon Prime drama. Hutton, Thorne and Chief Inspector Philip Osborne, another textbook bully who first appeared in the opening season of the BBC police procedural Line of Duty, are just three of the menacing characters he’s played in recent times. Peter Knox, a villainous sorcerer in A Discovery of Witches, the fantasy TV series based on books by Deborah Harkness, is another.

When he portrays Ebenezer Scrooge in an upcoming Melbourne production of Jack Thorne’s award-winning adaptation of Dickens’ A Christmas Carol, he’ll summon the same forces to make the archetypal miser utterly convincing. The truth is this: the avuncular man in the amber-coloured spectacles and leather jacket chatting to me on the line from Leeds is a master of darkness. When Ser Alliser Thorne drove a dagger into the heart of Game of Thrones’ Byronic hero Jon Snow in the final episode of Season 5, he left the show’s 10 million viewers in a profound state of shock. “It’s true, I have started to play a lot of dark characters,” he says, smiling. “And at first it was a great challenge because I’m quite a sociable fellow.” So, how does he find that darkness? “It’s a sense of nothingness. In all honesty, I’m not very good at being completely on my own,” he explains. “I come alive when I’m with other people. So staying in hotel rooms away from my family isn’t great and it doesn’t get any easier. There’s something empty and a bit scary within me when I’m not with people. I think that’s where that stuff comes from.” Owen Teale unleashes the darkness as Ser Alliser Thorne in Game of Thrones. His ability to tap into the void served him well as he prepared to enact the murder of Snow, played by Kit Harington. “There was Kit … who was so beautiful. And he’s such a lovely man. By connecting to this feeling of emptiness, of having nothing inside of me, I was able to look at him and everything he had - his looks, his grace - and feel pure hatred. For all of Ser Alliser’s explanations [for the murder], deep down he just has a hatred of Jon Snow’s popularity and gifts.” Like Iago, I suggest. “Yes,” he says. “Very like Iago.”

When Snow’s death was broadcast, Teale braced himself for the fall-out. He imagined being confronted by irate Game of Thrones fans who would hate him for “killing the goodness”. Instead, he was asked for endless selfies and impromptu recitations of Thorne catchphrases such as “For the Watch!” or “Bas-terd!” Once, a drunk emerged from a restaurant and stumbled towards Teale brandishing a knife. The actor braced himself, but the man simply wanted “Ser Alliser” to hold the utensil to his throat for a photo. On a visit to Uluru with his family, the tour guide caught sight of his face and exclaimed, “what are you doing here?” Says Teale, “He just kept staring at me and I realised it was an Alliser Thorne thing. I said, ‘I’m not going to kill anyone, I’m just an actor’. But it clearly troubled him that this person who had committed this awful crime had suddenly appeared.” Teale has the grace to admit he enjoys this new level of celebrity. “People seem to realise that without the darkness of people like Ser Alliser, Jon Snow couldn’t have shone as brightly as he did.” Owen Teale with Clare Homan in The Fifteen Streets. Credit: ABC He was well into his 50s when he landed his highest profile role, but it would be wrong to think of Teale as a late starter. In 1989, not long out of drama school, he starred in the hit television adaptation of Catherine Cookson’s romance The Fifteen Streets. The cast included Sean Bean, another young working-class actor, who went on to become a leading man in Hollywood before playing Ned Stark in Game of Thrones. I ask Teale if he ever wishes he’d followed Bean’s trajectory. “Oh god, yeah,” he replies. “Absolutely. You instinctively think [playing leading men] will lead to feelings of success. But it never came my way. My cut of my jib wasn’t quite right. It’s about what your face does on screen I guess.”

There have been opportunities to step into the spotlight over the years. When The Fifteen Streets attracted a massive TV audience in Britain, Teale was offered a lead role in a movie playing a bare knuckle fighter. But the financing fell through and he signed up for a four-year stint with the Royal Shakespeare Company instead. Years later, a producer offered him the lead in a big film being shot in Britain, but the money men demanded an American star and William Hurt got the gig. When Teale won a Tony Award in 1997 for his performance in Ibsen’s A Doll’s House, he was told he needed to spend time in Hollywood wooing producers. He decided to fly home to his family in London instead. “My wife was about to give birth, so I said ‘I’m off’. I’m sure part of it was I just didn’t believe that I was going to waltz into leading man roles in Hollywood.” And there it is, that ambivalence. Despite all the plaudits, the awards and the steady offers of work, you sense Teale has never been certain of his gifts. It’s probably why he’s so consistently good – complacency isn’t in his nature. Owen Teale with Toni Collette in Dream Horse: “Toni just raised my game,” he says. Credit: AP He’s far better at recognising brilliance in others. For example, Toni Collette, who he worked with on Dream Horse, a 2020 movie about an unlikely champion racehorse. “Toni just raised my game. That’s a huge talent, huge,” he says, shaking his head in wonder. “I recently received an award from BAFTA for the film and part of me thinks they should give it to Toni.” He’s happiest in a room full of actors working on a play, a film or a TV production. “What turns me on is the thought of collaborating with talented people. I’m very sociable with the rest of the company and fully intend to do that when I come to Melbourne.”

entertainment,Barry Divola,2023-11-30T18:30:00+00:00,"Tate McRae’s career, until recently, had a stench of desperation about it. That’s a wild thing to say about someone who’s only 20, but how else to describe the feeling you get watching an artist who trades explicitly in classic pop moves failing to grab the mode such musical expression necessitates, ie: popularity? Tate McRae’s Think Later: a second stab at superstardom. Despite her age, the Calgary-born musician’s already had a journey. A professionally trained dancer since 6, at 13 she finished third on the US version of So You Think You Can Dance and attracted record label attention with songs uploaded to YouTube. In 2020, her weeper You Broke Me First had a chart moment, leading to her debut I Used To Think I Can Fly in 2022, an intriguing album of thrashy bangers and post-Billie Eilish sad-pop featuring production from pop titans Greg Kurstin (Adele) and Finneas (Eilish). It had at least one could’ve been smash – the spiky What Would You Do? – but, fairly listless despite her swaggering delivery, it failed to ignite with either mainstream audiences or pop aesthetes. But then, this past August, Greedy happened. Used in a video by popular TikToker Tube Girl and then in countless hair-flip transition clips, the song went viral, eventually amassing over 320 million streams globally, topping charts internationally, and becoming McRae’s proper breakthrough and a rare reintroduction. It even landed her a slot on Saturday Night Live, that pop superstar rite-of-passage, and sold out shows for her upcoming Australian tour next November. That Greedy’s the thing that’s pushed McRae to the next level is somewhat confounding. Is it even a good song? It’s not particularly memorable, and McRae’s debut had better tracks that slipped listeners by. But its sassy sentiment – “I would want myself”, particularly suited to clips of youthful coming-of-age expression – clearly caught on with the TikTok crowd, which is how pop stardom happens these days. In another popstar move, McRae also channelled an alter ego (Tatiana, who’s “ballsy, loud and obnoxious”) for Greedy’s vibrant music video, a fun throwback to choreographed Y2K-era aesthetics – McRae dancing all lustily on a Zamboni (so Canadian) – which surely helped.

In this context comes Think Later, McRae’s sophomore release. Almost completely produced and co-written with Ryan Tedder (OneRepublic), it sports his hit-making trademarks, for better or worse – pristine songcraft hooked around off-kilter concepts that can’t help but catch the ear, but punishingly midtempo, songs searching for gravitas over, say, fun. For an album that’s supposed to be McRae’s bold, confident, cheeky makeover, parts of it lack spark. Tellingly, the best songs on the album – Exes, Hurt My Feelings and Guilty Conscience – follow the Greedy template: skittering Timbaland-style beats recalling Y2K-era pop, all syncopated and staccato and sultry kiss-offs to dumb boys. They feel strong and personally nostalgic – like McRae’s nodding to her countrywoman Nelly Furtado’s classic mid-’00s run – but driven by McRae’s playfulness. We’re Not Alike shows another promising side to McRae’s sound, a post-punky thing built on an Interpol-ish riff that slyly builds into something anthemic, recalling her pal Olivia Rodrigo’s sleeper Guts track, Pretty Isn’t Pretty (the post-punk revival has officially returned to pop, it seems). That these songs are so interesting makes the album’s overemphasis on understated ballads frustrating. Songs like opener Cut My Hair, Grave and Stay Done are slick but dour affairs, the classic Tedder formula. Messier, which weirdly is not another Canadian nod to ice hockey great Mark, shows McRae has the range, a bitter ballad where she allows her vocals to get raw and unhinged.

But the real pleasure of Think Later lies in McRae’s idiosyncrasies and their potential; she’s a throwback in the classic singing-dancing Britney mould. With a pop landscape led by serious singer-songwriters like Taylor Swift, SZA, Rodrigo and Eilish; Dua “go girl, give us nothing” Lipa; the fame-trolling Doja Cat; and the introverted to the point of obscurity PinkPantheress, there’s a vacancy for McRae’s particular set of popstar skills. If she’s greedy enough, the platform feels like it’s hers to grab. Robert Moran I/O, Peter Gabriel For a guy who spent much of the ’70s at the forefront of prog-rock as the singer for Genesis, creating sprawling concept albums, wearing a series of increasingly bizarre stage outfits that suggested he had ingested a truckload of acid on the way to a Halloween party, and being one of the main reasons punk had to happen, Peter Gabriel sure did go on to personify big, shiny ’80s pop. The most played video on MTV? That would be Sledgehammer, his body slam of a hit from 1986 that did just what it said on the tin. The song blaring from that boombox John Cusack held aloft under Ione Skye’s window in the iconic scene from 1989’s Say Anything? That would be Gabriel’s In Your Eyes. And, somewhat bizarrely, you can barely watch an old episode of Miami Vice without hearing a Gabriel song in the background. After two decades, Peter Gabriel returns – overcooked and overlong.

From popularising the massive, heavily gated drum sound that dominated the era to becoming one of world music’s greatest champions by co-founding the WOMAD festival, for a while there Gabriel was seemingly everywhere. And then… he wasn’t. In fact, I/O is his first solo album of new original material in over two decades. Some wags are calling it his Chinese Democracy, but the rarely punctual Axl Rose only took a comparatively brisk 18 years to finally release the follow-up to Use Your Illusion. Some things haven’t changed. From the get-go, on opening track Panopticom, there’s that gunshots-in-an-echo-chamber drum sound and the instantly recognisable fat, slithering tones of long-time bassist Tony Levin. And the subject matter is the familiar, big-world thinking we’ve come to expect, too – in this case, Gabriel’s utopian idea of an infinitely expandable and accessible world database, but, you know, one that doesn’t peddle untruths. The title track could almost come from Coldplay, with its singalong chorus designed for arena crowds waving lit-up smartphones, while Gabriel sings “stuff coming out, stuff going in, I’m just a part of everything”.

In the late ’90s, Gabriel collaborated with Randy Newman on That’ll Do from the Babe soundtrack. Should Newman be indisposed for the next Pixar film soundtrack, Gabriel’s Playing For Time could easily slot in for that reflective, tear-inducing, life-affirming ballad Newman routinely provides for the end of the second act. In fact, there’s a palpable sense of mortality on I/O. Gabriel is 73, and he’s mining a seam of material here about taking stock, feeling at one with the world and the (admittedly, not exactly original) realisation that love is all we need. This reaches its most intense moment in And Still, a song he wrote to deal with the death of his mother in 2016. It’s a fragile, delicate thing that has an almost Nick Drake transparency to it, as he remembers leaning his head against her skin and the feeling of her brushing his hair as a young boy. But with all that time spent cooking up these songs, some have been left in the oven too long, stretching to five, six, seven minutes, and in need of an edit or at least a change in tempo. Olive Tree and Live and Let Live overload the “one with the world” barrow he’s pushing – the former, a Sting-like concoction that seems to be two different songs bolted together; the latter, coming from a fine place (inspired by Nelson Mandela and The Elders project) but littered with cliches such as “When we can forgive, we can move on” and “An eye for an eye, again and again, until the whole world is blind”. On top of all this, there are two mixes of the album, one a “bright-side mix” by Mark “Spike” Stent, and the other a “dark-side mix” by Tchad Blake. Yes, it’s a lot to take in. But then, it’s been a while in the making. And who knows when, or if, we’ll get a follow-up?

David Marr, Black Inc., $32.99. October 3 How would you feel if, while doing a bit of genealogical research, you discovered that you were descended from professional killers of Aboriginal people? If you’re someone such as David Marr, who has “been writing about the politics of race all my life. I know what side I’m on”, it prompts this confronting investigation of the Native Police and his family connections through his great-great-grandfather. He describes it as “an act of atonement, of penance by storytelling”. It’s a timely, vital story.

Unfinished Woman

Robyn Davidson, Bloomsbury, $34.99. October 3 You’ve read the book, you’ve seen the film – Tracks – but here is the story of Robyn Davidson’s life from childhood, largely avoiding that trip across the desert with her camels, and beyond to a life of more travel, houses, lovers and family. Particularly family, and particularly her mother, who took her own life at 46 and about whom Davidson has been unable previously to write to her own satisfaction. She is acutely aware that her version of the truth “can bury another’s”, but this one is hers.

Stone Yard Devotional

Charlotte Wood, Allen & Unwin, $32.99. October 3 Another reckoning with a mother’s death, this time in a novel from the sure hands of Charlotte Wood. A woman arrives at some sort of religious community having turned her back on her husband, their life and the metropolis. What is she fleeing and what are her demons? It’s not all peace and tranquillity in the community, which has collective crises to deal with, while her previous life won’t leave her alone. Written in a spare prose, the consistently brilliant Wood delivers yet again. Will Murdoch help Trump again? Credit: The New York Times

The Fall: The End of the Murdoch Empire

Michael Wolff, The Bridge Street Press, $34.99. Out now One thing you can be sure of in a Michael Wolff book is plenty of controversial detail and quotes that are not always fully substantiated and sourced. The American writer has tackled the Donald Trump White House in three books, and now turns his attention back to Rupert Murdoch, about whom he has already written a couple. In this latest volume, he turns his blowtorch on Fox News and the recently retired Murdoch, two players who had massive roles in getting Trump into power. Next year? Surely not.

My Life as a Jew

Michael Gawenda, Scribe, $35. October 3 The former Age editor-in-chief, a left-wing secular Jew, has written a powerful, moving and personal exploration of his roots and the meaning of his life in Australia today – “the Jew I was, the Jew I am, and the Jew I am becoming”. It begins with a frank account of why he ended his long friendship with former publisher Louise Adler over an essay she commissioned about the so-called Israel Lobby, and a public letter about coverage of Israel. But there is much more – memoir, history and literature – in this brave book. Laura Jean McKay has written a new book of short stories. Credit: Brendan Lodge

Gunflower: Stories

Laura Jean McKay, Scribe, $29.99. October 3 Laura Jean McKay won the richest writing prize in the country during the pandemic for her timely novel The Animals in that Country about a virulent virus that allowed infected people to understand what animals were saying. She was quickly called prescient, but whether that label sticks in her return to the short story remains to be seen. This collection, written over 20 years, again features plenty of animal life in stories ranging in length from one page to 20. If you haven’t read her, now’s the time to start. Going Infinite: The Rise and Fall of a New Tycoon

Michael Lewis, Allen Lane, $55. October 3 This is the astonishing story of Sam Bankman-Fried, the young man who set up his cryptocurrency exchange, FTX, in 2019 and three years later was rolling in money.

But when the crypto world went pear-shaped, Bankman-Fried’s business hit an irreversible tailspin, and now he’s facing multiple charges and due in court on October 3. If anyone can be relied on to tell this story of a financial Icarus with verve and narrative flair, it’s Michael Lewis, author of Liar’s Poker, Moneyball, and The Big Short. No doubt the updated edition will have the verdict on SBF. The Woman in Me

Britney Spears, Simon & Schuster, $49.99. October 25 The huge-selling American singer has negotiated the slings and arrows of outrageous fortune in her 41 years, but at the heart of this book – said to have earned her a $US15 million ($23.3 million) advance – is the controversial “conservatorship” by which her father and others were given almost complete control of her life, but still failed to stop it going off the rails many times.

Sure to be a bestseller, the book is described as a candid account of her life – exactly what her fans want. Mr Einstein’s Secretary

Matthew Reilly, Macmillan, $44.99. October 17 Hannah Fischer lived her early life in Berlin, and her next door neighbour was Albert Einstein – he seems to be having a popular culture moment. She idolised him, and she loved physics. But events intervene and the studious Hannah is forced out of Germany to a new, secretarial life in the US. But this is a Matthew Reilly novel – he’s a film director now as well – and Hannah becomes some sort of spy and action hero, getting involved with all the major events and players of the years between the end of World War I and II – prohibition, gangsters, Nazis, and more. It’s a lot of crash-bang-wallop fun and Reilly fans will love it.

The Seven

Chris Hammer, Allen & Unwin, $32.99. October 3 It’s hard to believe that Scrublands, Chris Hammer’s first crime novel, was published only five years ago. Since then, the former journo has followed the crime writer’s timetable of a book a year. His latest brings back Nell Buchanan and Ivan Lucie, whom we met in Treasure & Dirt and Tilt, for a case of murder involving one of the seven families who rule the Yuwonderie district like a fiefdom. You can expect dark secrets to emerge and herrings to be red.

entertainment,Susana Polo,2023-09-26T17:35:00+00:00,"Whatever happened to CollegeHumor? Fans of the Dropout streaming service will tell you at the drop of a hat: The creatives behind it announced a new subscription service in late 2018, made a few ambitious seasons of comedy and live-play Dungeons & Dragons — and then got walloped when their corporate owner, IAC, stopped funding CH Media, resulting in layoffs of nearly the entire staff in January 2020 (which was a totally chill month to lose your job, with absolutely no major upheavals in television production on the horizon).

But CollegeHumor didn’t drop off: IAC sold the brand to executive producer Sam Reich, allowing shows like Dimension 20, Um, Actually, and Game Changer to keep doing the work, and spinning off their most successful formats on Dropout. On Dropout’s fifth anniversary this week, CollegeHumor is “the most healthy and sustainable [it’s] ever been as a company,” says Dimension 20 host Brennan Lee Mulligan. And for Dropout’s anniversary, Reich announced in a new video, the company will cease to be CollegeHumor at all.

Polygon sat down with Reich and Mulligan for the occasion of Dropout’s fifth anniversary to chat about upcoming shows, how a YouTube video brand successfully pivoted to the subscription streaming model, and the big birthday announcement itself: CollegeHumor is no more.

Polygon: Before we dig into the big news, I want to start with another recent announcement you’ve made: The next season of Dimension 20. Brennan, I know this is Aabria Iyengar’s game, but you’re playing in it, and she’s not here and you are. So: Why stoats?

Brennan Lee Mulligan: Why stoats?! They’re a marvelous animal. Burrow’s End is a really fun season of Dimension 20. And I say fun because Aabria’s taking us to this wonderful Secret of NIMH, Watership Down — there’s a certain subgenre. And we find in Dimension 20 that we have our most success when we get specific. It’s not just fantasy, it’s Game of Thrones meets Candyland. It’s not just a mystery, it’s noir, or it’s Agatha Christie — which is actually two of the Side Quest seasons we’ve done, one of which Sam was a player in. It’s about getting specific with the comparisons that you’re reaching out to and where you’re drawing inspiration from.

“Cute little critters” is a quite broad, fantastical storytelling genre — within that there’s a subgenre of perhaps the darkest and most grim stories ever told. You know, I guess there’s adult literature that’s as haunting as Watership Down, but something about the juxtaposition of the cute little bunnies, and a story about death, displacement, horror... Lovecraft wishes that he could have the eldritch horror of rabbits trying to describe a road and the cars that drive on it.

Sam Reich: We want to take our audience and expose them to deep trauma. [laughs] And the way that you do that is by luring them into a sense of comfort and security.

Mulligan: The mental mathematics of the season are also a fun thing. The fact that we go like, Hey, it’s tough being a little furry critter, the woods are dangerous. You know, we see nature documentaries where little stoats and bunnies are getting absolutely eviscerated by falcons and stuff, and you watch it and you’re like, Tough break, buddy, and you move on with your day. But we’ve given them names and voices. And now we’ll see! Now we’ll see how glib they are!

Reich: David Attenborough couldn’t do this!

Sam, that reminds me of something you said to NPR earlier this year, about how you found success with Dropout in, instead of going broad for the viral video, going for “something that feels special to a small group of people.” Has five years of Dropout inspired any advice for creators, or producers, or fans — basically anyone who’s looking to get away from algorithmically powered viral demand, to other platform structures?

Reich: My advice is find a better business model. I think we live in an era of online content right now that is being defined and shaped by algorithms. And that’s true no matter the platform. I think different platforms are shaping content in different ways, and that’s kind of exciting as a creator. Like, Which of these sports am I most excited to play? Lately, TikTok has been prioritizing videos that are longer than a minute, because they’re trying to encourage watch time, while YouTube Shorts still doesn’t allow you to put up anything that’s longer than a minute. So, platforms compete with each other and themselves, and they yield these kind of Frankenstein products. And even in the midst of all of that I am regularly inspired by a lot of the stuff I see on there. I love hanging out on these platforms. I think some of these creators are getting really, really creative.

But I think what the experience of doing Dropout has taught us — and what I would tell others — is for you to make this sustainable you need to have something to offer that’s off of those platforms. There’s lots of ways to do that. One of them is to create a subscription offering like on Patreon and try to drive people to it. Another is to try to leverage your online presence into opportunities in traditional Hollywood. Some folks who aren’t content creators first and foremost are using it as a creative way to market their music or market their physical products, and that’s working out well for those folks.

I think for us, the heart and the soul of what we do is on on Dropout. We are very lucky, very lucky, that social media has turned out to be such a good way for us to market this platform. And we are also gleefully no longer beholden to it.

The story of Dropout’s history recounted in your anniversary video is that you kicked off, and you were raring to go, and then immediately got kneecapped by a corporate sale and a global pandemic, and then you succeeded anyway. If there hadn’t been those hurdles, there would have been other hurdles. I’m sure you ran into other things that surprised you about transforming from CollegeHumor to Dropout. What were the hurdles we don’t hear about because getting dumped by your parent company and the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic overshadow them?

Mulligan: Susana, every day I awaken and am hurled Wallace and Gromit-style out of my bed into another day of making content and telling stories and doing the stuff we get to do at Dropout. Being asked what our strategy was — I think Sam is much better, writ large, at top-down, bird’s-eye strategic oversight than I am.

Reich: Zooming out is what you’re saying, I’m good at zooming out?

Mulligan: You’re great at zooming out. Asking me what our strategy was is sort of like — Susana, you’ve pulled up alongside a man sprinting from a bear, and are like, What was the thought process behind going left at that tree back there? And I’m like [unintelligible gasps]. That’s the headspace that I operate from. But to address the hurdles that you were talking about in terms of what lessons can be drawn, or what do we think would have happened had those obstacles not been there? If those obstacles had not been there, well, my god, I would love for those obstacles not to have been there, I would definitely press that button. Mostly to have prevented COVID, which would be a great boon to the world and global civilization—

Reich: See, I feel like you nailed it, Brennan. The big one I was going to point to is that this is relentless. Not in a bad way — like, we spent our lives as entertainers starving, and then at some point, we arrive at the all-you-can-eat buffet — that’s like when we’ve really made it — and we go, My god, I’m gonna have to eat so much, forever. [laughs] Adam Conover, who is one of my dear, dear friends and also remains pretty mixed about digital versus traditional entertainment, he’s not sure where he wants to fall in terms of those those relative opportunities. He’s like, The thing about digital is you create for yourself a jail, and then you have to live in that jail forever, because your audience wants that from you, again and again and again. Whereas in traditional media, you have a certain amount of seasons, and maybe you get canceled, then you move on to something else.

I think Brennan and I both are in jail right now. The way in which we’re lucky is we both jailed ourselves inside anthology series.

Mulligan: Yeah.

Reich: So, thank god for that bit of (it turns out) foresight, happy accident — which is we get to strut our stuff in lots of different ways despite the fact that we’re beholden to these shows, which, so long as Dropout continues to be successful, will never be canceled? Because...?

Mulligan: Yeah, “no gods no masters” is a pretty exciting place to have found that [success]. And to Sam’s point too, yeah, every time that I go, Woof, we make a lot of this show, I turn around and see the ghost of my absolutely starving 25-year-old self being like, [sarcastically] Oh, you got big problems, huh? Ohhh, big guy got big problems! Wow! [villainously] I’ll kill you. And then I go, Ah, yes, back to it.

Reich: Yeah, I watch myself performing at the New York Renaissance faire. And let me just say, those are a bunch of incredibly fierce and talented performers.

I was there last summer. It’s a good time!

Reich: Incredibly talented, comedic improvisers, so good at thinking on their feet. Those long days, on your feet all day—

Mulligan: Just hoping to get a callback — hoping to get a callback for the Orbit gum activation in Times Square, where me and 20 other improvisers will be paid $100 to receive 10 hours of abuse from real strangers on the street.

Reich: Dude, I did a month of background work on Third Watch, which was like the worst Law & Order.

Mulligan: I was a camera PA on Criminal Intent, which was the actual worst Law & Order! And it wasn’t even during the Vincent D’Onofrio episodes.

Reich: Oh my god. Didn’t even have the pleasure of watching Vincent work.

Going back to your big anniversary announcement, I think a lot of folks will think, Oh, wow! Dropout’s got a big anniversary announcement, is it going to be a new series? New content? Guest stars? and I can see a name change puzzling people. You give a great explanation in the announcement video, but in pure layman’s terms, is this a big deal? I feel like a lot of your fans already know you guys as Dropout.

Reich: Yeah, we told ourselves we would do this when it felt most natural to do it. So in a way, it’s not a big deal at all. And I think a piece of that, to your point, Susana, is intentional. More people who are active fans think of us as Dropout than CollegeHumor now, and this message is almost for everyone else. We do, in the back half of the video, race through a ton of new show announcements.

Don’t think I was going to ignore that, Sam!

Mulligan: I would say too, to Sam’s point, I think internally, we’re just “us.” We’re a comedy company and we have enough glibness and irreverence to have a healthy sense of humor about something like a brand change, internally as a company. We’re like, Yes, this is something that of course we’re having fun with, and I think you can see the, like, tongue-in-cheek-ness in the video itself, which is super fun, but also very earnest celebration of all the amazing work that everybody that works on the platform has done.

I would say, Susana, the obviousness of it is a testament to how tapped in you are. People that are very close to us feel in on the joke, people that are very close to us are like, Of course, I’ve known that CollegeHumor was doing Dropout — I was there in 2018 when the thing launched. But I guarantee you every 18 months, some video creator will be like [in a salacious YouTube thumbnail voice] “What happened to CollegeHumor?” and the first 100 comments will be “They’re the most healthy and sustainable they’ve ever been as a company. What are you talking about?” But that video will still go viral.

So there’s a huge track of the mainstream that I think this actually is worth having an internal, well-made, funny statement about. Because it’s definitely saturated our fan base, but my god, every time you go out — there’s even a joke in the video about how your dad will still call us CollegeHumor. That’s kind of an element of what’s being spoken to.

Reich: The truth is — and we don’t go into this at length in the video — we wanted to make the video even before we recognized that we were going to do the name change. We thought five years would be a good opportunity for us to do a little callback to our original announcement video, a kind of update. But we’ve been wanting to do away with the name CollegeHumor almost since Dropout was first formed.

The name was “Dropout” — as opposed to “CollegeHumor Plus,” or “Pro” or whatever else it could have been — specifically because we were itching to distance ourselves from that brand name. It’s been a blessing and a curse for a long time, the blessing being one of the few brands with quote-unquote “staying power” on the internet, so it has recognizability with a few different generations. And the curse being... pretty self-explanatory. We could not be more distant from our frat-y roots at this point.

You got Whose Line Is It Anyway?’s Wayne Brady on Make Some Noise this season, and in a Tumblr post you said he told you, “There are only two people doing taped improv correctly: us and you.” If I said that Dropout is a notable part of the history of improv performance, both in shows like Make Some Noise and Game Changer — and Dimension 20, that is improvised performance — does that activate your impostor syndrome, or is that something that’s been on your dream board for five years?

Reich: Every waking moment of my day activates my impostor syndrome. But at the same time, I love that sentiment. And I think some of that’s been a happy accident. We set out with a lot of scripted content on Dropout, and it didn’t really work. It’s once we broke away from IAC that we started to do more unscripted stuff, simply because it was what was working on the platform. And I think it’s allowed us really to explore the world of improv more than we ever thought we would get to. And Brennan I knew as a world-class improviser and comedic performer even before I knew he was a GM.

Brennan just shot something for us as a part of a new show, that’s an improv-based show, that’s one of my favorite things I’ve ever seen him do.

Mulligan: Aw, thanks, man. That’s very kind.

Reich: And Brennan’s been through [Upright Citizens Brigade], and I’ve been through UCB, and so many of us have had this training. But Hollywood told us for years and years that there was no great way to capture this on film. And here we are. It’s kind of serendipitous and magical.

Mulligan: Yeah. It’s very special. The impostor syndrome is very real, but I find myself bouncing back and forth between the feeling of — When Wayne Brady says something like that, you sort of can’t accept something that nice. So you deflect it away. But also, I feel like there’s something that would be too glib and dismissive to not be cognizant about the incredible fortune that we’ve had.

If you have a sober eye and look around at the entertainment landscape at other places that are able to celebrate improv and celebrate spontaneous comedy, whether on Game Changer or Make Some Noise and things that push the envelope and play with the form — or even, one of my favorite things to do with Dimension 20 is taking improv comedians, who their entire creative life has been around following game, comedic beats, very in that UCB sketch structure, and let them open their narrative wings and really dip into storytelling in a way they often don’t get an opportunity to do on stage. So on the one hand, yes, very much impostor syndrome, and Oh, something that nice can’t be true. And then on the other hand, I do recognize the rare air we are breathing with having a space like this, so that’s really wonderful.

I wasn’t completely certain that you’d slipped some stealth reveals into the announcement video, but I figured it was pretty likely. Which of them are you most looking forward to? Or, do you have a favorite Easter egg snuck into the video?

Reich: OK, the one that Brennan did the episode of recently that I was wild about is a show we’re calling Very Important People. And it’s a reboot of something we did 12 or 13 years ago on CollegeHumor.

Mulligan: One of my favorite CollegeHumor things of all time when I was a fan at home watching CollegeHumor.

Reich: [And it was] called Hello My Name Is. And the format was that we would put, specifically Josh Ruben, in really ambitious makeup, and we would sit him down for a Charlie Rose-style interview in that character, which he would have only a minute to create. We rebooted that as Very Important People. Vic Michaelis is hosting, and the cast is this rotating cast of characters from our improv world and it’s so... Every once in a while I get what I call the “quality chills”? I got quality chills while I was watching the Dungeons and Drag Queens shoot; this creepy-crawly sensation on your back like, This is really good. Because this is really good. A lot of quality chills.

Mulligan: Hell yeah.

Brennan, do you have a favorite Easter egg from the video?

Reich: There are three seasons of Dimension 20 in that lineup of quick titles...

Mulligan: Do I have a favorite Easter egg? All I’m gonna say is this: The bag of chips I eat in the video was a real bag of chips, and I really ate the whole bag by myself. So when you see me finish the bag on camera, I housed that whole bag of chips. And I don’t want anyone to say that’s movie magic. I don’t want anyone to say that that was fake. That was an entire bag of Cool Ranch Doritos hidden in a Chompsky’s bag that the art department made, and I put that whole thing to bed. I don’t ask for much, but I’m gonna good and goddamn get my credit: I ate the whole bag of chips, OK?

Reich: This is not an endorsement. The Chompsky’s company does not confirm or deny that Chompsky’s chips are in fact Cool Ranch Doritos.",Dropout’s dropping CollegeHumor on its 5th anniversary — here’s why and what the future holds,https://www.polygon.com/23889773/dropout-anniversary-collegehumor-brennan-lee-mulligan-sam-reich,Polygon
entertainment,Matt Patches,2023-10-13T16:30:00+00:00,"The last person in the world who thought Danny Elfman would play Coachella was Danny Elfman.

But in 2022, the legendary composer behind projects like Batman, Spider-Man, The Simpsons, and countless Tim Burton films took the desert stage, shirtless and ready to rip. Those who witnessed the spectacle of Elfman’s performance were blown away — “Nobody else even came close to bringing that level of chaotic pageantry,” wrote Vulture at the time — while images of the roaring composer were quick to go viral on social media.

Most movie buffs knew Elfman as Burton’s bespectacled, goth-adjacent music pal.

Then, in 2022, most movie buffs did a double take. Wow, yes, that’s frickin’ Danny Elfman.

Elfman’s rock turn may not have surprised those who were clicked into the alternative scene of the late 1970s and ’80s; before he established his macabre staccato identity in Burton’s Pee-wee’s Big Adventure, Beetlejuice, and Edward Scissorhands, Elfman was a member of new wave band Oingo Boingo, which hit its hardest with the 1985 single “Weird Science” (featured in the film of the same name). Founded by Danny’s brother Richard, the band steadily toured and cut records through the early ’90s. (In fact, members of the band still tour to this day.) When Elfman left the band to pivot to composing, he also left behind his live music career — for so long that many of his younger superhero-movie-watching/Hot Topic-shopping devotees never knew his lineage. And even in the Oingo Boingo days, the musician wasn’t going as hard as he did at Coachella.

So what brought him back? What rebirthed him as a man who could share a stage with Billie Eilish and Limp Bizkit’s Wes Borland? To my mind, it’s Henry Selick’s The Nightmare Before Christmas. Produced by Burton, the stop-motion project was a black sheep for Walt Disney Animation that blossomed into a cult favorite, and based on the last few years in Elfman’s life, a transformative milestone for a musician born to shred on a stage like no other rocker ever has.

Elfman joined Burton early on in the development of The Nightmare Before Christmas, plussing up the loose animation pitch into a musical worthy of the Disney Renaissance. And after recording demos for Jack Skellington’s big numbers, Elfman became the obvious pick to record the final versions (while The Princess Bride’s Chris Sarandon was hired to match Elfman’s baritone vocals in the spoken dialogue). The rest is history: Elfman went on to win awards for his Nightmare work, and the soundtrack became a cross-holiday staple every October through December.

Elfman did not peak with Nightmare in 1993. His four Oscar nominations for Good Will Hunting, Men in Black, Big Fish, and Milk were all awarded in the years that followed, and his work has extended far beyond film over the decades. In 2005, he premiered the highly baroque Serenada Schizophrana, his first work composed specifically for concert orchestra. In 2008, he wrote the music for the American Ballet Theatre’s Rabbit and Rogue ballet and in 2011 composed for Cirque Du Soleil’s $100 million Iris show. But it’s bops like “This Is Halloween” and “Jack’s Obsession” that will be engraved on his future tombstone, and he’s never been ashamed to play the hits — unlike Disney, which had no clue how to release the movie to an audience weaned on The Little Mermaid and Beauty and the Beast, but has since incorporated its parts into everything from theme parks to 3D re-releases to the Disney Dreamlight Valley sim. And unlike his film score work, The Nightmare Before Christmas gives him the chance to take the stage.

In 2013, the former Oingo Boingo frontman returned to the stage at the Royal Albert Hall to perform his scores from Tim Burton movies with a full orchestral backup. This included select numbers from The Nightmare Before Christmas, which he sang in full. The concert appearance was such a hit, Disney invited Elfman to appear alongside his co-stars Catherine O’Hara (Sally) and Ken Page (Oogie Boogie) at the Hollywood Bowl in Los Angeles for a night purely dedicated to The Nightmare Before Christmas. The concert was such a hit, the group has performed it on the regular every October — and will do so again this Halloween.

The hype around his various Burton and Nightmare Before Christmas concerts sparked the idea for Coachella programmers that Elfman could play alongside pop acts of the moment. As Elfman tells it, there was immediate and obvious hesitation on his part: He was not a rock star or a pop star or hip-hop star. But after watching Childish Gambino and Janelle Monáe unleash pure theatrical mayhem at Coachella 2019, he saw his way in. The then-66-year-old began immediate work on a set that would blend his film music, Oingo Boingo hits, and experimental songs fit for a rowdy crowd.

As he put in a video for the music festival, “Coming out and doing something as myself, not as Jack [Skellington], was terrifying and exciting.”

Coachella 2020 was ultimately canceled due to the COVID-19 pandemic, but Elfman was purely activated and kept on creating. He released his new music as a studio album, Big Mess, and eventually took the Coachella stage in his now-notorious 2022 performance. As envisioned, the Elfman revue bounced from known tunes to weirdo grooves, all backed by animated graphics that paired well with, uh, extracurricular substances. But it was not a total upending of expectations; there was still room for Mr. Skellington at Coachella.

In a flurry of post-show interviews, Elfman comes off as rejuvenated. While the show hasn’t realigned the trajectory of his career — he went on to score White Noise for director Noah Baumbach and continues to tour with his symphonic works — it’s hard to imagine him shaking the moment in the spotlight. (This is where I want to flag that earlier this year, a Rolling Stone report uncovered a 2018 sexual misconduct lawsuit filed against the composer, which he settled out of court. Elfman has vehemently denied the accusations against him as “vicious and wholly false.” No additional accusations or investigations have come out in the wake of the story, and Disney and his longtime collaborators continue to work with him.)

During the Coachella set, Elfman proclaimed that it was “my first time onstage as ‘myself’ in 27 years.” He’s likely referring to his time acting as Jack Skellington, though looking back, it doesn’t seem like Elfman as the frontman of Oingo Boingo was his true “self” either. The act launched at Coachella is not a return to form. It is the final form.

There are few musical wanderers like Elfman, capable of swinging between genres and mediums and venues, and his time performing as Jack Skellington has everything to do with that elasticity. He is now unified — as a six-packed weirdo rock star with floppy red hair and body tattoos head-banging to the theme from The Simpsons.

Elfman has said at the time that there were no plans to tour his laser-lit Coachella act, although he busted it out earlier this year at the North Island Credit Union Amphitheatre in California. It seems entirely possible that Elfman’s rock star persona will explode out of nowhere with the rhythm of his percussive scores. That seems like the best-case scenario for a musician who never wants to be defined, and is often trapped in the conventions of his business. A regular Jack Skellington.

Correction: A previous version of this story stated that Elfman performed at Royal Albert Hall in 2014. He performed his Music of Tim Burton concert in 2013.

entertainment,Charlie Hall,2023-12-13T15:00:00+00:00,"After more than a decade of going on and on about the “board gaming renaissance,” it’s safe to say that tabletop role-play is finally having its moment in the spotlight. But while Dungeons & Dragons’ OGL fiasco has clearly lit a fire under many players eager to make a change, the fact of the matter is that a sizeable cohort of writers and designers have been toiling away at excellent games for years now. Their tireless efforts have yielded a bumper crop of excellent, some might say genre-defining, TTRPGs. Just like board games, a few modern classics have also cropped up: Look no further than The Quiet Year and The One Ring, both making their second appearance on this list.

Just as before, Polygon asked nearly two dozen writers, designers, presenters, actors, and personalities from around the world of tabletop gaming to share with our readers the TTRPGs that made an impact on them and their players this year. Here’s what we found.

City of Winter

Linda Codega, Ennie Award-winning entertainment journalist

My friends and I still talk about the weekend we spent playing City of Winter. With lightweight rules but a heavy emphasis on the kind of ephemera usually reserved for much crunchier games, creating space for this game is almost as important as who you chose to play it with. Characters travel along a cloth map that illustrates a landscape with only barest indications of topography; the focus instead relies on themes of assimilation, diaspora, and — most importantly to the narrative — baggage. As a family of immigrants (bound by blood or by choice), players describe their home, their traditions, and then, as a darkness comes from the west side of the map, they leave it all behind, choosing what traditions and rituals they pick up from the places they visit and what they hold on to from their homeland. As far as games go, there are probably very few out there that require such a strict fidelity to the road laid out before you, but City of Winter uses this structure to facilitate the kind of deeply resonant character arcs and development that many role-players crave in their games. An astoundingly complex game, bringing your best stories to the table will leave you with a sense of loss and belonging that seem to walk together, hand in hand.

Dead After Dinner

Jason Morningstar, owner, creative director, and lead designer at Bully Pulpit Games

Jenn Martin’s game Dead After Dinner combines the relentless procedural revelation of For the Queen with Knives Out-style murder mystery, and it is endlessly hilarious. Everyone is part of a miserable family stuffed with resentment, somebody is getting killed, there will be uncomfortable questions, and a murderer will definitely be revealed. Or will they? Dead After Dinner is a truly pick-up-and-play murder mystery that will delight you and your scenery-chewing friends.

Desperation

Tim Hutchings, game designer and academic

The best game I’ve played this year is a tie between Desperation by Jason Morningstar and Orestes’ Choice by Susanne Vejdemo. Desperation is a card-driven TTRPG with a marvelous mechanic: Players draw a card with a bit of spoken text on it and then assign those words to one of the characters in play. It is so dang smart and makes for rich yet tight storytelling as the cards force new contexts for the actions of the characters.

The game comes with two dark American Gothic-flavored scenarios: a starving Kansas town locked in a brutal winter and a cursed fishing boat lost in the north Pacific. The faux woodcuts by Jabari Weathers and Brennen Reece are wonderful to look upon and convey the game’s tone as much as the flavorful card text.

My best game experience was Orestes’ Choice, a LARP by Susanne Vejdemo. It’s the first heavy-duty chamber LARP I’ve played since the pandemic; it reset my brain and helped me remember what I value in play. Players continuously swap roles as they play through a very queer Greek myth in which young Orestes returns home and must decide whether to kill his treacherous mother and father-in-law. Never have I planned a murder with such erotically charged practice stabbing.

Dungeon Crawl Classics

Thilo Graf of AAW Games

I run and play a ton of different RPG systems, but precious few have had such a tremendous and lasting impact on my design and games as Dungeon Crawl Classics by Goodman Games.

With aesthetics influenced by all-time greats like Leiber and Moorcock, volatile magic, a relatively flat power curve for a d20-based game, and an emphasis on the skill of the players, as opposed to primarily rewarding the crafting of effective builds, DCC is a joy to run and play. It is not as much of a heroic power fantasy as D&D 5e or Pathfinder, but neither is it as minimalist as many old-school games. With fickle gods, mutating magics, lucky scoundrels, and ferocious fighters, DCC feels like playing through a Bal-Sagoth or Eternal Champion song. It’s also easy to pick up if your group has any experience with D&D’s third edition or Pathfinder. DCC rocks! Its focus on simple, impactful rules was a core design inspiration for the (almost system-neutral) Survivalist’s Guide to Spelunking for 5e, a book I wrote with Douglas Niles and Stephen Yeardley. It warms my heart to know that DCC authors, judges, and players use the book as well!

Dungeons & Dragons

Mike Haracz, corporate R&D chef and host of Heroes’ Feast

I’m lucky enough to be in the seventh year of a homebrew Dungeons & Dragons campaign, one I play with friends locally in the Chicagoland area. Our campaign is called The Heartsguard Saga, and it’s based off Deven Rue’s map of a place called Euphoros. My players are at around level 15 and I frequently give them a variety of amazing and unique gear that I’ve dreamed up all on my own... which they go on to forget they have, and never use. We used to play in person, but since the pandemic I run the game virtually online from my house. I put a camera hovering over my gaming mat, and make a labeled grid for the players so they call out, “Move me from A5 to B10.” During important rolls, I even make my players face their camera toward their dice for added suspense!

Petrana Radulovic, entertainment reporter

I’d wanted to play Dungeons & Dragons since I was in high school, but I never knew how to get into it. Thankfully, in the doldrums of 2020, someone I knew knew someone who knew someone (that’s literally what the connection was) who was interested in running a game. That kicked off my D&D career, but was this year that everything finally clicked in my brain and it went from a hobby I enjoyed to one that I spend every free minute of my spare time thinking about.

Part of it is finally having reliable groups. After some initial shuffling of members, in 2023 I’ve been blessed to have not one but two separate D&D groups, both with enthusiastic members who are committed to at least trying to meet regularly. And yes, part of it is Baldur’s Gate 3, which helped me to understand some of the more complicated D&D mechanics and just generally made me very excited about combat in a way I never was before.

I’ve still yet to actually have a game in person! My groups are spread out across North America, but I’m hoping to manifest an in-person session soon. Here’s to 2024 being an even better D&D year for me.

Eating Oranges in the Shower

Sam Dunnewold, Dice Exploder podcast

The Golden Cobra challenge is always a deep well of exciting (and free!) new larps from the bleeding edge of the hobby. This year, like a song that’s stuck in my head, I haven’t been able to stop thinking about Eating Oranges in the Shower by Hazel Anneke Dixon, a game about exactly what it sounds like. You play as members of a group chat who discover the /r/ShowerOrange subreddit, a real community dedicated to the “liberating” act of eating an orange while taking a shower. You each decide to try this out for yourself before returning to compare notes, and because it’s a LARP, you actually go do the thing.

This game is so strange and delightful, not to mention delicious. The principal act is compelling on its own. It feels forbidden somehow, even as it’s obviously harmless.

But Dixon also captures something ephemeral and nostalgic about what it’s like to be in a niche online community and group chat, and the magic of making discoveries in those spaces. On an increasingly centralized internet, that experience has become rare, and I miss it.

Exquisite Biome

Everest Pipkin, game and software developer

I’ve heard Exquisite Biome described as “Spore for the kitchen table,” and if that isn’t a great pitch I don’t know what is.

Coming from Caro Asercion (game designer) and Si Sweetman (illustrator), Exquisite Biome is in the world-building TTRPG tradition, but it focuses specifically on ecological biomes and the creatures that populate them. Through short generative prompts tied to a deck of playing cards, you build and witness the lives of animals far beyond the edge of our own world. Playing Exquisite Biome feels a little bit like being David Attenborough on an alien planet.

With beautiful, evocative art and short, easy-to-parse rules, Exquisite Biome is my go-to “what if we made up some weird little guys and set them in motion for an hour” game. And truly, what higher calling is there?

Home

Wesley “Nox” Crowe, aka Noxweiler Berf, creative director for Hunters Entertainment

Doug Levandowski and Yeonsoo Julian Kim’s Home drew me in immediately, and has been one of my most recommended tabletop role-playing games. If you know me or my work, then the fact that it’s a horror game probably won’t come as much of a surprise. It’s a haunted house exploration simulator that can be played with a full table of players or alone as a solo journaling experience. It uses custom tarot cards and a whiteboard to track your character’s progress as they dare to shine a light on the chilling danger of a variety of potential scenarios full of ghosts and other dark entities.

​The action is propelled through the use of the custom tarot cards — the Night Deck — which are filled with prompts that require the creative interaction of players. Each round, players take turn as the director of the story and guide the narrative forward using the guidance of the cards to describe and draw each room of the haunted house that they are exploring. The game encourages collaboration in determining the story’s direction and does a remarkable job of steering the action forward without a single game master putting forth the often large amount of preparation that role-playing games usually require.

​As the game progresses, characters collect wounds and push past the terrors that await them and work together to resolve the mysteries at the root of each horror. The solo mode of the game plays just as smoothly as the group experience, leaning on the prompts and player’s imagination to create a journal documenting the character’s harrowing encounter.

I can’t recommend it enough. Grab a copy of the PDF, turn down the lights, and start mapping your own haunted house!

The Luminant Age

I became an immediate fan of Luminant Age after being invited to be a contributor. What caught my eye at the start was the Four Humanities ancestries named Blood, Clay, Silk, and Horn. This year, many of my Thursday mornings have been a whirlwind of weird as our playtest party encounter teleporting flickrats, heal via esseweaving, and get hunted down by cultists in stryx bonemasques. The city we’re in, Ourichor, is built on giant oil-rig-like platforms in the open ocean. There are no sun nor stars, but three moons... that you’re allowed to see.

Also, did I mention the predominant religion featured, the Angelites, memorialize their dead by preserving their eyeballs? You can even wear them as mourning jewelry.

This Pathfinder 2nd edition-compatible setting has been as enchantingly addictive as the fictional ichor that propelled Ourichor into the renaissance era that the project is named after. While there are only two exquisitely illustrated supplements on creatures and equipment available currently, I recommend those with a love of the unusual to keep an eye out for more in the years to come, such as the upcoming Paragons of Luminant Age that introduces NPCs and explores their motives through the four moons.

Marvel Multiverse Role-playing Game

As a role-player, I’ve spent a lot of time looking for a good lightweight superhero RPG. I’ve tried quite a few but had yet to find one that really hit the mark for me until I tried Marvel Multiverse Role-playing Game. I have to say, I was initially dubious about this game but it has blown me out of the water. The game is utterly devoted to giving the players the feeling of playing a hero in the Marvel universe with tons of cool powers and power categories based on key Marvel heroes like Spider-Man and the Hulk. The system is easy, streamlined, and really carries the four-color comic book flavor. Probably one of the coolest aspects of the game is that while there is an exhaustive list of Marvel heroes and villains at the back of the book, you can create your own hero with their own power set and use that “bestiary” of heroic and villainous figures as allies and enemies in your own heroic adventures. For those of us who’ve always wanted to make their own X-Gene Mutant, Spirit of Vengeance, or Spidersona, this is a must-have book that will bring hours of enjoyment.

Masks of the Masks

Superhero comics, for all their many flaws, remain my life’s great passion. That’s why, of all the games I’ve played this year, the one I want to shout about from the rooftops is Masks of the Masks by Hazel Amber Goswick. The game is an incredible piece of art: a tabletop RPG presented as a fully illustrated comic book, an homage to Bronze Age superhero stories just as Watchmen did, that critically explores and examines the violence inherent in its medium. It’s an absolute joy to behold as you flip through it; you can feel the love, consideration, and attention to detail dripping off of every move and every panel. Then, in play, it’s a revelation; a brilliant blend of Belonging Outside Belonging and Powered by the Apocalypse that builds on some of the luminaries of both systems to create something that just sings. Plus, it has some of the most wicked advancement mechanics I’ve run into in years, that both add to the play experience while heightening the ever-looming sense of dread and tragedy that’s so essential to comics of that time period. Cannot recommend enough.

The Monster Overhaul

The Monster Overhaul, by Skerples, reimagines not just the monsters, but the very notion of what a bestiary can and should be. The book is divided into 20 categories, each containing 10 critters that hew to a theme. The categories are unusual: There is “Dragons,” of course, but also “Summer” and “A Wizard Did It.” “Summer” monsters include the Froghemoth and Pyromancers. Some of these may sound similar to classic D&D monsters, others are entirely new. Tables galore help build and flesh out encounters. “Summer” has a set of generic swamp hexes; other entries have lairs and dungeons. There is an entire flowchart table for populating a megadungeon. Every page of this book is designed to make the reader think about monsters, how to make them feel new, or to recontextualize them, or to simply subvert player expectations. Like all great RPG supplements, The Monster Overhaul not only offers answers for these questions and more, it also teaches the reader how to continue answering them long after these published tables and suggestions are exhausted. A monstrous achievement that should be on every GM’s shelf.

Bonus: Reach of the Roach God

Reach of the Roach God is the hardcover high-watermark of A Thousand Thousand Islands (ATTI), a series of zines, that presents a system-agnostic setting inspired by the folklore of Southeast Asia. Odoyoq, the roach god, senses new ways it can insinuate itself into the lives of non-roachkind. The three schemes are presented as both traditional adventures and as collections of facts — about the setting, about the people living there and their motivations, about the desires of the god and the machinations of its agents. Events will quickly throw a small village, a monastery, and a necropolis into chaos. Two gazetteers and a sourcebook on the roaches follow, giving the GM ample material to expand the campaign. All this is wrapped in Munkao’s fantastically disgusting artwork. His vistas and cultural portraits are gorgeous, but when he brings his talents to bear on feelers and chitin and filth, the results are revolting in the best possible way. Sadly, this is likely the final installment in the ATTI series and unlikely to be reprinted, so get this book while you can!

Monsterhearts

Figuring out what to talk about proved trickier than I expected. A lot of the things I played this year were playtests or previews for things not out yet, which would feel more like a humblebrag than a recommendation, or were my own games which were great to play but would feel a bit weird and self-indulgent to suggest as the “best.”

A really pleasant TTRPG memory I had from this year was playing Monsterhearts for the first time in three years. This was one of the first games I ever played (for ages afterwards I kept calling playbooks in every game “skins”). I played a one-shot with some friends I was reconnecting with and we mostly group game mastered. We played a gang of messy screw-ups who didn’t hugely get along, my character had traded her old gender to the fae over the summer, and we tried to investigate a potential monster hunter, a NPC most of our characters found too cool to talk to. There was a gag about someone doing a club remix of “Danny Boy” at a memorial service and the group chat with those friends is still named “Danny Boyz (The Pipes, The Pipes).”

Mörk Borg

Jasmine Bhullar, writer, content creator, executive producer of DesiQuest

Of the games I delved into this year, although several afforded hours of entertainment, I felt myself repeatedly returning to one in particular. Although Mörk Borg was released in 2020, it was only in 2023 that I happily stumbled upon it and was able to somehow get a table together to run a game. The book itself has a stunning and distinct art style that immediately transports you into the doom metal fantasy of the setting; but that’s only a small part of its allure.

Unlike many TTRPGs that one merely has aspirations of playing one day, Mörk Borg does everything in its power to make the game easy to run. Although it’s a short read, no line is wasted. Even item descriptions are dripping with hints at nefarious deeds one must have done to acquire them. The optional classes are an absolute delight for those of us that savor the idea of playing the unsavory. From the esoteric introverts that choose to make their hovel far from prying eyes to the unfortunate discarded-at-birth cutthroats who’ve had to scratch out a living any way they can, there is something for everyone. There is always the option of creating something more tailor-made if none of the classes are appealing, but I appreciate that Mörk Borg offers beginner-friendly ideas and archetypes to help you create something that fits right into the gritty setting. Furthermore, in the process of putting a game together, I found a glut of free online tools from dungeon generators to NPC character sheet generators that made game prep a breeze. I find myself coming back to this game again and again with each game session only giving me ideas for future campaigns. I know I’m not alone in this feeling given the number of Mörk Borg-compatible games that have sprung up this year, from Pirate Borg to Chris Lockey’s upcoming Abyss of Hallucinations.

I’m Sorry Did You Say Street Magic

Madison Durham, writer and journalist, staff writer at Reviewed

To me, some of the most joyful moments in tabletop gaming come from the experience of creative collaboration — the magic of making something new with friends, be it a narrative, a character, a world, or in this case, a city. I’m Sorry Did You Say Street Magic by Caro Asercion is a GM-less city-building game, played between a group of two to six people with a stack of index cards and your favorite writing utensils. The whimsically illustrated rulebook lays out the tools by which you’ll lay bricks for your city, weaving together your ideas and your fellow players’ to establish Landmarks, Residents, and Neighborhoods, all on a quest to find the city’s true names. It’s a beautifully simple game, guided by a Compass, which can be anything — literally. It’s almost impossible for me to capture the magic of this game with words, because each session we played was so entirely unique, from the verdant turtle-city in the sky we built out in stages to the haunted shell of a city we later used as our D&D setting. It’s a perfect game full stop, but especially for those seeking to rekindle their creativity, or simply to sit down and create with friends.

Triangle Agency

“I laughed so hard my face hurt.” —me, 10 minutes after my first session of Triangle Agency

I love a game with style and a clear, fun point of view, so I’ve been a fan of Triangle Agency since I picked up its player guide in beta form earlier this year (to prep for writing a published adventure for the game). Written in the form of a cheerful, slightly threatening employee handbook, the Field Agent Manual guides you through the creation of your supernaturally powered character, then gets you ready for your role finding and containing Anomalies that threaten the nature of reality. After your team’s morning meeting, of course.

Beyond the style of the materials, though, playing the game was an absolute blast. The mix of mundane life, weird occurrences, and corporate BS created a fast-paced game experience that was playful and easy to understand (just count those threes!), got every player invested in our characters and each other (even in a group of total strangers), and allowed the whole table to lean into both the strange and ridiculous nature of life. This year, it was just the kind of joy that I needed.

2023 was a personal tabletop gold mine. We finally got Brennan Lee Mulligan’s first official 5e homebrew; I discovered tabletop meetup hub and game master meat market StartPlaying.Games, where you can, as I have, hire a handsome Scottish man to D&D dominate you and your friends every week; and I played a ton of my new favorite party game, As You ’Wich. It’s a dead-simple hand-builder that, for me at least, boils down to convincing your nephews to eat disgusting sandwiches (hair, mustard, and broken glass on marble rye, absolutely not toasted). But the fresh grand dame of my tabletop world is Triangle Agency, a gleaming, razor-sharp new TTRPG that feels like a cross between The X-Files, Annihilation, and playing Control with the Robert Anton Wilson mod turned on.

In Triangle Agency, you are super-abled agents investigating and stopping ontological anomalies from destroying reality, with mechanics that feel like the platonic ideal mix of analytic crunch and grand narrative weirdness. And my god, it is gorgeous, with jaw-dropping art and design that puts it on the same shelf as Wanderhome and Mörk Borg. The full game ships early in 2024, but you can get the digital rules and start playing right now, for the low, low price of “whatever you think is appropriate.”

Twilight: 2000

Charlie Hall, senior editor, tabletop

I firmly believe that tabletop role-play should always take into account the audience that sits down at the table to play. That’s part of the reason why I hate best-of lists for this particular category of games in particular. What difference does it make if something scores highly on some arbitrary rubric if it doesn’t resonate with the people in your community? And so I look at year-end lists like these as a kind of menu, boards of fare that clever game masters can use to pick just the right flavor for a given table.

For me this year was all about reconnecting with the other dads in my neighborhood after years spent locked inside during the pandemic. I spun up a Discord that we used to organize friendly games of Call of Duty’s DMZ mode, organized a few visits to the local brewery to catch up make new connections, and generally just tried to get awkward, middle-aged men accustomed to seeing each other socially again. One night I decided to bust out Twilight: 2000, and it was an instant hit.

Twilight: 2000 is a game about surviving in the aftermath of a fictional nuclear conflict in the heart of Europe. It’s an alternate history where the Cold War went hot, swallowing up an entire United States Marine division. Players take on the role of soldiers and other hangers-on just trying to make it out alive. The heady mix of dice-driven gunplay and a playing-card-style encounter creation makes it easy to run. But the fun begins even before that with character generation, which uses old school randomized tables to simulate an entire military career. If you’re looking to get your video gaming buddies around the table for something that doesn’t require a headset or shouting down pre-teens in a glitchy public lobby, the all-inclusive starter set comes highly recommended.

Project ECCO

It’s a near-impossible task to get a consistent group together, so solo TTRPGs have become my primary method of gaming. However, the barrier for me is finding a game with a balance of narrative and mechanics that isn’t overwhelmingly crunchy, but also isn’t open-ended to the point of choice paralysis. For me, Project ECCO found that balance.

A story of time travel and cosmic horror, Project ECCO is easy to get into and relatively quick to play (three to 10 hours per game). Between the hundreds of narrative prompts, unlocking various time travel “devices” (coins, dice, tarot cards, etc.), and the absolutely stunning layout, this is one of my favorite TTRPGs, period.

Played in the pages of a yearly planner, Project ECCO hits every beat of a good time-travel story: time loops and timeline divergences, a shady and controlling Time Travel Agency, and an unknowable cosmic Entity consuming spacetime. As you play, you (literally) burn through the days of your planner, creating an artifact, marked and changed by the telling of your agent’s story.

For an example of gameplay and a masterfully produced actual play, listen to the Project ECCO miniseason of My First Dungeon with game designer Elliot Davis.

The Quiet Year

Em Friedman, associate professor of English at Auburn University and Polygon contributor

Look, The Quiet Year appeared not once but twice on last year’s roundup, I know. Jay Dragon praised its elegance and Keerthi Sridharan noted the way their game group used it as a prologue (as Friends at the Table and The Adventure Zone have popularized), and it’s a standard early on in my TTPRG class. But for me it was the standout game of this year because after running it for my niece (then 4) and nephew (8), my nephew asked that I run “the skulls game” for his entire class. While not intended for a dozen grade schoolers, it turns out the mechanics of The Quiet Year — which ensure everyone gets to have their turn unimpeded by the commentary of others, ritualizes dissent and discussion, as well as having a glorious sheet of blank paper to draw the zombie chicken monster friend of your dreams — turned out to be a perfect framework to imagine how to work together. All that, and it fits in my pocket.

What Dust Remains

Danny Quach, Digital Thiccness, TTRPG writer, designer, and performer

Despite my generally sunny disposition, big smile, and boisterous laughter (as well as being deemed the internet’s emotional support himbo), I love all of my emotions — the good, bad, and ugly. I love emo/screamo/post-hardcore music and exploring the darkness through lyrics. I love the gothic and macabre, finding comfort in losing something you once had. I love horror movies and the inherent queerness of being an outcast being pushed to their limits. And I love games that explore themes of melancholy and loss. Enter: What Dust Remains by 2022 Diana Jones Emerging Designer award winner Bianca Canoza — aka Momatoes. Taught by the designer herself, I got to play this at Big Bad Con 2023 with two other strangers who quickly became co-collaborators in this tragic world we built in under two hours that told a story of a legacy that wasn’t quite within reach. Impassioned and intriguing card-prompted questions along with focused, intense moments of dice rolls that helped move the story along, What Dust Remains challenged me to discover, explore, and sit in moments of despair and desperation and had the whole table contemplating what parts of us are we going to sacrifice to leave a legacy that would be bigger than we could ever be behind.

The Wildsea

Earlier this year, I searched for the perfect system to kickstart my new actual-play campaign with three “must-haves” in mind: a vivid world, rich character options, and simple but punchy rules. Through sheer accident (providence?), I stumbled upon The Wildsea by Felix Isaacs and Mythworks — and it was love at first sight.

In this game, players embody wildsailors: swashbuckling adventurers who traverse a strange and vibrant world made of fantastical vegetation. The character generation process encourages delightfully bizarre concepts like pinwolf-taming sharpshooters trapped in amber, omen-speaking moth chefs, or even collections of a thousand spiders wearing skin suits. The mechanics are structured around a d6 dice pool system with bands of success that generate interesting outcomes no matter what you roll.

The beautifully illustrated rulebook not only allowed me to add my own twists, but actively endorsed it, with multiple sections dedicated to alternate ways of running encounters and ideas for creating your own unique lore. My players and I had an absolute BLAST playing The Wildsea both on and off stream, and we were stoked (but not surprised!) when it won an Ennie this year. If you’re looking for a narratively focused game with an imaginative world and mechanics that inspire cinematic play, then give The Wildsea a shot!",The best tabletop RPGs we played in 2023,https://www.polygon.com/23989775/best-tabletop-rpgs-2022,Polygon
entertainment,Cass Marshall,2023-12-06T13:00:00+00:00,"“In the grim darkness of the far future, there is only war.” That’s the tagline of Warhammer 40,000, one of the most over-the-top and brutal sci-fi settings around. But even in a merciless, brutal dystopia that grinds its people into dust, some get to enjoy being on the top of the food chain. Warhammer 40,000: Rogue Trader is about the perils and pleasures of being atop that particular hierarchy.

Rogue Traders in 40K are freelance explorers, scouting the far frontiers of the Imperium of Man. It’s a risky career, but it comes with luxurious rewards: agency, freedom, power, and a giant flagship. As the player, I explore a system of the Imperium with a loyal crew of companions, making impactful choices and determining the fate of those around me.

Rogue Trader is a computer role-playing game in the vein of Baldur’s Gate 3 or Pillars of Eternity. I create my custom protagonist, determining stats and bonuses based on my backstory, home world, and so on. I’m then thrust into a high-pressure job interview as a potential heir to a Rogue Trader aboard her flagship. Little do we know that there’s a coup in the works, and traitors aboard the ship. After a deadly struggle against heretics and demons, I ascend to the position of Rogue Trader. I’m the captain now, and I get to decide how to run my ship.

This is a vast game, with tons of features you’d expect from a CRPG — companions (each with their own narrative paths and conversation trees), top-down strategic combat, and branching choices that impact the world around you. I get to make choices all day — in fact, that’s part of the gig of a Rogue Trader. Some are more important than others; whenever I get to specific points in the story, I can choose from one of three major paths. Dogmatic choices exult the God-Emperor and loathe the mutant and the witch, the Heretical options pursue corruptive power, and the Ionoclast path is the closest thing we have to modern-day “good guy” morality.

After the events of the tutorial, my beautiful voidship is run down and my staff is struggling. As the newly anointed Rogue Trader, I have to trek around the various planets of the Koronus Expanse to get a new Navigator, fix my ship up, and avoid any major diplomatic incidents with the locals. My voidship is the size of a modern city; I’m as much a governor as a captain, and I have to manage the ship, its cargo, and its many occupants.

In the process of getting back on my feet, I uncover a nefarious cult and a deep conspiracy. It’s not an easy job, but I’m blessed with a handful of companions from the Imperium to help me out. I can call on them to unlock doors or perform other environmental checks, but they come most in handy in combat.

When I meet opposition, it’s deeply satisfying to control my troops in a turn-based battle. Each fight takes place on a grid; it’s very similar to Baldur’s Gate 3 or even XCOM 2. Some positions provide cover, while others are out in the open. Friendly fire is also a very real concern. An arc of auto-fire from a bolter, or a Navigator’s third eye opening, can harm friend as well as foe. My Rogue Trader is a sniper, and she would be lost without her Senechal taking the front lines. There’s a lot of firepower at my disposal, and it’s mostly quite satisfying to use — even if I occasionally shred my poor Senechal with a devastating AOE.

I can chat with the companions between battles, learning more about their pasts. Most of them have deep and dark secrets I can uncover with a little time or patience, and they have fascinating stories to tell. Abelard, my Senechal, is a guy who sucks morally but will back me to the absolute hilt. I grew to love hearing about his days in the Imperial Navy, and he was the one guy I felt like I could trust. Augusta, a Sister of Battle, starts as a one-note zealot, but cracks form in that facade when I learn about her past and doubts. Cassia and Pasqal both represent two sub-factions in 40K, and they have lots to share about the Navigators and Tech-Priests.

My absolute favorite companion is Marazhai Aezyrraesh, a dark space elf who feeds off the suffering of sentient beings. He’s cruel, depraved, and an absolute hoot. Yes, he may flay a few too many people for my tastes, but he’s the best companion to bring to a party.

In the grand scheme of things, this is one of the most complete and detailed explorations of the 40K universe you can find. The game is an homage to the Warhammer 40K RPGs from Fantasy Flight Games, including Rogue Trader and Dark Heresy. I spent years as a teenager and young adult poring over these sourcebooks (which Rogue Trader is inspired by), learning more about the tiny details of life in the Imperium. Developer Owlcat Games has paid the same attention to every detail of the Koronus Expanse. I delve into ancient facilities staffed by tech-priests of the Machine God, the hostile xenos city of Commorragh, or massive cities built to honor the God-Emperor of Mankind.

I love the characters, the environments, the writing, the lore, and the flow of battles. But I have concerns with the game’s pacing. By the end of the first chapter, I had leveled up 16 times. Each level offered marginal rewards, like being able to move slightly farther during the character’s turn in combat or having a higher parry chance when being attacked. A slow drip-feed system means each level feels less important, and even though I’m growing stronger, I don’t get that sense of long-term satisfaction.

It’s especially frustrating to hit a roadblock like the one at the end of Act 1, where an incredibly tough boss rolls out of nowhere and spanks my crew — and I can’t leave to go grind experience somewhere else. I eventually found out a way to cheese the fight by focusing on my melee fighters’ positioning, but it took far too long banging my head against the wall. The victory tasted like ash in my mouth after all that frustration.

Voidship combat is another aspect that feels clunky and frustrating. Like the squad-based skirmishes, naval encounters are also turn-based, where positioning is ultra important. Space naval battles should feel tense, but instead, I’m mostly annoyed at having to continually rotate my ship and set up my zones of attack. I wish I could delegate these annoyances to my Senechal — to delegate the duties of character leveling and ship combat, the better to appreciate all of the things Rogue Trader is doing so well.

Rogue Trader is a dense, vast game, and much of it has clearly been crafted with love for the expansive lore of the 40K canon. While there are small annoyances and clunky features along the way, the political intrigue, cast of characters, and moral choices have me hooked. For 40K fans, this is a rare treat — a game that digs past the heroic facade of bolters and battles and taps into the grimdark dystopia that makes this particular sci-fi setting so damn compelling.

entertainment,,2023-11-17T09:00:48+00:00,"Young Emily Hand, born with a gift for dance, should be bouncing to her favorite Beyoncé songs, celebrating her ninth birthday on Friday.

Instead, ""she will have her birthday in the tunnels of Gaza,"" her grief-stricken father, Thomas Hand, told Fox News Digital in an interview this week in New York City.

""No party. No friends. She won’t even know if it’s day or night. There’s no light down there. So she won’t know it’s her birthday.""

WOMAN VANDALIZES ISRAELI HOSTAGE POSTERS RIGHT IN FRONT OF CAPTIVES' OWN FAMILY IN NEW YORK CITY

Emily woke up the morning of Oct. 7 after a sleepover at a friend’s house in the kibbutz of Be’eri in southern Israel.

She still ""had Disney pajamas on,"" her father said.

Hamas terrorists hauled her away along with her friend, Hila, and the other girl’s mother, Raya.

Emily was only 2½ years old when her own mother died of breast cancer.

She's been raised by her dad and by others in their tightly knit kibbutz in the years since.

The child's birthday will be marked here in America with billboards that go on display in Times Square and Madison Square Garden in Manhattan at 8 a.m. on Friday.

""She will have her birthday in the tunnels of Gaza. No party. No friends. She won’t even know if it’s day or night.""

Billboards with images of Israelis held hostage in Gaza will also appear in 1,500 other locations in 48 cities across the United States.

It’s part of an effort to remind Americans that some 240 Israeli civilians, including children like Emily, were snatched from concerts, from their homes and even from their beds in a surprise attack by Hamas terrorists against unarmed civilian targets.

Bring Them Home Now, an organic volunteer group that came together in the hours after the attack, heads the international outreach effort.

Emily, even at 9, is older than many of the hostages. The youngest was just 9 months old when snatched away as a trophy of terror.

Thomas Hand’s suffering over the past 40 days has made international headlines. He was first told in the days after the terror attack that his little girl was dead.

CHILDREN HELD HOSTAGE BY TERROR GROUP: ‘BRING THEM HOME NOW’ SAYS IT WON'T REST UNTIL ALL ARE RETURNED SAFELY

He said in one interview that he welcomed her death because it was better than her being held captive and tortured by Hamas.

He found out later that his daughter had been taken hostage by Hamas.

Emily, ""just loved life and music,"" her father said. ""Beyoncé is a favorite because Beyoncé is a beautiful singer and a very good dancer. And so Emily would copy her.""

""She had this gift that she could memorize movements, she could just memorize whole routines, and she would do it within a very short time.""

Her natural dancing talent was apparent to everyone in Be’eri, not far from the border of Gaza.

""Every holiday they'd have performances of little kids and older kids, so she was always in it. But she was always there front and center because she would always remember the moves if the kids at the back didn't.""

""Beyoncé in particular is a favorite because Beyoncé is a beautiful singer and a very good dancer … Emily would copy her.""

Hand shared stories of his beautiful girl and the ugly circumstances of her abduction in an interview at Central Synagogue in Midtown Manhattan.

Hand himself is not Jewish.

He was born in Dublin, Ireland, and raised Roman Catholic before moving in 1992 to Israel — a nation he called a multicultural ""paradise"" up until Oct. 7.

He last saw Emily the night of Oct. 6 at dinner in the communal dining room of the kibbutz.

She asked after dinner if she could sleep over her friend’s house.

He agreed and kissed her goodbye.

ISRAELI MOM RECOUNTS LAST CALL FROM TERRIFIED DAUGHTER AS ‘BRING THEM HOME NOW’ VOWS FIND HAMAS HOSTAGES

Initial reports that Emily had been killed were later refuted by official accounts.

""We had an eyewitness seeing her being led away by the terrorists with her friend where she was doing a sleepover and the mother of that friend. So it's absolutely confirmed that she was taken away by the terrorists and is in the tunnels of Gaza now.""

Emily and the others in the family she was staying with hid, like many of the hostages taken from homes, in the household bomb shelters common in Israel. They're designed to protect Israeli citizens from frequent missile attacks.

Officials told Hand ""in all probability she's in Gaza because there was no blood in the bomb shelter and there was no blood in the house that matched Emily's DNA,"" he said.

Life has been almost unbearable for him since that day.

Hand was described as ""fragile"" by one person working with family members of the Israeli hostages.

Hand spoke to Fox News Digital beside Michael Levy, whose brother Or was also taken hostage by terrorists.

Hand said he's lost about 18 pounds since his little girl was taken hostage on Oct. 7.

They were accompanied by Israeli mental health expert Dr. Ofrit Shapira-Berman.

""I'm Irish, so I have a couple of beers before I go to bed and that sets me off because I don't want to think,"" the father said. ""I wouldn't be able to sleep. I'm eating very little. My stomach is shrunk.""

A lean man to begin with, Hand said he’s lost 8 kilos — about 18 pounds — since his little girl was taken hostage.

""I had a hot dog today. I always wanted an American hot dog, and I was full after that.""

He's lost interest in news amid his own pain and the ongoing pain of the entire nation of Israel.

""I'm a refugee. I have no home to go back to.""

""At first it was a morbid curiosity to maybe see Emily amongst it all. And then it was just too much. I couldn't watch it anymore. I don't watch the news. I don't watch these videos.""

He’s also been homeless since Be’eri was savaged.

""I'm a refugee,"" he said. ""I have no home to go back to.""

The community ""lost 112 murdered and so many, many more kidnapped"" among a population of about 1,200.

""Your whole community was devastated. Yeah, we’re all refugees,"" he said. ""We’re all living in various hotels all over the country.""

Yehudit Weiss was one of the residents of Be’eri taken hostage on Oct. 7. Israeli Defense Forces reported on Thursday that they found her body in a building adjacent to the Al-Shifa Hospital in Gaza, which Israel says Hamas had been using as a headquarters.

Hand expressed hope that the billboards going on display in Times Square on his daughter’s birthday, and then around the U.S., will remind Americans of the ongoing terror and antisemitism suffered by Israeli families — and do so in a medium that can't be defaced or removed from public view amid ongoing anti-Israeli hatred.

""The great thing about these billboards is that these — I don’t know what to call these people — won’t be able to rip down the images,"" Hand said.

""That’s the one thing I can’t understand. That they, children and the babies — they’ve been taken away, they’re kidnapped, they’re lost to us. And you know, just trying to make awareness, and they’re ripping them off with glee, with happiness.""

Minutes later, Hand and Levy were standing outside the synagogue, looking at posters of Israeli kidnap victims mounted on a fence in Midtown Manhattan.

A woman walked by and began tearing down the posters — a shocking indignity following the pain they had just shared and a visceral example of the intolerance suffered by Israelis in the Middle East and in the United States.

The father, already deeply pained, was incensed. He shouted out angrily, while the woman moved quickly down the sidewalk. She raised a hand behind her as if to mock the suffering father's pain.

""My daughter, she doesn't know if I was killed or kidnapped or somewhere else. She's in terror every day.""

Further pain is still to come, Hand said, if and when the hostages return and find out loved ones have been killed and entire families massacred.

He's also haunted by the fear Emily has suffered since Oct. 7 and now here on what should be her joyous birthday celebration embraced by the love of their kibbutz.

Editor’s pick

The Road to El Dorado

Year: 2000

﻿Run time: 1hr 29m

Directors: Eric “Bibo” Bergeron, Don Paul, Jeffrey Katzenberg

Cast: Kevin Kline, Kenneth Branagh, Rosie Perez

The Road to El Dorado came out at the wrong time.

The animated buddy comedy came out during the transition point between the Disney Renaissance and the eventual wave of crass CG movies ushered in by Shrek (what I’ve dubbed the Beloved Failures era). But even though it failed spectacularly in theaters, home video turned it into a cult classic and a meme powerhouse. So many frames of the movie have been repurposed as reaction GIFs and meme templates, but while the vivid facial expressions and body movement of the animated characters certainly lends itself to memeable formats, the movie itself is truly hilarious.

The setup is already promising: two runaway con men from Spain somehow end up in South America, where the locals of El Dorado believe them to be gods. But the banter between pragmatic Tulio and idealistic Miguel is absolutely amazing, with Kline and Branagh slipping into an easy and comedic repartee (not to mention the shipping potential that comes from their married-couple-like banter). Toss in snarky Chel (Rosie Perez), a local who wants out of the city, and the trio is electric — and distinctly made up of morally gray lying characters, a rarity in that era of animation where heroes and princesses save the day.

The three of them attempt to leave El Dorado with buckets of gold, but first they must play along with the charade, which only gets them into increasingly ridiculous situations. They partake in local festivities, go 2-vs-15 in a sports game, and eventually have to defend El Dorado from Conquistador Hernan Cortez. With each impossible feat, the ragtag trio of schemers pulls it off again and again, heightening their antics and plans — all with excellent banter (and a banging Elton John soundtrack). — Petrana Radulovic

The Road to El Dorado is available to stream on Netflix.

Book Club

Year: 2018

Run time: 1h 44m

Director: Bill Holderman

Cast: Diane Keaton, Jane Fonda, Candice Bergen, Mary Steenburgen

This delightful and raunchy romantic comedy stars Diane Keaton, Jane Fonda, Candice Bergen, and Mary Steenburgen as a group of best friends who have been a part of a long-standing book club. Each of them, though successful in their careers, are dealing with crises of life or love. When one of them picks Fifty Shades of Grey as the next book they’ll all read together, it opens the group up in a lovely story of personal acceptance and self-realization, no matter what stage of life you find yourself in. —PV

Book Club is available to stream on Paramount Plus and FuboTV, or for digital rental or purchase on Amazon, Apple TV, Google Play, and Vudu.

Catherine Called Birdy

Year: 2022

Run time: 1h 48m

Director: Lena Dunham

Cast: Bella Ramsey, Andrew Scott, Billie Piper

Lena Dunham’s adaptation of the beloved children’s novel is an outstanding coming-of-age story that is the rare book-to-movie adaptation done right. It’s a warm story about the difficulties of teenage girlhood and all the expectations that come with it in any era (but especially medieval times), anchored by excellent central performances from Bella Ramsey (Game of Thrones) and Andrew Scott (Fleabag).

Ramsey plays a young girl named Birdy, whose father (Scott) is attempting to arrange a marriage for her in order to save the family’s finances. A strong-willed girl with a penchant for playfulness and mischief, Birdy is intent on disrupting her father’s plans for her. The movie excels through its layered portrayals of Birdy and her father — neither is pure hero or pure villain, and Dunham complicates the book’s portrayal of the two to much success.

I put Catherine Called Birdy on one Saturday afternoon, expecting it to be enjoyable background fare while I played some games and did some work around the house. Instead, I was completely enthralled for all 108 minutes. It’s one of the most delightful movies of the year, and I can not recommend it highly enough. —PV

Catherine Called Birdy is available to stream on Prime Video.

Charade

Year: 1963

Run time: 1h 54m

Director: Stanley Donen

Cast: Cary Grant, Audrey Hepburn, Walter Matthau

The heist at the center of Charade was successful years prior to the movie, and without realizing it, Reggie (Audrey Hepburn) has been living off the profits from her husband’s crime. When he is suddenly murdered, she realizes she didn’t really know anything about him — or, for that matter, the new man in her life, Peter Joshua (Cary Grant). To make matters worse, the remaining money is missing, and a lot of terrible people think Reggie knows where it is. As more people are pulled into the orbit of the money, it becomes less clear who, if anyone, Reggie can trust.

Hepburn and Grant, two famously talented and charming stars, are at their most charming and talented in Charade. In the span of a single scene, Hepburn might move from pragmatic to seductive to fearful with believable ease. Grant’s initial discomfort with their age gap — 25 years, a still-not-uncommon chasm in Hollywood — resulted in rewrites to the script to make clear that Reggie was pursuing him; it remains one of the few movies in which the gap is acknowledged and dealt with believably, rather than taken for granted. Their chemistry is immediate and undeniable; it’s key in carrying off the film’s snappy dialogue and mixture of flirtatious comedy, captivating mystery, and genuine thriller. It’s His Girl Friday by way of Hitchcock. —Jenna Stoeber

Charade is available to stream on Prime Video, for free with a library card on Hoopla or Kanopy, or for free with ads on Vudu, The Roku Channel, Freevee, Tubi, and Pluto TV. It is also available for digital rental or purchase on Amazon, Apple TV, Google Play, and Vudu.

Clueless

Year: 1995

Run time: 1h 37m

Director: Amy Heckerling

Cast: Alicia Silverstone, Brittany Murphy, Paul Rudd

There have been many adaptations of Jane Austen’s Emma over the years — and many actresses taking on Jane Austen’s self-proclaimed unlikable heroine. There’s Gwyneth Paltrow in the pastel-swathed 1990s version who makes Emma haughty, yet lovable; Joanna Sotomura in the 2013 webseries Emma Approved turns the socialite into an ambitious, albeit misguided lifestyle guru; and more recently, Anya Taylor-Joy’s rendition of the character gives her a piercing mean streak worthy of the original.

All these Emmas have their own merits, but sometimes the most memorable Emma isn’t an Emma at all, but a Cher.

Clueless takes the general framework of Emma — a rich, bored young woman who just can’t stop getting involved in everyone’s business — and transports the story from Regency-era England to 1990s Beverly Hills. Emma is now Cher, played wonderfully by Alicia Silverstone, a chic, stylish, and popular high school student who thinks she knows what’s best for everyone.

The beats of Jane Austen’s original story still play out. Cher takes an unpopular new student under her wing and tries to set her up with a hot match that’ll catapult her to social fame. All those matches end up being catastrophic failures. Cher goes too far and learns a bit about herself along the way. All of it is done with bright, bold 1990s fashion and slang, with iconic quotable lines and the very best that teen movies have to offer. Come for young Paul Rudd, stay for the sentiment that stories are timeless and that human traits transcend eras (and also Cher’s digital closet). —Petrana Radulovic

Clueless is available to stream on Paramount Plus or for free with ads on Pluto TV.

Coming to America

Year: 1988

Run time: 1h 56m

Director: John Landis

Cast: Eddie Murphy, Arsenio Hall, James Earl Jones

Eddie Murphy stars in the 1988 romantic comedy Coming to America as Akeem Joffer, the crown prince of the fictional African country of Zamunda who, tired of his mother and father’s meddling in his love life, journeys to the borough of Queens in New York City with his personal aide Semmi (Arsenio Hall) to search for a wife. Directed by John Landis and based on a story by Murphy, Coming to America is packed with endlessly quotable performances by Samuel L. Jackson, James Earl Jones, Louie Anderson, John Amos, and Murphy and Arsenio in multiple roles. The movie is an absolute riot front to back and an enduring classic for good reason: It’s one of Murphy’s finest films. —Toussaint Egan

Coming to America is available to stream on Netflix, or for digital rental or purchase on Amazon, Apple TV, Google Play, and Vudu.

Don’t Go Breaking My Heart

Year: 2011

﻿Run time: 1h 55m

Director: Johnnie To, Wai Ka-fai

Cast: Louis Koo, Daniel Wu, Gao Yuanyuan

Johnnie To is one of our great modern directors, equally adept in hard-boiled triad crime dramas and light-hearted romantic comedies alike. 2011’s Don’t Go Breaking My Heart falls in the latter category, and is one of the many high marks of the Hong Kong director’s legendary career. Fresh off the end of a long-term relationship, Chi-yan (Gao Yuanyuan) is an analyst for an investment bank who finds herself in the middle of a love triangle. On one side, there’s Sean (Louis Koo), a CEO who works across the street from Chi-yan and yearns for her through the tall corporate glass windows that separate them. On the other, there’s Kevin (the always-dreamy Daniel Wu), an alcoholic former architect who helps Chi-Yan move on and is inspired by her to start creating again. What follows is a sincere, funny, and truly charming romantic time. —PV

Don’t Go Breaking My Heart is available to stream on Netflix.

Eega

Year: 2012

Run time: 2h 14m

Director: S.S. Rajamouli

Cast: Sudeepa, Nani, Samantha

One of the very best movies on Netflix, the logline for Eega will clue you in right away as to whether this movie is up your alley or not. A whirlwind slapstick comedy revenge thriller from the director of RRR and the Baahubali movies, Eega is about a man who is murdered by a romantic rival and reincarnated as a fly, teaming up with the woman he loves to exact revenge on the man who killed him. It’s joyously fun and absolutely bonkers (complimentary), with exciting action sequences, groundbreaking visual effects, and plenty of laugh-out-loud jokes. Much to its benefit, the fly in Eega is completely silent, instead pushing director Rajamouli to employ some classic tricks from silent cinema for laughs and gasps alike. —PV

Eega is available to stream on Netflix.

The Gold Rush

Year: 1925

﻿Run time: 1h 28m

Director: Charlie Chaplin

Cast: Charlie Chaplin, Georgia Hale, Mack Swain

Charlie Chaplin’s adventurous comedy is nearly 100 years old, and it absolutely still holds up for the modern sense of humor. In The Gold Rush, Chaplin’s “Little Tramp” is a prospector living on a shack in the middle of the Klondike. Extreme slapstick and farce ensue, as Little Tramp’s blown by Canadian winds, stoops to eating a leather shoe for sustenance, and eventually performs his legendary fork dance. Chaplin — even more than the muscle icons of the 1980s — is the key DNA to modern action entertainment, and if you’ve never seen one of his classics, The Gold Rush is a hilarious entry point. —Matt Patches

The Gold Rush is available to stream on Max and Criterion Channel or for free with ads on Freevee, Tubi, and Plex. It is also available for for digital rental or purchase on Amazon and Apple TV.

I Married a Witch

Year: 1942

﻿Run time: 1h 16m

Director: René Clair

Cast: Fredric March, Veronica Lake, Robert Benchley

René Clair, who made his name in early French silent and sound cinema, spent a few years making movies in the U.S. during World War II. Among them is the exemplary black-and-white romantic comedy I Married a Witch, which stars the incomparable Veronica Lake as a witch who hopes to exact revenge on the descendant of the man who imprisoned her by making him fall in love with her.

When two witches — Jennifer (Lake) and her father, Daniel (Cecil Kellaway) — are burned at the stake by Puritans in colonial Salem, they curse the man who denounced them. He and his descendants (all played by Fredric March) will be doomed to be unhappy in love, always marrying “the wrong woman.” Jennifer and Daniel awake 270 years later, and she begins pursuing her target: Wallace Wooley, the latest descendant of the man that caused her execution and also a leading candidate for governor. Oh, and his wedding to the daughter of his top political supporter is tomorrow.

With costumes by the legendary Edith Head, charming practical effects (the two witches are represented by wisps of smoke before inhabiting bodies), and plenty of hilarious gags (there’s a “popped maize” vendor during the “intermission” of the witches’ execution), I Married a Witch is a breezy 77 minutes of Classic Hollywood delight. —PV

I Married a Witch is available to stream on Max and Criterion Channel, or for digital rental or purchase on Amazon and Apple TV.

Kiss Kiss Bang Bang

Year: 2005

﻿Run time: 1h 42m

Director: Shane Black

Cast: Robert Downey Jr., Val Kilmer, Michelle Monaghan

Kiss Kiss Bang Bang is, without a doubt, one of if not the funniest and most effortlessly cool movies I have ever seen. Partially based on Brett Halliday’s 1941 novel Bodies Are Where You Find Them, Shane Black’s neo-noir black comedy crime thriller stars Robert Downey Jr. as Harry Lockhart, a petty thief who, due to a series of extraordinary circumstances, is mistaken for an actor and whisked away from the back alleys of New York to the twinkling lights of Los Angeles for a screen test. While there, Harry inadvertently finds himself ensnared in a murder mystery involving his childhood crush (Michelle Monaghan), a sarcastic private detective (Val Kilmer), and a retired actor named (Corbin Bernsen) with a terrible secret to hide.

Relentlessly meta, wickedly funny, and boasting one of the coolest opening title sequences of its time, Kiss Kiss Bang Bang is the rough-and-tumble blueprint to Black’s 2016 movie The Nice Guys, and by all degrees the better film of the two. —TE

Kiss Kiss Bang Bang is available for digital rental or purchase at Amazon, Apple, and Google Play.

The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou

Year: 2004

﻿Run time: 1h 58m

Director: Wes Anderson

Cast: Bill Murray, Owen Wilson, Cate Blanchett

Wes Anderson’s eccentric 2004 ensemble comedy is dedicated to Jacques Cousteau and is a loving (and hilarious) homage to the legendary French oceanographer. Steve Zissou (Bill Murray) is an oceanographer/documentarian who loses his best friend to a shark attack while working on his project. Zissou sets out for his next project: to find and kill the shark, and film the whole thing.

The hilarious ensemble cast includes Anjelica Huston (Zissou’s estranged wife who finances his projects), Willem Dafoe (an emotionally insecure German first mate), Owen Wilson (a Zissou super-fan who believes he is Zissou’s son), and Jeff Goldblum (playing Zissou’s rival, a more successful oceanographer). With an excellent soundtrack of Portuguese David Bowie covers by Brazilian singer-songwriter Seu Jorge and Anderson’s typical attention to detail in composition, The Life Aquatic is a cinematic feast of the senses. —PV

The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou is for free with a library card on Hoopla, or for digital rental or purchase at Amazon, Apple, and Google Play.

Little Monsters

Year: 2019

﻿Run time: 1h 34m

Director: Abe Forsythe

Cast: Lupita Nyong’o, Alexander England, Josh Gad

Director Abe Forsythe’s 2019 horror comedy Little Monsters stars Alexander England (Alien: Covenant) as Dave, a foul-mouthed and down-on-his-luck rock musician living with his sister and nephew after a rough breakup. Attempting to get on the good side of Miss Caroline (Lupita Nyong’o), his nephew’s kindergarten teacher, Dave agrees to come along and chaperone the class’ field trip to a petting zoo. Unfortunately for them, the petting zoo sits right next to a U.S. Army base that happens to be experiencing a zombie outbreak. As the class finds itself cornered by the undead horde, Dave will have to help Miss Caroline to make sure everyone gets out alive. Can he win her heart, or at the very least grow as a person for the experience? We won’t spoil it, but we will tell you Josh Gad gets attacked by zombies in the process. —TE

Little Monsters is available to stream on Hulu.

Love & Friendship

Year: 2016

﻿Run time: 1h 30m

Director: Whit Stillman

Cast: Kate Beckinsale, Xavier Samuel, Emma Greenwell

Whit Stillman’s uproarious adaptation of Jane Austen’s Lady Susan stars Kate Beckinsale in one of her richest (and most hilarious) roles. Beckinsale plays Lady Susan, a young widow looking to secure appropriate matches for both her daughter (Morfydd Clark) and herself. Susan flirts and schemes her way throughout the movie to the delight of the audience and the frustration of her suitors and friends.

Love & Friendship features terrific supporting turns by Chloë Sevigny (as Susan’s supportive best friend), Tom Bennett (playing a hilariously dense wealthy fool), and the rest of the cast, as well as Stillman’s characteristic biting dialogue and an attention to detail in sets and costuming. But the whole thing is brought together by Beckinsale’s transcendent performance, one of the more recent examples of how comedic roles get ignored during awards season. —PV

Love & Friendship is available to stream on Prime Video.

Magic Mike and Magic Mike XXL

Year: 2012 (Magic Mike); 2015 (Magic Mike XXL)

﻿Run time: 1h 50m (Magic Mike); 1h 55m (Magic Mike XXL)

Director: Steven Soderbergh (Magic Mike); Gregory Jacobs (Magic Mike XXL)

Cast: Channing Tatum, Matt Bomer, Joe Manganiello

Two joyous celebrations of bodies in motion contained within working class stories of trying to Make It Work in the face of a grueling world? Pure excellence. Channing Tatum, Joe Manganiello, and the rest of the ensemble cast soar, and both movies contain unforgettable set-pieces sure to get you off your feet.

Steven Soderbergh’s Magic Mike is an excellent subversive rom-com, inverting many standard gender tropes in the genre. The follow-up, Magic Mike XXL, is even more rapturously joyous than the first, celebrating pleasure in its many forms (in this way, you could say it is like Hellraiser without the pain). XXL also doubles as a road trip movie and a “the crew gets back together for one last job” movie. Also: Manganiello goes all out in a minimart dancing to “I Want It That Way.” Perfection, no notes. —PV

Magic Mike and Magic Mike XXL are available to stream for free with ads on Tubi, or for digital rental or purchase at Amazon, Apple, and Google Play.

Moonstruck

Year: 1987

﻿Run time: 1h 41m

Director: Norman Jewison

Cast: Cher, Nicolas Cage, Vincent Gardenia

The joy is in the smaller moments in Moonstruck. A mother cooks an egg-in-a-hole for her daughter. An older couple trades barbs with each other before the conversation shifts on a dime to expressions of eternal love. An elderly man basks in the moonlight with his five adorable dogs.

A widow (Cher) is convinced her ill-fated first marriage was doomed by bad luck after a hasty engagement and wedding. When a suitor (Danny Aiello) proposes, she accepts, but ends up falling for his estranged brother (Nicolas Cage) instead.

With warm sets that feel lived-in, loving depictions of food (the egg-in-a-hole has since been colloquially dubbed “Moonstruck Eggs”) and romance, hilarious family conversations (“Old man, you give another plate of my food to those dogs, I’m going to kick you till you’re dead!”), and complementary lead performances by an assured Cher and an intense Cage, Moonstruck is a touching, uproarious romantic comedy about superstition, love, and family. —PV

Moonstruck is available to stream for free with ads on Pluto TV, Tubi, and The Roku Channel, with a library card on Hoopla, or for digital rental or purchase at Amazon, Apple, and Google Play.

Multiple Maniacs

Year: 1970

﻿Run time: 1h 31m

Director: John Waters

Cast: Divine, David Lochary, Mary Vivian Pearce

The early transgressive comedies of John Waters have been anointed by Criterion as art, and one can only imagine what Waters circa 1970 would make of that. Multiple Maniacs, the provocateur’s second film, is just batshit nutso, constructing a flimsy scenario in which Lady Divine (Waters’ go-to collaborator) spirals out of control on a murder spree and her ex-lover (David Lochary) plots to kill her first with other members of Waters’ Dreamlander acting troupe. In true Waters fashion, the plot is an excuse for bodily fluid expulsion, flamboyant performance, and a moment of backdoor penetration courtesy of a sacred religious object. Today, with scrutiny from every side of the ideological spectrum, it would be almost impossible to do what Waters pulled off back in the ’70s. Criterion knew what it was doing preserving these jaw-dropping memories. —MP

Multiple Maniacs is available to stream on HBO Max and Criterion Channel, for free with ads on Tubi, or for digital rental or purchase at Amazon and Google Play.

The Paper Tigers

Year: 2020

﻿Run time: 1h 48m

Director: Bao Tran (Tran Quoc Bao)

Cast: Alain Uy, Ron Yuan, Mykel Shannon Jenkins

Tran Quoc Bao’s kung fu action comedy stars Alain Uy, Ron Yuan (Mulan), and Mykel Shannon Jenkins as the eponymous Paper Tigers: three former martial arts prodigies who, after a lifetime of strenuous training and hard fighting, have grown into beleaguered middle-aged nobodies. But when their master is murdered, the three swear an oath to avenge his memory and bring his killer to justice. If that sounds serious, please know this falls into the Apatowian camp of Dumb Man comedy. —TE

The Paper Tigers is available to stream for free with ads on Tubi, for free with a library card on Hoopla and Kanopy, or for digital rental or purchase at Amazon, Apple, and Google Play.

Plus One

Year: 2019

﻿Run time: 1h 39m

Directors: Jeff Chan, Andrew Rhymer

Cast: Maya Erskine, Jack Quaid

Netflix may be cranking out romantic comedies, but the best still come from a more personal, filmmaker-driven place. Plus One, from Pen15 writers Jeff Chan and Andrew Rhymer, premiered at the Tribeca Film Festival before quietly settling into a place on streaming and has been largely overlooked. Don’t miss it: Maya Erskine (Pen15) and Jack Quaid (The Boys) star as best buds who’ve seen all of their friends get hitched and have become go-to plus ones for the endless marathon of nuptials. Formula works to the movie’s advantage, finding sweet humor in modern situations and wringing Erskine and Quaid for every drip of charisma they have to offer. A gem that could easily been mistaken as product in our current era of rom-coms. —MP

Plus One is available to stream for free with a library card on Hoopla, for free with ads on Tubi, or for digital rental or purchase at Amazon, Apple, and Google Play.

Singin’ in the Rain

Year: 1952

﻿Run time: 1h 42m

Directors: Gene Kelly, Stanley Donen

Cast: Gene Kelly, Donald O’Connor, Debbie Reynolds

What is there to say about one of the most well-loved movies of all time? I’ll tell you this: If Singin’ in the Rain wasn’t on this list, we wouldn’t be doing our jobs right.

Stanley Donen and Gene Kelly’s timeless 1952 classic is as joyous and funny as you remember — Donald O’Connor’s “Make ’Em Laugh” bit will leave you in stitches — but it’s probably a bit stranger, too. In addition to all the industry jokes and the contemplation on the addition of sound to movies, the 13-minute dream sequence “Broadway Melody” is absolutely hypnotizing. —PV

Singin’ in the Rain is available to stream on Max, or for digital rental or purchase at Amazon, Apple, and Google Play.

Spy

Year: 2015

﻿Run time: 2h

Director: Paul Feig

Cast: Melissa McCarthy, Rose Byrne, Jason Statham

As the biggest blockbusters in the world have become more and more comedy-oriented, there’s been less space for true comedies in theaters. Spy is the rare exception, and it’s finally more broadly available to watch at home after its addition to the Max catalog.

A sendup of espionage movies from director Paul Feig (Bridesmaids, Freaks and Geeks), it stars a pitch-perfect Melissa McCarthy as a desk worker for the CIA who is forced into active duty when her partner (Jude Law) is killed by the daughter of an arms dealer (Rose Byrne, who is positively delightful in this). Add in scene-stealing turns from Jason Statham as an overconfident Bond parody, Allison Janney as McCarthy’s skeptical boss, and appearances by Bobby Cannavale, Peter Serafinowicz, and Miranda Hart, and you’ve got a rollicking good time (with terrific action shot by Day Shift director J.J. Perry). —PV

Spy is available to stream on Max, or for digital rental or purchase on Amazon, Apple TV, Google Play, and Vudu.

Support the Girls

Year: 2018

﻿Run time: 1h 33m

Director: Andrew Bujalski

Cast: Regina Hall, Haley Lu Richardson, James Le Gros

This terrific day-in-the-life comedy from writer-director Andrew Bujalski (Computer Chess) follows the manager (Regina Hall) of a Hooters-like sports bar as she deals with training new hires, rude customers crossing lines, and an idiotic boss, all the while trying to take care of her girls through various major and minor crises.

Hall, one of the great performers of our time, gives a tremendously layered performance in one of the richest roles she’s had the opportunity to play. Hall’s Lisa is a protective force in the lives of her girls, able to put on a brave face in front of them (and in support of them) even when the circumstances around them seem on the verge of a total spiral. Haley Lu Richardson (as the peppy Maci) and Shayna “Junglepussy” McHayle (as the no-nonsense Danyelle) stand out among the movie’s many great supporting turns.

Funny, heartwarming, and undeniably tangible in its ground-level depiction of a hectic workplace, Support the Girls is a movie about looking out for each other in a trying world. There’s nothing wrong with that. —PV

Support the Girls is available to stream on Prime Video, Hulu, The Criterion Channel, for free with a library card on Kanopy or Hoopla, for free with ads on The Roku Channel, or for digital rental or purchase at Amazon, Apple, and Google Play.

Tampopo

Year: 1985

﻿Run time: 1h 54m

Director: Juzo Itami

Cast: Tsutomu Yamazaki, Nobuko Miyamoto, Kōji Yakusho

This 1985 “ramen western” is a hilarious romp that also happens to be one of the most gorgeous depictions of food ever put on screen. When a pair of truck drivers stop at a run-down ramen shop, they befriend the widowed owner and help her turn the restaurant's fortunes around. A lovely story of community, passion, and human nature all filtered through the appreciation of good food, Tampopo is a cinematic feast. —PV

Tampopo is available to stream on Max and Criterion Channel, or for digital rental or purchase at Amazon, Apple, and Google Play.

To Be or Not to Be

Year: 1942

﻿Run time: 1h 39m

Director: Ernst Lubitsch

Cast: Carole Lombard, Jack Benny, Robert Stack

Ernst Lubitsch’s 1942 masterpiece is an uproarious and touching anti-war story about a group of actors who use their theatrical skills to dupe a group of Nazi soldiers in occupied Warsaw. Superstar acting couple Joseph (Jack Benny) and Maria Tura (Carole Lombard) run a theater planning to put on a performance of “Gestapo,” a comedic play satirizing Hitler. But when Germany invades and a Nazi spy schemes to give a list of secret identities of Resistance fighters to the Nazis, the troupe uses every theater trick in the book to outmaneuver the Nazis (including a visiting Hitler himself) and do their part in the war effort.

With hilarious repeated gags, disguises galore, and a rock-solid emotional foundation of a group of people trying to look out for each other in the face of evil, To Be or Not to Be is a high mark in the history of American cinema and one of my personal favorite movies ever made. —PV

To Be or Not to Be is available to stream on Max and Criterion Channel.

The Unauthorized Bash Brothers Experience

Year: 2019

﻿Run time: 30m

Director: Mike Diva, Akiva Schaffer

Cast: Andy Samberg, Akiva Schaffer

The Lonely Island dropped this musical movie — a spoof of Beyoncé’s Lemonade focused on Jose Canseco and Mark McGwire’s notorious 1980s home run streak — out of nowhere in 2019. It deserves more love.

In line with their previous efforts, like Tour de Pharmacy and 7 Days in Hell (co-starring Kit Harington!), The Unauthorized Bash Brothers Experience explores the shared psyche of Canseco and McGwire through poetry, abstract imagery, and profane lyrics. Alana Haim, Maya Rudolph, Hannah Simone, Jenny Slate, Jim O’Heir, and Sterling K. Brown — as Sia — all appear. Surprisingly, Andy Samberg and Akiva Schaffer don’t skimp on the darkness of the Bash Brothers. With lyrics like “Stab that needle in my ass until I am rich / Make me a god with the chemical sciences,” the Unauthorized Bash Brothers Experience eventually finds McGwire begging a vision of his father to save his life as Canseco raps about how therapy is for the weak. —MP

The Unauthorized Bash Brothers Experience is available to stream on Netflix.

Wheels on Meals

Year: 1984

﻿Run time: 1h 38m

Director: Sammo Hung

Cast: Jackie Chan, Sammo Hung, Yuen Biao

Few creative teams have ever managed the consistent level of excellence that Jackie Chan, Sammo Hung, and Yuen Biao did with their Hong Kong martial arts action comedies in the 1980s, and Wheels on Meals is one of the best of an outrageously good group of movies (and my personal favorite). Set and shot in Barcelona, the movie centers on Thomas (Chan) and David (Yuen), a pair of cousins who run a food truck (with skateboarding tricks to boot) and find themselves enamored with a local woman (Lola Forner). When they run into a somewhat incompetent private investigator (Sammo Hung) who is also looking for the woman, the group bands together to save her when she is suddenly kidnapped.

Wheels on Meals features some of the very best fight scenes of Jackie Chan’s prolific filmography, as he squares off against legendary kickboxer Benny Urquidez (the two would later fight again in Dragons Forever), who at the time was among the most prominent and successful fighters in the world. The whole movie is worth your time, but if you want to just find their six-minute marathon fight session on YouTube, there are few things better in this world.

If you like this, you should also check out Project A, which came out a year before and features one of the most daring and jaw-dropping stunts of Chan’s illustrious career. —PV

entertainment,Annabel Streets,2023-10-10T09:00:35+00:00,"Parenting no longer starts and stops with our children. Nor is it confined to those who have children. In a time of unrelenting change and ever-extending life, most of us will – at some stage – find ourselves “parenting” our own parents.

Indeed, many of us – particularly those who had families later – will find ourselves simultaneously parenting our kids and our parents. In one breath we’ll be begging our children to swap French fries for vegetables, and in the next breath we’ll be urging our parents to exchange cake for sardines. Little wonder today’s midlifers are known as the sandwich generation.

The relentless pace of technology – accelerated by the Covid-19 pandemic – has made everything infinitely more complicated, leaving many older (and not-so-old) people baffled and frustrated. In the last few years I’ve witnessed friends and family dashing to help parents with poorly designed online banking systems, unruly fridge alarms, “upgraded” software that has changed beyond recognition, apps and phones that don’t function as expected, and numerous other technical challenges.

Frankly, technology is often baffling to me, too. Luckily I have kids who delight in parenting me – advising, explaining and guiding me on all things digital. But studies suggest that this helpfulness might not be as beneficial as we think. Grappling with new and baffling things forces the ageing brain to work in novel ways. A recent study from the University of Texas involving more than 200 elderly adults found that those who engaged with technology had better cognition and memory than their non-engaging peers.

Digital engagement – whatever the device – protects the brain

Even the stress we experience while battling with our computer can be helpful, sharpening our mental acuity. The study authors concluded that digital engagement – whatever the device – protects the brain. These findings reflect earlier studies that discovered that older people who made active use of technology were less likely to get dementia.

Dr Eamon Laird, researcher in health and ageing at Limerick university, agrees that we should be encouraging older parents to try new things. And the further out of their comfort zone they feel, the better. “It’s always good to keep the mind active and fresh,” he told me. “New challenges can help build and maintain new brain connections and can be good for brain and overall health.”

If older people use technology to keep in touch with extended family and friends, that’s a double whammy. When my 84-year-old mother recently joined Instagram, she not only expanded her grey matter but she also found an effective means of staying in touch with her grandchildren. Being social, says Laird, is as important as trying new things: “Research shows that those who are more social are also more resilient to chronic conditions and often have a stronger immune system.”

Anyone with older parents should be urging them out for a walk five days a week Dr Eamon Laird, health and ageing researcher

Depression among the elderly is on the rise and often goes unnoticed. Gerontologists now believe that it is one of the most common psychiatric disorders among the elderly – with half of all cases going undiagnosed. When elderly parents become depressed (many of them come from a generation not accustomed to talking about their mental health), it can be difficult to know how to respond. But Laird’s latest report suggests that a daily walk could help. His study of more than 4,000 older adults found that as little as 20 minutes of daily walking could cut the risk of depression by up to 43%. “Anyone with older parents should be urging them out for a walk five days a week – and when they have a companion, the walk also doubles as a social occasion,” he explained. “If they can walk for longer than 20 minutes, even better. Our study showed that the risk of depression fell in proportion to the time spent walking.”

As well as a daily walk, Laird recommends vitamin D and B12 supplements – both of which appear to moderate the chance of depression in older people. “Depression matters,” he added. “Not just because it reduces quality of life, but because in older people there seems to be a link between depression and dementia which we’re still unpacking.”

Health coach Susan Saunders found herself “parenting” her mother (who had dementia) while her own daughters were babies. “I’d advise anyone with a parent in the early stages of dementia to investigate all the available research trials. Start by joining Dementia Research, a nationwide register that matches volunteers to research programmes.”

Even if your parents don’t require such intensive “parenting”, a simple supplement could help. A recent study from Columbia University involving 2,200 adults aged 60 and over found that an inexpensive multivitamin formulated specifically for older people improved cognition, memory and focus. In fact, the results were so marked that the researchers said the supplement could slow age-related memory decline by three years.

But while most of us can probably persuade our parents to take a multivitamin, suggesting they change their diet might be more complicated. Appetites fade as we age, chewing becomes more difficult and those living alone don’t always feel inclined to cook. The important thing, say both Saunders and Laird, is that older people consume plenty of protein.

“Older adults should be taking at least 1 to 1.5g of protein per kilogram of body weight,” says Laird. “Dairy, fish or non-processed meat can help maintain muscle strength and function, reducing the risk of frailty as we age.”

In truth, anyone over 50 would do well to follow these simple guidelines: engage with something new every day, take a daily walk of at least 20 minutes, socialise regularly, take a daily multivitamin for seniors and check the protein content of our meals. Perhaps we should think of it as self-parenting.

entertainment,Chris Plante,2023-10-18T13:00:00+00:00,"The second level of Super Mario Bros. Wonder is a musical. Or, to be precise, it can be a musical. Whether or not the universe breaks into song depends on which words of the title “Super Mario Bros. Wonder” you prefer.

If you’re here for the “Super Mario Bros.” of it all, this level (and every level) can be enjoyed as a loyal continuation of the plumber’s work in the 2D platformer genre that has maintained a healthy and consistent cadence since the series debuted in 1985. Dash from left to right, jump over pits, concuss enemies, collect the occasional power-up, and after a few minutes of adventuring ever eastward, leap onto the flagpole that ends one level and unlocks the next.

But, if you’re curious about the “Wonder” — if you’re not too precious about video game tradition — you can find within each Wonder stage a Wonder Seed, a Mario-sized ball of botany that morphs the environment into something indeed quite wonderful. Like a musical number.

To choose wonder is to flood the atmosphere with lava-lamp plasma, send gravity into convulsions, or transform your hero into any variety of creatures — or even inanimate objects. As my stoned college roommate once postulated while ripping an apple bong: “You always see the scenery, but have you ever wanted to be the scenery?” Reader, he dreamt so we could live. For a moment, Mario gets to be the background.

The brilliance of Super Mario Bros. Wonder is that the choice is one of “and,” not of “or.” The traditional and the topsy-turvy coexist. Across six worlds, the creators of Wonder offer a menu of familiar stages that, should you like, can be prepared with extra spice — or paired with the family-friendly equivalent of ayahuasca. That particular drug comparison isn’t flippant: At one point Toad licks the ol’ Wonder Seed, and suddenly he’s riding a dragon.

Wonder Seeds can add a splash of difficulty, but help is perpetually available in a fashion that’s considerate rather than patronizing. Gone are time limits. Extra lives can be purchased at a low cost with the game’s abundant purple currency. A new badge system allows players to select from a growing collection of special abilities that range from helpful (a high, floating leap) to playful (a Piranha Plant grappling hook) to silly (a triple jump tied to a musical rhythm).

Prince charming Badges are worn by a little royal bug named Prince Florian who joins you on your journey and provides the majority of conversation on this road trip, alongside very talkative flowers sprouting across every corner of the Flower Kingdom, eager to provide a tip for a metatextual wink.

Each unlockable upgrade or special move is assigned to a badge that can be found or purchased. One collected badge can be selected before each stage, so I found myself rotating abilities based on need. For example, when later stages added a bunch of instant-death bottomless pits, I opted for the Safety Bounce badge: When I plunge into an abyss, the darkness spits me up like a piece of hamburger caught in its throat.

I expect many players will brag that their favorite badge is the “overpowered one,” which is sort of always true. No matter what you use, you will feel like you’ve been given an unfair advantage as you casually float over chunks of the stage or vacuum coins through walls. To maintain balance, the designers layered on new challenges, keeping Wonder within the Goldilocks window. Not too hard, not too easy. Just right.

The wonder of playing Super Mario Bros. in 1985 came from the discovery. Nintendo not only predicted players would climb outside the confines of the level, it placed shortcuts in the hidden crevices to reward the most rule-breaking players. Badges cleverly build upon that sense of freedom with skills that let you soar over towering enemies or use that Piranha Plant grappling hook to climb high above the confines of the stage — now a Mario tradition.

And sometimes Wonder goes further. With Wonder Seeds, the levels themselves collapse and contort, disobeying the laws established by decades of Mario games. Giant, sudsy, rainbow-tinted bubbles fill a stage and burst through the ceiling; a colossal snowball knocks down a flagpole, extending the stage beyond its official conclusion.

This is the most significant difference between 1985 and 2023: Mario’s creators have joined in the fun of breaking the machine.

Play Mario for the first time a second time

Middle-aged Mario fans (read: me) have speculated since its announcement that Wonder could be the first “true new Mario game” since Super Mario World in 1990.

To younger (or just less obsessive) readers, that theory might sound strange. Nintendo has released many iterative entries of Mario — including the cheekily named New Super Mario Bros. series. However, for the village elders, the first four 2D Mario games stand apart.

Mario multiplayer Wonder shines as a solo experience, but like other recent 2D Mario games, Wonder allows up to four players to play together. Multiplayer is both a delight and utter chaos. The humanoid characters (Mario, Peach, Toad, etc.) are like M&Ms — they have different exteriors but effectively play the same. The critters are perfect for players who prefer a little extra help. Nabbit and Yoshi won’t take damage, and the Yoshis have their familiar tongue attack and floaty jump.

With each Super Mario Bros. on the NES and SNES, Nintendo’s designers learned from the previous entry, cutting what didn’t work, making audacious additions (there was a time when adding a dinosaur named Yoshi felt like a gimmick!), and gradually accumulating the pieces and tropes that would appear in every game for the following 30-plus years.

Then, with Super Mario 64, 3D Mario games became the de facto labs for Nintendo’s greatest experimentation: Magical hats! Water guns! Galactic travel! 2D Mario, conversely, defaulted to a vessel for nostalgia.

I can say with confidence that Wonder shares those early games’ inventiveness, and their disregard for what should and shouldn’t be in a Mario game. When playing Wonder, I’ve imagined how it came to be: In my fantasy, since the ’90s, every time a Nintendo developer had an idea that “didn’t fit the tone” or “wasn’t Mario enough,” they wrote it into a notebook. And eventually, with no space left, someone had the gall to say, “Let’s turn this stuffed notebook of chaos into a game. Because why shouldn’t Mario be an elephant? Why shouldn’t Wigglers wear roller skates? And why shouldn’t Luigi skydive?”

Wonder’s creators have so many new ideas to share that their creativity is unapologetically wasteful, which I say as a compliment. Many gimmicks in Super Mario Bros. Wonder could be stretched to fill entire games, but here, we’re lucky to see them last a few minutes.

For example, one stage might feature platforms that drop when you step on them. The next stage will feature platforms that drop, but only after you’ve jumped on them a certain number of times — a countdown clock at their center. After that, the stage will have platforms made of batteries, each dropping as it runs out of energy. And then, to wrap things up, there will be a stage in which you build the stage out of huge batteries of different shapes, the platform rapidly growing and shrinking as it skims above a yawning abyss.

In the current era of AAA “forever games” filled with endless lists of chores and artificial rewards, Wonder’s willingness to juice each idea of its fun, then toss the rind in the trash, is a potent alternative. The reward isn’t XP or limited-edition outfits. It’s the play itself.

Don’t mistake the creative abundance (and refusal to wear out one’s welcome) for a short game. Levels are everywhere. Wonder’s map features six worlds, but levels can also be found in the hub area, along with... to avoid spoilers, let’s just say elsewhere. The familiar rhythms of a Mario game have been broken, with bosses appearing without warning, some worlds ending with no boss fight at all, and the occasional surprise stage that materializes like a mirage.

Whether or not Super Mario Bros. Wonder is the unofficial Super Mario Bros. 5 that dorks like me have long wanted, I’ll leave to the forums. But I will say this: What a joy it is to play a Mario game and not already know how to read it, to not have my muscle memory do more work than my brain.

With rumors that the Nintendo Switch’s successor could arrive early next year, I would be fine if Wonder were this console’s last big release. To survive after the Wii U, Nintendo had to bring together its console and handheld designers and create something unlike anything on the market, without sacrificing what had gotten the company to that point. As the sun sets on the Switch, after an unprecedented run of success, along with arguably the best entries in many of the company’s biggest franchises, we get Super Mario Bros. Wonder.

Like the Switch itself, Wonder is a collision between the traditional and the new. A game that’s the same as it ever was and nothing like Mario has ever been.
