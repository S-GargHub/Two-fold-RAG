sports,"Colum Dell, Yardbarker",2023-12-24T23:34:39+00:00,"Christmas Day isn't just for the NBA, as the NFL is set to air an exciting triple-header featuring fierce division clashes and a highly anticipated matchup we could see again on Super Bowl Sunday. Here are the top players and storylines to monitor for Monday's slate.

Las Vegas Raiders (6-8) at Kansas City Chiefs (9-5) | 1 p.m. ET

New chapter in Patrick Mahomes-Maxx Crosby rivalry: This hasn't been as much of a rivalry between the teams as of late, with Kansas City holding a 10-1 record over the Raiders since Mahomes became its starting quarterback. Yet it has sparked an exciting feud between the two-time Super Bowl MVP and the two-time Pro Bowler Crosby, who has five sacks in nine career games against the Chiefs.

Mahomes and Crosby might not like facing one another, though it's clear there's mutual respect between the two, which only makes their rivalry more intriguing to watch.

Can Raiders QB Aidan O’Connell earn next season’s starting job?: After leading the offense on seven touchdown scoring drives in last week's 63-21 win over the Chargers, the rookie fourth-rounder aims to further establish himself as a serious contender for Las Vegas' starting job next season. Despite the encouraging performance, O'Connell has been inconsistent across six games as the full-time starter, throwing for 1,300 yards, seven touchdowns, and five interceptions.

However, a stellar showing against the NFL's fifth-ranked pass defense (202.5 yards per game allowed) would benefit his bid to be the starter in 2024.

Chiefs TE Travis Kelce: Yes, his girlfriend will be in town for the holiday. Kelce is averaging 89.6 yards per game with global popstar Taylor Swift in attendance this season but is coming off his worst outing in her presence, catching five passes for 28 yards.

Even so, Kelce's 81.3 average receiving yards per game against the Raiders since 2019 suggests the All-Pro tight end is in line for a productive outing and could potentially snap his four-game scoring drought.

New York Giants (5-9) at Philadelphia Eagles (10-4) | 4:30 p.m. ET

Will the Eagles defense shake off the rust?: Appointing Matt Patricia as defensive play-caller didn't change much for the Eagles, whose defense has given up the third-most points in the NFL over their current three-game losing streak (95). Although the unit has reached its lowest point, there are reasons to be optimistic about Monday's matchup.

New York ranks 31st among teams in points and yards per game this season and has surrendered a staggering 76 sacks, the third-most in a single season in NFL history. Not to mention, the annual trip to Philadelphia has essentially been a scheduled loss for the Giants, with their last win at Lincoln Financial Field coming in 2013.

Can QB Jalen Hurts and the Eagles offense finally bounce back?: Philadelphia's defense isn't the only unit that needs to rebound, as the offense has struggled mightily over the last three games, with Hurts' ineffectiveness playing a significant role. After averaging the third-most points in the NFL over the first 11 games (28.2), the Eagles have scored four offensive touchdowns during their current skid, three of which came via the ""tush push.""

The Eagles may have difficulty throwing against a solid Giants pass defense, though they could alleviate some of their offensive woes by running the ball efficiently. New York gives up 131.6 rushing yards per game, the fourth-most in the league.

Does Giants QB Tommy DeVito have any magic left?: The Giants may have a terrible offense, but this unit has operated at its best under DeVito, an undrafted rookie and native of Cedar Grove, New Jersey.

DeVito has thrown for 858 yards, seven touchdowns, and one interception in five games since being named New York's starting quarterback, posting the 13th-highest passer rating in the NFL during that stretch (97.3).

Baltimore Ravens (11-3) at San Francisco 49ers (11-3) | 8:15 p.m. ET

Potential Super Bowl sneak peek and MVP implications: Easily the most hyped game of the week, with the top seed in each respective conference squaring off in what could be a potential Super Bowl LVIII preview as well as the decisive clash for the MVP Award.

According to oddschecker, 49ers QB Brock Purdy is listed as the heavy favorite to be named league MVP (-230), while Baltimore signal-caller Lamar Jackson holds the second-shortest odds (+525).

Purdy, the final pick of the 2022 NFL Draft, has seen his career unfold as if it were a fairy tale that just keeps getting more remarkable. The 23-year-old ranks first in the NFL in QBR (76) and touchdown passes (29) while ranking third in passing yards (3,795), all of which are especially impressive considering he's coming off offseason elbow surgery.

Jackson might not be posting the ridiculous numbers he did during his 2019 MVP campaign, but the adjustment in his play style in his first season under OC Todd Monken has led to sustainable, winning football. Nevertheless, Baltimore needs an upset win for Jackson to capture another MVP Award, as he has thrown for 3,105 yards and 17 touchdowns while adding 741 yards on the ground with five scores this season.

49ers RB Christian McCaffrey: If Purdy wasn't playing at such a high level — and the MVP wasn't a quarterback-driven award — it'd be difficult to argue against McCaffrey taking home the honors. McCaffrey, who seems poised to win the Offensive Player of the Year Award, leads the NFL in rushing (1,292 yards) and total yards per game (128.6) this season and is tied for first in touchdowns (20).

Ravens TE Isaiah Likely thriving in the starting role: The Ravens offense hasn't lost a step since losing one of the team's top weapons in tight end Mark Andrews (ankle) in Week 11, largely due to Likely's emergence.

The second-year tight end has averaged 64.3 yards over his last three games, which is particularly noteworthy since Andrews averaged 54.4 yards per game before sustaining his injury.

Should we expect a defensive battle?: While both teams boast offenses that rank in the top five in yardage and scoring, this may not turn into a shootout. The Ravens defense has allowed the fewest points per game this season (16.1) and second-fewest total yards (4,030), while San Francisco's unit ranks second in points (16.7) and 10th in yardage (310 per game).

The 49ers defense might be slightly inferior statistically, but it could have more of an impact in this matchup. San Francisco has racked up an NFL-leading 25 turnovers and has given up the second-fewest rushing yards (1,252), which should help slow down the team with the league's most effective running game.","Christmas Day preview: 49ers, Ravens square off in potential Super Bowl sneak peek",https://www.yardbarker.com/nfl/articles/christmas_day_preview_49ers_ravens_square_off_in_potential_super_bowl_sneak_peek/s1_13132_39720250,Yardbarker
sports,Dan Treacy,2023-10-30T22:20:03+00:00,"The Lions just needed to get themselves back in the win column after a blowout loss in Baltimore, and they did just that in front of their home fans on Monday night.

Detroit rolled to a 26-14 victory over the Raiders in a game that felt much more one-sided than the score indicates.

The Lions thoroughly outplayed the Raiders, out-gaining Las Vegas by 329 yards, but critical mistakes by Detroit left points on the board. The offense struggled to turn red zone opportunities into touchdowns in the first half, and two turnovers deep in Raiders territory -- including a pick-six by Jared Goff -- kept Las Vegas in the game in the second half.

MORE: What to know about Lions' retro 'Honolulu blue' helmets

Nonetheless, the Lions' defense dominated. The Raiders were abysmal on the offensive side of the ball, outside of a second-quarter touchdown drive led by Josh Jacobs. Jimmy Garoppolo completed just 10 passes, badly missing a wide-open Davante Adams on multiple occasions.

Adams was seen slamming his helmet down on the sideline in the fourth quarter, and it's tough to blame the star receiver after an 11-yard performance that could have been exponentially better with better quarterback play.

The story of the night was Lions rookie Jahmyr Gibbs, who finally broke through after entering the season with sky-high expectations. Tasked with leading the backfield in David Montgomery's absence, Gibbs exploded for 189 scrimmage yards and a touchdown in the win. It was the first 100-yard rushing performance of his career.

Meanwhile, Amon-Ra St. Brown notched his third consecutive 100-yard game despite entering Monday as questionable with an illness.

The Lions enter their bye in sole possession of the No. 2 seed in the NFC, while the Raiders drop their second consecutive game against an NFC North opponent and have what might be a must-win game against the Giants in Week 9 if they want any chance to linger in the AFC playoff race.

Raiders vs. Lions results, highlights from 'Monday Night Football'

(All times Eastern)

Final: Lions 26, Raiders 14

11:15 p.m. — That'll do it! The Lions bounce back and move to 6-2 with the win over Las Vegas. Detroit left points on the board, but the Raiders were thoroughly outplayed in this one.

11:09 p.m. — The Lions get the ball back and will try to ice the game at this point.

11:08 p.m. — Adding insult to injury, Garoppolo is sacked for the sixth time tonight. It's 4th & 17.

11:07 p.m. — Davante Adams has had his way with Cameron Sutton at times tonight, and Garoppolo has just not made the throw each time. It happens again here on what would've been a game-changing play. Garoppolo has had a brutal night.

11:04 p.m. — Riley Patterson missed a 26-yard field goal attempt after making his first four attempts tonight. Strange. The Lions can't come away with points on that drive.

11:01 p.m. — What would've been a Reynolds touchdown is erased by a holding penalty. That does give the Lions a chance to erase some more time on the clock, though.

11:00 p.m. — Craig Reynolds, up to 66 yards, has the Lions on the verge of the end zone.

10:58 p.m. — Garoppolo is sacked AGAIN. It's Anzalone for the second time on the drive, and that sends the ball right back to the Lions.

10:56 p.m. — Now the Lions sack Garoppolo on back-to-back plays as Alex Anzalone and Alim McNeill come in to send the Raiders to 3rd & 28.

10:53 p.m. — Garoppolo hits Jakobi Meyers for a big 19 yards to give the Raiders something to work with.

10:51 p.m. — The Garoppolo-to-Adams connection is just not working tonight. Adams was all by himself downfield, and Garoppolo throws it well out of bounds.

Lions 26, Raiders 14

10:46 p.m. FIELD GOAL — 52 yards? No problem for Patterson, who extends the Lions' lead to 12.

10:45 p.m. — Kalif Raymond was set up for a big play, but Goff's throw was just a bit behind him. That will get Riley Patterson on the field for a 52-yard field goal try.

10:43 p.m. — Goff gets pushed forward on 4th & 1 to keep the Lions' drive alive. They're into Raiders territory, trying to ice this game.

10:36 p.m. — Gibbs is just wearing down this Raiders defense for chunks of yards. He's up to 179 scrimmage yards and has the Lions moving down the field again.

End of third quarter: Lions 23, Raiders 14

10:32 p.m. — Gibbs turns what looked like little or no gain into a first down. He has 126 yards on the ground.

10:31 p.m. — Alim McNeill sacks Garoppolo for an 8-yard loss, ending Las Vegas' drive. Aside from the second quarter drive dominated by Jacobs, the Raiders' offense has shown nothing tonight. Garoppolo has just 62 yards through nearly three quarters.

10:28 p.m. — Michael Mayer gets the Raiders' drive started with a big 19-yard gain. That's the rookie's first catch of the night.

Lions 23, Raiders 14

10:25 p.m. TOUCHDOWN — There goes Jahmyr Gibbs! It's the rookie's night. He takes off for a 27-yard touchdown with his blazing speed and has 149 scrimmage yards on the night. More importantly, he gives the Lions a two-possession lead.

10:23 p.m. — A pass interference call gives the Lions 18 yards and takes them well into Raiders territory after starting the drive with strong field position.

10:18 p.m. — The Lions quickly get the Raiders off the field, and a bad drop by Davante Adams on third down is the culprit. The throw was a bit low, but Adams still had it in his grasp for a second. Las Vegas will punt.

10:16 p.m. — It was hard to find a conclusive angle of what happened there, but Lions fans are making it known they think Reynolds was down. It doesn't matter. It's Raiders ball with a chance for Las Vegas to take the lead.

10:13 p.m. FUMBLE — For now, the Raiders force a fumble by Reynolds and instantly end the Lions' drive. Maxx Crosby ripped it right out of his arms. Was he down? That's what officials are taking a closer look at.

10:11 p.m. — Another first down by Gibbs, who has 116 scrimmage yards, and the Lions have 1st & Goal.

10:09 p.m. — Officials come out to measure whether Craig Reynolds got a first down...and he did. On the next play, Reynolds catches a pass from Goff for 12 yards. The Lions are in business on the verge of the red zone.

10:06 p.m. — The Lions have gotten over midfield with two early first downs as they try to steal the momentum back. St. Brown is up to 108 yards on the night.

Lions 16, Raiders 14

10:01 p.m. PICK-SIX — Marcus Peters picks off Goff and runs it 74 yards back for the touchdown! Amon-Ra St. Brown didn't have his eye on the throw from Goff, but Peters did. The Raiders are right back in this game.

10:00 p.m. — There goes Jahmyr Gibbs! The rookie breaks tackles for a bruising 24-yard run. He's up to 97 scrimmage yards tonight.

9:56 p.m. — Julian Okwara sacks Garoppolo on third down, forcing a Raiders punt. The Lions didn't want to let Las Vegas build any momentum to start the half, and mission accomplished.

9:55 p.m. — It's quickly 3rd & 9 to start this third quarter after Davante Adams unsuccessfully looks for a pass interference call.

End of first half: Lions 16, Raiders 7

9:39 p.m. — The Raiders run one play but elect to go to the half. They'll start the second half with the ball and could use at least some points on that drive if they want to stay in this game.

Lions 16, Raiders 7

9:36 p.m. TOUCHDOWN — LaPorta's great rookie season rolls on! The rookie picks up his fourth touchdown of the season and extends the Lions' lead. Detroit found success running the ball early, but that drive featured nice work from Goff. 16-7. Lions.

9:35 p.m. — LaPorta picks up a first down for the Lions, and now Dan Campbell is going to start using his timeouts with 31 seconds left in the half. Detroit is at the Raiders' 18-yard line.

9:33 p.m. — St. Brown picks up another first down for the Lions as they enter field goal range again. St. Brown is up to 94 yards in the first half after entering the day listed as questionable.

9:30 p.m. — What would've been a horsecollar penalty on a nice Gibbs run is offset by a holding call. The fans don't like it.

9:26 p.m. — There's a welcomed sight for Lions fans: Goff hits Jameson Williams for a 22-yard gain. Williams was held without a catch despite six targets in Baltimore last week.

9:25 p.m. — Crosby is doing so much more than just getting to the quarterback tonight. He wraps up Gibbs, the third time tonight he's had an explosive play on a ball-carrier.

9:21 p.m. TOUCHDOWN — That was a statement drive by the Raiders. Jacobs looked like the dominant runner he was last season and takes it in himself for the game's first touchdown.

9:20 p.m. — Davante Adams doesn't have a single catch tonight, but Jacobs has 12 touches. Right now, it's starting to work. The Raiders are set up with 1st & Goal.

9:19 p.m. — The Raiders are quickly into the red zone after another nice gain for Josh Jacobs.

9:17 p.m. — Las Vegas' offense is moving much smoother now as Austin Hooper picks up another first down. Hooper has two catches on this drive.

9:15 p.m. — It's back-to-back first downs for the Raiders, with the help of a 15-yard penalty on Aidan Hutchinson for a low block.

Lions 9, Raiders 0

9:11 p.m. FIELD GOAL — The Lions' drive fizzles almost instantly, so it's back to Riley Patterson's leg for another field goal. Detroit leads, 9-0.

9:09 p.m. — Momentum swings abound. St. Brown comes right back with a 24-yard catch to make up the lost yardage and much more.

9:08 p.m. — Maxx Crosby blows up another play, this time dropping Jameson Williams for a loss of six.

9:06 p.m. — Big play alert! Goff hits an open Amon-Ra St. Brown, who goes 44 yards to breathe life into the Lions' offense.

9:03 p.m. — The Raiders' offense continues to have nothing in the tank. Las Vegas gains four yards and is forced to punt after less than a minute with the ball.

Lions 6, Raiders 0

8:58 p.m. FIELD GOAL — Detroit was simply trying to draw the Raiders offsides. It didn't work. Riley Patterson's field goal is good, and the Lions extend their lead to six.

8:56 p.m. — Raymond makes up some yardage on fourth down but comes up about eight yards short of the goal line. The Lions may be considering going for it...

8:55 p.m. — The Lions are moving backwards after a holding call on Taylor Decker.

End of first quarter: Lions 3, Raiders 0

8:51 p.m. — Goff comes under heavy pressure on 3rd & 11 but finds a wide open Kalif Raymond for the first down. The Lions are into the red zone.

8:49 p.m. — There's Amon-Ra St. Brown. Goff hits him on back-to-back plays for a total of 20 yards.

8:47 p.m. — Garoppolo's fourth down pass goes to no man's land after Hunter Renfrow falls down. The Lions will be set up not too far from field goal range.

8:46 p.m. — The Raiders will go for it on 4th & 2 from about midfield...

8:43 p.m. — The Raiders' defense rises to the challenge and forces a quick three-and-out. Detroit is punting for the first time tonight.

8:38 p.m. INTERCEPTION — And just like that... Jimmy Garoppolo turns it over. That can't happen. Kerby Joseph picks it off just in front of the end zone and gets the ball back to the Lions' offense two plays after the fumble.

8:36 p.m. FUMBLE — A big mistake from Josh Reynolds, who loses the ball after a catch and sees it quickly scooped up by the Raiders. It's Las Vegas ball deep in Lions territory.

8:33 p.m. — Garoppolo fights hard for the first down, using his legs and taking a big hit, but he comes up a yard short. The Raiders will punt.

8:31 p.m. — A flag flies on the Raiders' first offensive snap, but it's picked back up as Josh Jacobs takes a pass 12 yards for a quick first down.

Lions 3, Raiders 0

8:26 p.m. FIELD GOAL — The Lions' running game stalls out, but not before they worked their way into field goal range. Riley Patterson drills one from 44 yards out to put Detroit in front early.

8:22 p.m. — With Gibbs getting a breather, Craig Reynolds comes in and delivers a bruising 11-yard run. The Lions are bullying their way down the field.

8:21 p.m. — Is this the Jahmyr Gibbs game? He already has six touches and just ran his way to another first down.

8:19 p.m. — Gibbs picks up another Lions first down on a catch-and-run. He's heavily involved in the offense early on with David Montgomery out.

8:18 p.m. — Goff hands off to Jahmyr Gibbs on the first two snaps of the night, and he hits Sam LaPorta on third down to convert. Nice start for the Lions' rookie class tonight.

8:15 p.m. — The Lions will start with the ball, and we are underway!

8:07 p.m. — As the broadcast points out, this is a homecoming for Michigan native Maxx Crosby. The play of him and fellow Michigan native Aidan Hutchinson will be pivotal tonight.

7:56 p.m. — Josh Jacobs hasn't averaged more than 3.6 yards per carry in a single game this season. Can he get going against a strong Lions run defense? It'll be tough to win without at least some production from the former first-rounder.

7:40 p.m. — On that note... Harlow will be performing at halftime of the Lions' Thanksgiving game next month.

The Roadrunners are in their 13th season as a program but have yet to win a bowl game. This is the fourth bowl game they've played in five years. Marshall is competing in a bowl game for the seventh straight year.

UTSA Roadrunners betting news

UTSA has hit its stride over the second half of the season, before losing 29-16 to Tulane in its last outing. The Roadrunners scored at least 34 points in every win since Oct. 7, proving to be an offensive juggernaut. Everything starts with star QB Frank Harris.

The dual-threat QB has completed 64.9% of his passes this season for 2,506 yards and 18 touchdowns. While impressive, he totaled 4,059 yards and 32 TDs on a 69.6% completion rate last year. UTSA's offense is good, but we've seen a better version of the unit in recent seasons.

Still, Harris' experience and talent often shine through. UTSA's leading receiver Joshua Cephus did the heavy lifting for the unit. He caught 82 passes for 1,049 yards and nine touchdowns. The offense also had four ball carriers with at least 323 rushing yards, so there are plenty of threats for head coach Jeff Traylor to unleash.

UTSA averaged 31.7 points and 424.6 total yards per game, which rank 37th and 39th in the nation, respectively. Roadrunners opponents ranked 69th in third down conversion rate, but the defense allowed an 87.5% score rate in the red zone (99th).

UTSA is 5-6-1 ATS and 4-7-1 to the OVER.

The Roadrunners will be without their best defensive player, Trey Moore, as he looks to jump to a Power 5 school. Moore led the conference in sacks, so he's a star-level absence for the unit.

Marshall Thundering Herd betting news

The toughest blow for Marshall in this game is being without second-year starting QB Cam Fancher (transfer portal). Instead, Marshall will start freshman Cole Pennington, who is the son of former Marshall star QB Chad Pennington. Pennington has thrown six interceptions and zero touchdowns on only 79 passing attempts this season.

Marshall's offense will continue to run through star RB Rasheen Ali. The senior speedster carried the offense even when Fancher was under center, totaling 1,256 yards and 15 touchdowns on the season. This offense has struggled despite Ali's efforts, ranking 93rd in scoring and 89th in yards per game.

On the season, Marshall is 4-8 ATS and 6-6 on the O/U board. The Herd won only three of their eight conference games on the season.

UTSA vs. Marshall prediction: Frank Harris leads Roadrunners past the Herd

Even with the transfer portal hitting this game hard, the UTSA offense will be too much for Marshall to keep up with. The Roadrunners push the pace in a way that Marshall can't replicate, and the Thundering Herd aren't efficient enough to make the most of what few scoring opportunities they'll have.

The Thundering Herd could find themselves down several scores by the end of the first frame if Pennington turns the ball over, as he's prone to do. UTSA is a well-oiled machine against teams with similar or worse talent, and Marshall is in that latter category.

It's a big number to lay, but we're on the favorite Tuesday night.

When looking at North Texas vs. SMU odds, props and predictions, the recent past gives us a pretty good window into what to expect: Over the previous four seasons, SMU has clamped down on North Texas by scores of 48-10, 35-12, 65-35 and 49-27, covering the spread each time and comfortably in all but one.

Here are the latest college football betting odds for the Mean Green vs. Mustangs:

This opened Mustangs -14 and an exorbitant total of 71.5 in Vegas, which had shifted to 16 and 67.5, respectively, 24 hours later. Two of our three models have SMU winning by 22 and 18 points, so the spread grabs our attention.

North Texas betting news: There’s no 'D' in Mean Green

This will be a challenge for North Texas because SMU possesses a top-10 defense, allowing foes only 0.251 points per play; which only stiffens (to 0.185) when the Ponies play at home.

The North Texas defense is 12th from the D-I basement, giving up 0.501 ppp; and an even looser 0.533 on the highway.

SMU’s 20th-rated offense (0.483) sharpens to a ridiculous 0.662 at home—the only squads more efficient in their own yards are USC (0.780), LSU (0.762), Oregon (0.712) and Washington (0.690).

The definition of élite.

Until he had two passes picked off last Saturday in a 38-20 defeat to UTSA, junior QB Chandler Jones had thrown 262 passes through seven games with 19 TDs and no interceptions.

Jones, who started his career at Louisiana-Monroe, snatched the job from Stone Earle early in the season and hasn’t disappointed first-year coach Eric Morris.

The Mean Green defense has been another story, since allowing 681 total yards to Cal in the opener. Its past three foes have rung up 1,460 total yards and 15 TDs. Its yield of 479 yards per game is the worst in the country.

That sound you hear is SMU super sophomore QB Preston Stone licking his chops as he read that last sentence.

SMU betting news: Ponies on a stone-cold winning streak

The Mustangs are knotted atop the AAC with fellow 5-0 squads Tulane and UTSA. They’ve accumulated 1,685 total yards of offense in their past three games, including 91 first downs via passing, running or penalty, and 18 touchdowns.

By happy coincidence, no doubt for second-year SMU boss Rhett Lashlee, the defense has flexed over that span, yielding just 668 total yards, 39 total first downs and a mere four TDs.

When last seen at Gerald J. Ford Stadium, two weeks ago, rain might have kept fans away as only 20,800 filled the 32,000-capacity barn for SMU’s 69-10 homecoming belting of Tulsa.

Stone, playing near where he was raised, threw touchdown strikes of 74, 62 and 17 yards. By halftime, it was 52-3, the most Division I points tallied in the first 30 minutes this year.

The 6-foot-2 sophomore from Dallas has been heating up lately, perfect timing to continue improving SMU’s bowl prospects after a 2-2 start that included keen tests (and defeats) at Oklahoma and TCU.

The Mustangs own a five-game winning streak, and in his past four games Stone has thrown 122 passes, 10 for touchdowns and none for interceptions. He’s also run it in twice.

He threw for 300 yards against Prairie View A&M, and in this golden four-game stretch he’s accumulated 1,171 aerial yards.

Receivers RJ Maryland and Jordan Hudson have five TD catches apiece, and Roderick Daniels Jr. has four. Three others have two. Jaylan Knighton (511 yards, four TDs) paces the ground game.

However, Stone’s sterling development might have found a speed bump last week at Rice when he left early in the fourth quarter after getting hit hard. He zipped to the locker room and returned, minus his helmet.

If concussion protocol restricts him from playing Friday, look for redshirt freshman Kevin Jennings to start for SMU. He’s thrown 42 career passes, with 33 completions, four TDs and no picks.

Should Stone not play, we will call an audible and play Under this total. Monitor it closely and prepare to take action within an hour of kickoff.

North Texas vs. SMU props

Player props for North Texas vs. SMU have not been made available at top sportsbooks, but BetRivers is offering several game props.

sports,Arunima Bhanot,2023-10-22T21:30:14+00:00,"A decade ago, the Houston Astros were struggling to stay afloat. Parting ways with the National League after 50 years of play, the team was looking forward to an American League move. Hoping that their fortunes would be reversed from regularly ranking near the bottom of divisional standings, the Stros applied every method they could think of to win. But they weren’t all above board.

Jim Crane had obtained club ownership on Nov. 17, 2011. That same year, he brought in Jeff Luhnow, former McKinsey & Company management consultant, as General Manager. In 2014, Crane brought in A.J. Hinch as the manager after the firing of Bo Porter. And there began the story of the rise and decline of one of baseball’s biggest controversies.

The Story Behind the Cheating Scandal That Rocked the 2017 MLB Season

ADVERTISEMENT Article continues below this ad

Jeff Luhnow had always been more about the numbers than people. Wanting to take out the humanity factor from baseball, he was almost an outcast in the sport when Jim Crane hired him. But his radical approach had worked in St. Louis, giving them two championships in six years. Why not the Bayou City next?

The Houston Astros had not seen a World Series title yet and hadn’t even made the playoffs since 2005. Apparently desperate for any measures, they resorted to cheating. Perhaps the biggest surprise was that Luhnow didn’t consider his methods to be dishonest.

As it turned out, the Astros had stolen signs throughout the 2017 season and the beginning of 2018. But the hornet’s nest wasn’t broken open until next year, when The Athletic‘s Ken Rosenthal and Evan Drellich reported on it. After that, all hell broke loose.

What Is Sign Stealing and How Did the Astros Manage to Do It?

Powers of observation are as strong a skill as pitching or hitting and they’re perfectly legal in baseball. A batter can sometimes figure out from a pitcher’s unconscious movements, or ‘tells’, what kind of ball is coming their way. At any given moment, non-verbal signs are flying around between a dugout and the field as a way for the players to communicate with a manager or coach. But as long as it’s done without extra help, this sign stealing is, in fact, allowed. What Houston did was not.

The Stros installed cameras in center field at Minute Maid Park to record the opposing team’s catcher and pitcher’s signs. Cameras in a ballpark are ideally for challenging calls, but what was one more purpose? The funny thing is, teams have tried to catch on to their rival team’s signs since competitive baseball became a thing. The communication between the catcher and the pitcher can be key to hitting. But the 21st century has an added advantage – technology.

Behind the scenes, players could see a live feed from the camera. Then-bench coach Alex Cora decided to get a screen installed in the dugout. Players or managers would watch the live feed on the television placed in the tunnel leading from the dugout to the clubhouse. The irony lay in the method they used to then really the information to whoever was up to bat on the plate.

Having tried out different methods of shouting and calling, the Astros landed on, of all things, a trash can. Players would bang on them, often using bats, with different rhythms signifying different pitches. Of course, they couldn’t do it at each home game, nor did they try. But whatever sorcery Houston had been practicing that year, it did the trick. It worked like a charm, and the Astros had their first World Series trophy in a long history.

How Did MLB React to It? What Punishment Did It Hand Down?

Not well. No one likes being taken for a fool and what the Astros had done undermined everything the league stood for. Fair play was the holy grail, yet the team had tread on it heartlessly. Fans were livid, although they didn’t get to let out their frustration until 2021.

MLB, for its part, tried to curb the situation as best as it could. In two months, the league investigated “68 people, including 23 Astros players, and collect more than 76,000 emails,” according to The Athletic. Luhnow’s phone showed signs of deleted information. Jan. 13, 2020, was when MLB suspended the disgraced GM and the skipper for the 2020 season. Only for Jim Crane to fire both a few hours later. But for many, the solution was severely lacking.

Why Were the Astros Allowed to Keep Their World Series Trophy?

In the words of MLB Commissioner Robert Manfred, “Once you go down that road of changing what happens on the field, I just don’t know how you decide where you stop.” While many thought taking away the World Series win, essentially nullifying 2017, was the best way to move forward, MLB thought otherwise. The Coomissioner’s Trophy was still legitimate in the eyes of, well, the Commissioner.

“Cheaters” Houston Astros Suddenly Gain Momentum as College Baseball Team Stirs Up Controversial Trash Can Past Along With Thousands

By the time the controversy was uncovered, the Astros were well into establishing a streak of successful years. Manfred called the process of stripping the Fall Classic title “difficult and impractical.” Already unpopular among the masses, he made things worse for himself when he called the trophy a “piece of metal.” Although he apologized later, the team kept the championship victory.

Why Were the Players Not Penalized?

It was an arduous process, investigating an entire organization. While the players were undoubtedly the ones who had put the tactics into play, the Astros staff suffered the heaviest consequences. The ballplayers were instead granted full immunity in exchange for cooperating with the investigation. Indeed, who would refuse such an offer?

Of course, not everyone had been comfortable with what the Astros were doing behind the scenes, like Mike Fiers. Of that original team, four are still in Houston – Jose Altuve, Alex Bregman, Lance McCullers Jr., and Justin Verlander. What makes fans ponder their extreme methods is how genuinely skilled each is. Yet they participated, willingly or unwillingly, in the biggest baseball scandal in recent years.

Is the Inquiry Still On?

After the Jan. 13, 2020 declaration, not much came from Manfred. Other than suspending the front office, MLB fined the Astros $5 million, the maximum amount, and made them forfeit first and second-round draft picks. For better or for worse, the inquiry is over.

How Did the MLB World See This Entire Case?

Needless to say, cheating is never taken in a positive light. Players once accused of using PEDs face the consequences long after they have been retired. It’s only been six years since 2017, and the league is still angry. Back then, social media was a landmine that the Astros probably stayed away from. It was the trash cans that did them in – the irony was too brilliant, or hilarious if one looks at it another way, to ignore.

Boos and jabs at away games were the least of it. When the Astros went to play against the Los Angeles Dodgers, the team they had defeated in the 2017 World Series, fans retaliated by throwing inflatable trash cans onto the field. Others brought tin trash can caps to bang on when the Astros played against their teams. The phrase “Take the trash out” took a life of its own.

But it wasn’t just baseball fans who were furious, other sports also considered it a tragedy. Fair play is taken seriously; no one likes being cheated out of an award. Even NBA star LeBron James spoke out in criticism against Houston.

Has MLB Taken Any Action to Stop It From Happening Again?

Before the details of the scandal came out, MLB had handed out warnings here and there against sign stealing. After this fiasco, new restrictions in 2020 prevented the video replay from including the catcher’s signs. In 2022, PitchCom devices also debuted. They allow a pitcher to communicate with the catcher without signs and a few other players on the field can also wear it. But will these tactics help?

In one American League Wild Card Series, the whole thing turned on a play designed around crowd noise. It was too loud at Target Field, Twins shortstop Carlos Correa realized, for the third-base coach to warn Blue Jays baserunners about a developing pickoff play. The Twins used the noise to their advantage, picked off Vladimir Guerrero Jr. and secured a two-game sweep.

In the other AL Wild Card Series, empty seats were everywhere. The Rays are an excellent team that thrives on their underdog status — low payroll, injured players, they always find a way — but playing in front of two of the smallest postseason crowds in the past 100 years, the Rays were swept by a Rangers team that had nine fewer wins in the regular season. The indifference was deafening.

Home-field advantage, it turns out, just isn’t the same from one ballpark to the next.

“To be honest with you, I think we have one of the best home-field advantages in baseball,” third baseman Alec Bohm said as the Phillies swept the Marlins to improve to 24-11 in postseason games at Citizens Bank Park. “People say it’s difficult to play here and things like that. I think going through that type of stuff and learning how to play here, that just makes this time of year that much better.”

This time of year certainly brings out the best, and the postseason’s greatest moments tend to be punctuated by the crowds who witness and react in real time. After seeing the way crowds could respond — or not — to October baseball this week, The Athletic ranked the home-field environments of the eight remaining playoff teams, from the replaceable to the Phanatical.

No. 8: Arizona Diamondbacks Team Venue Opened Capacity Att. (2023) Diamondbacks Chase Field 1998 48,405 24,212

Memorable postseason moment: Game 7 of the 2001 World Series started with a pair of 20-game winners in Roger Clemens and Curt Schilling and ended with Hall of Famers on the mound: Mariano Rivera and Randy Johnson. In what is remembered as one of the greatest postseason games of all time, Luis Gonzalez blooped a bases-loaded single to score Jay Bell and deny the Yankees their fourth consecutive title.

Our take: We’re sorry, D-Backs fans. It’s not you. It’s them. A tremendously impressive two-game sweep in Milwaukee carried the Diamondbacks into a division series showdown with, oh boy, the Dodgers. It’s not that we don’t think Arizona can beat L.A. at home — the Diamondbacks split six games against the Dodgers at Chase Field this season — but it’s less than a seven-hour drive from Dodger Stadium to downtown Phoenix, and we’re concerned that all the quirks of that ballpark could be rendered meaningless if there’s a bunch of Dodgers blue in the crowd.

There’s a lot to like. The pool. The retractable roof. We love it. We hope you prove us wrong. Show up, go nuts, and leave a comment — click to subscribe! — telling us we don’t know a rattlesnake from a water moccasin. We deserve it.

But if we had to go on the road for a playoff game, at least in this round, we’d choose your ballpark. Consider it a compliment! Or maybe we just like the dry heat.

No. 7: Texas Rangers Team Venue Opened Capacity Att. (2023) Rangers Globe Life Field 2020 40,300 31,272

Memorable postseason moment: There have been 16 postseason games in Globe Life Field history, but the Rangers have never appeared in a playoff game at their new-ish home. How did that happen? Well, 2020. It was a weird time. The Dodgers played in all 16 of those during the 2020 expanded playoffs, sweeping the Padres in the NLDS, going seven games with the Braves in the NLCS and then winning the World Series.

Our take: This is the great unknown. Globe Life Field opened in a season that had no fans, and it remained open for losing seasons in 2021 and 2022. Saturday will be our first look at the place when the home team is actually playing meaningful baseball in October. Hard to rank it any higher until we know what we’re dealing with.

Largest crowd ever for a game at Globe Life Field. #StraightUpTX pic.twitter.com/4I7NIB5eF8 — Chris Halicke (@ChrisHalicke) May 1, 2022

The old Rangers ballpark could drum up a Texas-sized atmosphere worthy of Stevie Ray Vaughan and Pat Green, but the new place — at least in the regular season — feels very much like a multi-events space that happens to be hosting a ballgame. Maybe that changes in the playoffs? The Rangers haven’t been home since Sept. 24 when they won their last five games in Arlington, the last three of which went a long way toward keeping the Mariners out of the postseason.

With a closed roof containing all the noise, Globe Life is sure to get awfully loud, and nothing turns a glorified convention center into a real ballpark quite like a late-inning rally in October.

No. 6: Minnesota Twins Team Venue Opened Capacity Att. (2023) Twins Target Field 2010 38,544 24,371

Memorable postseason moment: For this, you have to go all the way back to Tuesday. The Twins snapped an 18-game postseason losing streak with two blasts off the bat of rookie Royce Lewis. It was their first playoff win since Oct. 5, 2004. On Wednesday, they completed the Wild Card sweep of the Blue Jays for their first postseason series win since 2002. The roars heard at Target Field, like this one, were more than two decades in the making.

One of those 10,000 Rakes definitely belongs to Royce Lewis. 💪 pic.twitter.com/3gRJp2i8eb — MLB (@MLB) October 3, 2023

Our take: We have only a small sample of postseason games at Target Field, but, boy, Twins fans can make some noise. After Game 1 against Toronto, Twins manager Rocco Baldelli said, “I thought the place was going to split open and melt, honestly. It was out of this universe out there on the field. The fans took over the game. They helped us win today.” The next day, they did it again.

Early in Game 2, Correa told Sonny Gray that, because of the crowd noise, Jays baserunners couldn’t hear their third-base coach screaming, “BACK!” So, with Guerrero on second and a full count to Bo Bichette, they executed a perfect timing pick. “The crowd was incredible,” Gray said after the game. “They were incredible yesterday. They were incredible today from the moment I stepped on the mound an hour before the game to the moment — they’re probably still out there.”

So, Twins fans have swarmed their team with support. But is it intimidating? (It’s certainly better than its predecessor, the Metrodome, but it doesn’t have the same potential for overwhelming volume.) For now, Target Field strikes us as more of an awesome place to play than one that strikes fear in the opponent. But this month Twins fans could prove us very wrong.

No. 5: Houston Astros Team Venue Opened Capacity Att. (2023) Astros Minute Maid Park 2000 41,168 37,683

Memorable postseason moment: Albert Pujols off Brad Lidge? Jorge Soler to the moon? Nah, we’ll go with Chris Burke ending what was then the longest game in MLB postseason history in both time (5 hours, 50 minutes) and innings (18) with a walk-off home run with one out in the 18th inning in the 2005 NLDS. Burke didn’t start the game but pinch-ran for Lance Berkman in the 10th. Roger Clemens came into the game for Houston in the 16th and pitched three scoreless to pick up the win. But it is Burke’s homer that will always be remembered.

Our take: We get it, Houston. We also think your ballpark should be in the top half of this list. One of our writers called it “the loudest stadium I’ve ever attended, by at least one standard deviation.” The Astros sold out the building 23 times this year. They drew 3 million fans for the first time since 2007. Minute Maid Park is big and loud, and visiting fans show up fully exhausted from walking in the south Texas sun.

The final out from the crowd’s point of view. Wow. Congrats Astros!!! World Series champs again!! #fortheH pic.twitter.com/HKnal8fcuB — Sally MacDonald (@SallyMacFox26) November 6, 2022

But in all those sellouts, the Astros went 6-17. Despite all that noise, they were 39-42 at home. Before their final homestand, the team added some green paint to the batter’s eye in response to player complaints, and the Astros responded by going 1-5 with three of those losses coming against the Royals. So, yes, the ballpark is packed tighter than toes in a cowboy boot, and the place gets louder than a Pantera concert in a concrete basement, but these Astros just haven’t responded to it. Why not? Should a visiting team really be all that intimidated by it? Bring back the in-play flagpole atop Tal’s Hill, we say!

No. 4: Atlanta Braves Team Venue Opened Capacity Att. (2023) Braves Truist Park 2017 41,084 39,401

Memorable postseason moment: When the Braves won the World Series in 1914, they were still playing in Boston. In 1957, Milwaukee. When Sid Bream slid home to beat the Pirates in 1992, the Braves were in the right city but at the wrong ballpark (Fulton County Stadium doesn’t count). The Max Fried-Jorge Soler game in 2021 happened in Houston. The iconic moment at Truist Park could be Eddie Rosario’s dazzling catch at the wall in Game 4 of the 2021 World Series, but the most memorable — even though it didn’t lead to a championship — might be rookie Ronald Acuna Jr. hitting a grand slam off Walker Buhler in Game 3 of the 2018 NLDS, which happened to be the first postseason game ever played at the ballpark.

Our take: Obviously, there are issues bigger than baseball to deal with here. The war chant and Tomahawk Chop are offensive and problematic, but we’re not going to resolve that issue in the next four weeks. In fact, it’s all about to come front and center — again — as the best team in baseball opens its postseason with a roster that would be plenty intimidating in a Little League park with metal bleachers.

Advertisement

But have you ever seen them play in front of 40,000 screaming fans when the stadium lights go dark and the entire ballpark starts doing the Chop in unison with their lit cell phones?

“It does add something to the offensive ambiance,” our Braves scribe David O’Brien noted.

Truist Park had 54 sellouts this season, and the place drew just over 3.19 million, which was the Braves’ highest total attendance since the park formerly known as SunTrust opened in 2017.

The Braves have won six straight division titles, and they’ve been to the playoffs 22 times since 1991. This is not uncharted territory for them. This ballpark is going to be packed with fans who know their team is good and will not be quiet about it, regardless of what anyone else thinks.

No. 3: Baltimore Orioles Team Venue Opened Capacity Att. (2023) Orioles Oriole Park at Camden Yards 1992 44,970 23,911

Memorable postseason moment: Delmon Young’s three-run double in the eighth inning of Game 2 of the 2014 ALDS completed the Orioles’ comeback from three runs down in the eighth to beat the Tigers. Zack Britton pitched a perfect ninth, and the Orioles would go on to beat the Tigers in Game 3 in Detroit to sweep the series before losing to the Royals in the ALCS.

Our take: When the Orioles are bad, their ballpark is bad. Beautiful and unmistakable, but bad because of the empty seats and because it is basically a second home ballpark for every East Coast team that takes the train into Baltimore and overwhelms the place with their own variation of the “Let’s go, Yankees” chant. It’s a ballpark that can be, and has been, taken over by opposing fans.

When the Orioles are good, though, Camden Yards is one of the best ballparks in the country, and it starts pregame with every rendition of the national anthem that includes the entire ballpark screaming “O!” in unison, so loud that it drowns out the word “say” before the hope-they’re-ready-for-it singer gets to the words, “does that star-spangled banner yet wave.”

The final night game of the 2023 regular season at Camden Yards pic.twitter.com/ALgqhoJVp6 — Andy Kostka (@afkostka) September 30, 2023

As you’ve no doubt realized, the Orioles are awfully good this year, and we expect Camden Yards to follow their lead. The O’s had the second-most wins in baseball, and their fans responded with a home attendance that jumped more than a half million from last season. A young Orioles roster might be at risk of being shell-shocked on the road, but at home, this team is going to be treated as heroes from the start.

Let’s just hope, when they go on the road, manager Brandon Hyde doesn’t forget to use his best reliever in a must-win game. That could be pretty bad.

No. 2: Los Angeles Dodgers Team Venue Opened Capacity Att. (2023) Dodgers Dodger Stadium 1962 56,000 47,371

Memorable postseason moment: With two outs and a runner on in the ninth inning of Game 1 of the 1988 World Series, Kirk Gibson hobbled toward home plate and stepped in against Hall of Fame A’s closer Dennis Eckersley. The Dodgers were down one and down to their last out. Gibson had an injured left hamstring and a balky right knee. He fouled off Eckersley’s first offering and almost fell over. He fouled off a couple more and worked the count full. Then he pulled an outside pitch into the right-field seats for a walk-off homer and, somehow, made his way around the bases. It remains one of the most badass moments in World Series history.

Our take: All the jokes about traffic still making its way into the parking lot in the second inning are justified. The “intensity” of baseball in L.A. isn’t the same as it is in, say, St. Louis or Boston or any other city where athletes are the biggest celebrities in town.

Advertisement

But by the middle innings, Dodger Stadium is packed, and by the late innings of playoff games, the place has the over-the-top intensity of a Michael Bay car chase (Mookie Betts as Bumblebee). More than one opposing pitcher this season had to tweak his PitchCom device to deal with the late-inning noise that came from such a massive ballpark, one that once again held the largest total attendance in baseball this year.

“You’ve got a four-deck stadium,” Freddie Freeman said this summer. “It’s the only one in baseball. You’ve got 50,000 people, every single night here. For them to go out of their way to make you feel good when you’re doing your job, it means a lot. I do appreciate it. It does make you feel good inside and also just means you’re doing your job pretty good.”

Speaking of doing a job pretty good, the Dodger Stadium D.J. is a maniac. For starters, the volume is set at a level that can’t possibly meet OSHA standards, and beyond that, there’s some twisted desire to have some sort of noise blaring at all times. Plus, there’s the intimidation factor of playing in an iconic ballpark that feels like no other in baseball. Dodger Stadium knows what it is and what it’s about, and it uses every bit of that to its advantage.

No. 1: Philadelphia Phillies Team Venue Opened Capacity Att. (2023) Phillies Citizens Bank Park 2004 42,792 38,157

Memorable postseason moment: There have been three no-hitters in postseason history, and two have taken place at Citizens Bank Park. Those in Philly would like to forget the Astros’ combined no-hitter in Game 4 of last season’s World Series, so instead we’ll concentrate on Roy Halladay’s 2010 no-hitter in Game 1 of the NLDS against the Reds. In his first postseason start, Halladay allowed only one baserunner, when Jay Bruce walked with two outs in the fifth inning.

Our take: Look, Philadelphia fans have thrown snowballs at Santa Claus and batteries at J.D. Drew. Their Phanatic mascot is iconic, but part of his charm is the way he – it? – taunts and antagonizes opponents. It’s a real love-it or hate-it place to play. The Phillies and their fans are capable of producing unforgettable moments, like Wednesday night when Bryson Stott hit a grand slam and the ballpark provided the only commentary necessary.

stott grand slam w/ no commentators thx to ESPN's dolby 5.1 mix pic.twitter.com/2vhUzWKpup — jaiden (@steph_turkey) October 5, 2023

“I yelled at the dugout and couldn’t really hear myself,” Stott said, “so I knew the crowd was loud. Any time we get to play here, you know it’s going to be loud from the very first pitch. I wouldn’t want to play anywhere else. It’s a phenomenal time every time we take the field here in the postseason.”

“I’ve always said it, we’ve got the best fans in baseball,” Bryce Harper added. “It’s an amazing place to play.”

Goals from Alejandro Garnacho and Bruno Fernandes fired them into a two-goal lead within 18 minutes before Chelsea loanee Hakim Ziyech struck back.

Scott McTominay scored what he thought would have been a crucial third shortly after the break but United failed to hold on.

Another free-kick from Ziyech caught Andre Onana off guard once again and a strong strike from Kerem Akturkoglu levelled the scoring.

United now have to beat Bayern Munich and hope Galatasaray draw with FC Copenhagen on the final matchday to progress, and it's the third time in the Champions League this season that they have been in a winning position and then failed to emerge victorious.

Eight points have been dropped when they've been in the lead, and no other team has suffered a worse fate this term.

Captain Fernandes appears to be fed up of their inability to hold onto results as he told TNT Sports: ""Every time we concede a goal we had many chances to score again.

""I think at the end of the game we had like four chances to score a goal but we have to get our heads up and understand that sometimes it's about finding another pass, finding the player that is free.

""Trying to get the best one in the best position and take the chance ourselves, we have to look for the team first and after, for ourselves.""

He added: ""It's too bad to be honest, I don't want to be too negative but for what we've been doing in the Champions League is not enough, we have to control our games every time.

""It's not the first game we've had like this, even with FC Copenhagen, I understand we had one player less but we scored to make it 3-2 and we had to secure the result.

""We have to understand in these kind of games, in these kind of stages, you have to be smart enough and manage the game better.""

United have also conceded 14 goals in the Champions League group stages, a new and unwanted record for the club that could get worse when they face Bayern in the final match.

Onana has been criticised for his role in Galatasaray's second goal as he allowed Ziyech's shot to spill under him and into the net, although Erik ten Hag says collectively the defence isn't up to scratch.

""We're winning and then we're losing, we should have taken three points,"" the United boss told TNT Sports. ""But there's also in more games, at home against Galatasaray, away in Copenhagen, we play so good so I have to make a big compliment to the team.

""But also in the same moment I have to criticise the team and us as coaching staff, me as a manager. We aren't defending good enough, we are leading 3-1 and we can't afford such mistakes because that makes the difference.""

""Every goal has it's own story,"" he added. ""The first is a transition moment, we spoke about quick release and we don't block the middle.

""The second is an unnecessary free-kick but then we have to defend the free-kick better. The third one we are very good and organised but we got run off and we are in an overload there.

""So, our mistakes can never happen in the Champions League, you get punished for it, so we have to learn from that.""

However, Aston Villa legend Gabby Agbonlahor insists Onana needs to take a significant chunk of the blame for United's collapse on Wednesday night.

""I feel sorry for Onana,"" Agbonlahor told talkSPORT. ""There's a clip of him throwing his gloves to the ground after the game. He's angry with himself.

""But those two free-kicks... you can't score those. They're easy saves and he's cost his team.

""If Onana doesn't make those two mistakes, I think United go on to win 4-1.

""He's so laid back on the ball that he can't switch on, he's late to dive for the free-kicks.""

United's 12 goals in the group stage is the fifth highest tally out of any club but their defensive woes have been their downfall, and former defender Rio Ferdinand cites a lack of balance as to why.

The 2007/08 Champions League winner with Man United said: ""I think they've got to look at themselves.

""You can't go into a Champions League campaign and score nine goals in three away games and have one point at the end of it. I think that shows you that there's a lack of balance in the team at the moment.

""Yes they can get goals and yes they are attacking at will and creating chances, many of them coming through Bruno. But I think defensively, they just made mistakes, I think the goalkeeper today has to hold his hands up and say, 'Yep, I was at fault for a couple of goals.

""He should do better. But, I think the manager will be scratching his head and thinking, 'The game plan first-half worked perfectly,' and then all of a sudden they score a goal, it changes the dynamic of the game.

""They were 2-0 up, 2-1, and you're thinking, 'Wow, I set the team up perfectly well, they execute it but then a mistake cost us,' and at 3-1, the same again.

""So I think there's a lot of question marks in the performances and the way they're going about things at the moment but balance for me is one of the key aspects that they've got to really find.

""We mentioned in commentary, scars from throwing away leads, those are hard to get away, you've got to really manage games and he mentioned that himself Bruno, you've got to go out managing games correctly.

""They've got to do that not over one or two or three games, they've got to do that over a period of games now so they can erase those scars that they've created and they'e grown through bad results and throwing away leads, especially in Europe.""",Leaky defence ‘isn’t good enough’ and ‘scars’ grow from throwing away leads – It’s all going wrong for Manchester United in Europe,https://talksport.com/football/1659923/man-utd-defending-scars-champions-league/,TalkSport
sports,Will Unwin,2023-11-27T22:30:42+00:00,"It is 30 years since Manchester United’s most famous trip to Istanbul with Champions League elimination on the line. Galatasaray created an unwelcome hell that Cerberus would have been proud of and a night of sin ended with Alex Ferguson’s side being dumped out of Europe.

United, realistically, required a win to progress after drawing 3‑3 in the first leg of the second‑round tie at Old Trafford but the atmosphere in Turkey subdued the visitors and the second leg stuttered to a goalless draw. Eric Cantona was sent off late on for his frustrations with the referee and the home team’s addiction to timewasting. There was a post-match melee in the tunnel involving the United squad and riot police as the trip ended like it began – with intimidation. Many of United’s team froze, unable to deal with the ferocious and vociferous atmosphere they faced.

The match on Wednesday is not a knockout game but in truth the scenario is not much different. Defeat against Galatasaray would again end United’s Champions League’s campaign prematurely while a win, assuming Copenhagen lose against Bayern Munich, would put qualifying for the latter stages back in their hands. United will face the same atmosphere as they did 30 years ago because the home fans know victory would turn their subsequent trip to Denmark into a potential shootout for who goes through with Bayern, with the achievement of knocking out a club with the storied history of United only adding to the pleasure.

In 1993 everyone was on a learning curve at United. It was their first return to Europe’s top table after an absence of 24 years. Much of the squad had won the European Cup Winners’ Cup in 1990‑91 but this was a clear step up. They defeated Honved before needing a late intervention from Cantona to avoid a deficit heading to Istanbul, where they were greeted at the airport by a horde of Galatasaray supporters providing a wall of noise and the infamous “Welcome to Hell” banner.

“That was our first foray in the Champions League and we were expected to go through,” says the former United defender Gary Pallister, who was injured for the game and so had to watch proceedings from the stands. “The hostility is something [to learn from] – I never experienced anything like that in the rest of my career. You look at that and think it can’t get any worse.”

Thirty years on United head to Turkey knowing they have rarely been convincing in the Champions League in recent years. A 3-1 away win against Paris Saint-Germain in the 2018-19 round of 16 after losing the home leg 2-0 was the last time they won a crunch match. In 2020‑21, they lost their final two group games and were eliminated, while back in 2015-16, Wolfsburg won the deciding group match to knock out United.

When it comes to pressure in the Champions League of late, United do not cope well and there are few events trickier than a night in Istanbul. Pallister smiled at a bell boy at the team hotel and got a finger across the throat in response, Brian McClair had a cleaner bang on his bedroom ceiling in the night and other players received numerous phone calls to disrupt their sleep. The current squad could face the same level of malevolence and need to be prepared.

United have done little learning in recent times, repeating the same failures in Europe’s elite competition. It would not be a disgrace to lose against a good Galatasaray team, especially given Erik ten Hag is missing key players, but if the worst does happen, everyone will need to come out of the experience stronger. Regardless of the result, it should be a night of education when it comes to the demands of the Champions League.

Six of United’s squad that failed in 1993 went on to win the competition six years later. “It did galvanise us,” says Mike Phelan, who started in central midfield 30 years ago. “Winning the Cup Winners’ Cup took us to another level and we felt pretty comfortable with each other and felt we could develop into a serious team, and I think going into the Champions League was one of those moments where we expected to do well – the experiences along the way were great and took us to the next level further down the line.

“I think that it is important sometimes that you have to go through those moments to realise what it takes. There are elements that happen in a football match and elements that happen in the buildup to a football match, so you have to experience all those things if you want to be successful.”

The win against Everton on Sunday was defined by two teenagers, Alejandro Garnacho and Kobbie Mainoo. Garnacho scored with an incredible overhead kick and Mainoo impressed on what was his full Premier League debut, which could earn him a start in Turkey and an education in European football.

Around them are players who have succeeded on hostile nights. But if they thought Goodison Park was unwelcoming, they will be in for a surprise on Wednesday and will need to find communal coping mechanisms.

sports,Christy Doran,2023-10-28T21:06:03+00:00,"STADE DE FRANCE – Twenty-eight years between drinks and drama was always on the cards between these two great foes. Little did we know just how much.

But just like that famous win at Ellis Park where Nelson Mandela handed over the William Webb Ellis Cup to Francois Pienaar, it was the Springboks who once again prevailed 12-11 in an instant classic.

Unlike the blue skies that greeted Johannesburg and the Boeing 747 plane that sent shivers down the spines of everyone in attendance in 1995, rain and dampness poured down on the Stade de France.

Facebook Twitter Whatsapp Reddit Email Share

Yet, nothing was going to dampen this evening as 80,065 fans poured in.

In a match of controversy, where cards of yellow and red were handed out quicker than a game of Uno, thundering shots both legal and illegal were put on by rugby’s two greatest sides.

Sam Cane – the All Blacks captain – was forced to watch the match from the sidelines for 53 minutes after having his yellow card for a high shot on Jesse Kriel upgraded to red. His opposite in the number seven jersey, Siya Kolisi, was later shown a yellow card for a high shot on Ardie Savea, but returned.

Cheslin Kolbe – the magnificent winger who sealed their World Cup triumph four years earlier against England – meanwhile couldn’t bare to watch from the sidelines after being shown a yellow card for a deliberate knockdown in the 73rd minute.

It was that kind of evening, where the margins were tiny and the outcomes almighty.

“There are no ways I can explain it,” Kolisi said.

“I want to give credit to the All Blacks. They took us to the end, they took us to a dark place. It shows what kind of team they are, to fight with a man down from early in the game. They put us under so much pressure.

“Credit to my boys too for the fight. I am just grateful we could pull it off.”

Speaking of mighty, Pieter-Steph du Toit – the 2019 World Rugby player of the year – played his best match in four years as he spearheaded the Springboks’ physical onslaught. The back-rower made 28 tackles, each as bone-crunching as the next.

By claiming their third one-point knockout victory in a row, the Springboks moved into uncharted territory by leapfrogging the All Blacks by sealing their fourth World Cup. It was the second straight tournament the Springboks won in France, having beaten England at the same venue in 2007.

A missed Richie Mo’unga conversion following Beauden Barrett’s 58th minute try – the only five-pointer of the match – ultimately proved the difference, as Handre Pollard’s four three-pointers led the Springboks to World Cup glory.

The All Blacks had their chances, but their usual safe handling, a feature throughout the World Cup after their first-up loss to France, evaded them against the Springboks’ blitz defence in the wet conditions.

All night the All Blacks’ timing was off and the forced ball from Savea out wide just as the men in black saw space and looked to open up the Springboks in the 80th minute proved to be killer blow.

Wayne Barnes, who was booed relentlessly, called a scrum reset as the seconds ticked by.

Moments later, their hearts sunk as the Springboks managed to win the scrum and then hang onto the ball.

The victory was the perfect sign-off for the Springboks’ management, with director of rugby Rassie Erasmus set to follow head coach Jacques Nienaber out.

The duo will go down as the greatest coaching duo in rugby history, having led the Springboks to back-to-back World Cup triumphs.

“We came a long way with the players. We always planned for this World Cup, since 2018,” Nienaber said.

“Massive credit to our fans. They were special from South Africa, 62 million people, the videos we had to play from them. It was unbelievable.”

Veteran back-rower Duane Vermeulen will also call time on his illustrious career.

All Blacks coach Ian Foster’s tenure in charge has also come to an end, with Scott Robertson to take over following a bumpy four years in charge.

Robertson will have an almighty task on his hand, with multiple generational players including Dane Coles, Sam Whitelock, Brodie Retallick and Aaron Smith to call time on their international careers. Others like Ardie Savea, Mo’unga, Beauden Barrett and Shannon Frizell will also head to Japan.

While Foster didn’t want to take anything away from the Springboks’ win, he said the game had some issues to sort out regarding the officiating.

“I’m proud of our guys, to go down to that red card so early and fight our way back and give ourselves a chance is pretty special,” the departing All Blacks coach said.

“I don’t think it went wrong in any clear [place on the pitch], it was a real arm wrestle, both teams have their moment, incredibly proud of the way we fought and to get within a whisker of pulling it off is heart-breaking.

“This group is very proud to be All Blacks, very proud to play for their country and have worked incredibly hard to get here.

“While I am so proud of what we did and how we worked we have to give it to South Africa, they are a quality team. They have had a few close victories in this tournament and are a different class. It’s special for them but it equally hurts for us. I can’t ask for much more than we did, we couldn’t put more out on the park.”

Controversy was on display from the outset, as Frizell was shown a yellow card for an illegal cleanout on Springboks hooker Bongi Mbonambi. The incident saw the hooker, who was cleared earlier in the week by World Rugby following an alleged racial slur on England back-rower Tom Curry, replaced by Deon Fourie in the third minute.

The penalty allowed Pollard to step up and bang over three points.

The All Blacks were on the backfoot much of the opening quarter and, after Ethan de Groot was pinged for not rolling away, the Springboks moved further ahead after 12 minutes.

A wicked bounce following a lovely Jordie Barrett chip kick denied Savea a try soon after. But the All Blacks were on the scoreboard via Mo’unga moments later as Barnes was playing advantage.

But the Springboks restored their six-point lead soon after as Savea was pinged for not releasing. Barnes later apologised, with the No.8 having a split-second separation.

The Springboks’ rush defence caused the All Blacks problems all evening, as Damian de Allende and Kriel forced their opponents into errors. Will Jordan, the impressive young outside back who scored eight tries, had a difficult night and was replaced midway through the second half.

The biggest error was around the corner, as Kriel stepped back into the defence and Cane failed to drop his body height and clocked the centre in the jaw. He didn’t return.

The Springboks took a 12-3 lead after 34 minutes when the All Blacks once again failed to release on their goal line. Pollard licked his lips and said ‘thanks’.

The All Blacks managed to cut the deficit to 12-6 after 37 minutes when Eben Etzebeth was caught offside and denied his opponents some quick ball.

Foster’s men breathed a sigh of relief when Kolisi blew a chance out wide when he tucked the ball under his arms and went himself after Beauden Barrett failed to collect a high ball in the 42nd minute.

Minutes later and Kolisi was off, as he cannoned into Savea. He would later return, much to the anger of the New Zealanders in the crowd who were calling for justice.

Sensing an opportunity to strike against 14 men, the All Blacks kicked for the corner on a couple occasions out wide. It came back to haunt them, as their usually silky and composed skill sets failed them.

That much was true when the TMO intervened after Smith thought he had a try in his final Test, but an error at the lineout cancelled out the five-pointer.

Eventually the All Blacks did have a try, as Mark Telea, the All Blacks’ best and biggest attacking threat all night, managed to get on the outside and draw in two defenders before offloading to Beauden Barrett. But Mo’unga missed the conversion to leave them trailing by a point.

That lone point would prove the difference, as the Springboks celebrated a remarkable victory by a remarkable side.","THE GREATEST!

sports,Christy Doran,2023-10-18T20:55:55+00:00,"PARIS – The All Blacks have downplayed Rieko Ioane’s gestures towards Ireland fans and retiring great Johnny Sexton, as the three-time world champions said they have learned to “respect Argentina” ahead of their semi-final on Saturday (6am AEDT).

It comes as Michael Cheika embraced the underdog status and said he was hoping Los Pumas “inspired” Argentina “not by our results but by our ambition”, as the former Wallabies coach readies for another clash against the All Blacks and a second semi-final.

Facebook Twitter Whatsapp Reddit Email Share

Ioane copped a spray from Sexton following their 28-24 nail-biting win over Ireland.

It came after the lethal back cupped his ear at Irish supporters at the Stade de France after the final whistle, as well as putting his finger to his lips in a ‘shush gesture’.

Ian Foster, who made two changes to his starting side and three in total, was forced to defend his centre’s actions while twisting the knife into Sexton’s finish.

“It happens on most sporting parks when tensions are high and a lot at stake,” Foster said.

“Unfortunately recently it’s also included players saying a few things to referees. Is it right for the game? I don’t know. You don’t hear a lot of players complaining about it.”

Captain Sam Cane added: “It’s players’ different personalities and emotions running high in those moments. There’s always people who have different tactics but it’s always just left out there.”

Foster recalled Sam Whitelock to the starting side in the only change to the pack.

Whitelock, whose breakdown penalty win after 37 phases denied Ireland a match-winning penalty, has been recalled and will partner Scott Barrett in the second-row. Brodie Retallick will come off the bench.

Elsewhere, Mark Telea has been recalled ahead of Leicester Fainga’anuku. The tryscoring machine was axed for the quarter-final after missing a team curfew.

“That’s the team we think best for this week,” Foster said.

“Mark has done his time. He made a mistake and accepted what was happening but you don’t linger in that space. He’s been our form winger. We have got a faith in him and think he is in good place to play this game.

“We really enjoyed Leicester Fainga’anuku]’s game last week and he should be proud of that and its’s a tough selection. It’s a chance for us to get Mark on the park.”

The All Blacks are 18-point favourites for the opening semi-final.

It comes despite Argentina knocking over the All Blacks last year in Christchurch, as well as a maiden defeat in 2020 in Sydney.

“The past sets us up beautifully for both teams,” Foster said.

“We do know each other but we don’t know each other terms of a Rugby World Cup, so at this stage in the tournament it’s new territory for us and as we’ve seen World Cups are very different.”

“We have learnt to greatly respect Argentina. They have a rich history of overachieving at the World Cup and have done a fantastic job to get here at the same level we are, so it is going to be a heck of a game.”

Foster said the All Blacks, who suffered a shock semi-final loss to Eddie Jones’ England in 2019, never consider themselves favourites.

“Firstly, you’ve never heard us say we’re favourites,” he said.

‘We know these games are do or die. We’re going to have to improve our performance. The stage gets bigger at this time in the tournament and you’ve got to grow your game. That’s our strong focus. The best team on the night wins – Argentina has done that to us.”

Cheika however was happy to remind the All Blacks who were favourites.

“”New Zealand has always been an example in rugby, a benchmark. They make you think of high-level skills in a really open game but there are always threats in the lineout, mauls and rucks,” said Cheika, whose Wallabies lost in the 2015 final.

“You have to take the moments you are in the game and see them coming at you at different times.

Advertisement

“In the game in 2020 there were things you could pinpoint. You can’t say that one game means we can do it as there are a lot of games where we haven’t.

“That moment has to be just a part of it. What we have done since then, all the success and failures [matters in our preparation]. The other team are heavy favourites, everyone is expecting a New Zealand and South Africa final. We just have to focus on what is required.”

Cheika has maintained that his Los Pumas side was too tight earlier in the tournament but has begun to free themselves up since qualifying for the knockout stages – and rewarding their fans by doing so.

On inspiring the country?

“It’s not easy,” he said.

“We want to inspire not just by our results but by our ambition, by our ability to get back up and overcome obstacles.

Advertisement

“To inspire is not about results, it’s not just one player who played well; no, it’s about our behaviour in general, our ability to be ready to come back from difficult times and seizing our opportunities.

“There are not a lot of opportunities in life – us playing in a semi-final is even rarer and we want to have no regrets.”",‘It happens’: All Blacks defend star centre after spray as Cheika heaps pressure on ‘favourites’ New Zealand,https://www.theroar.com.au/2023/10/19/it-happens-all-blacks-defend-star-centre-after-spray-as-cheika-heaps-pressure-on-favourites-new-zealand/,The Roar | Sports Writers Blog
sports,David Suggs,2023-12-03T23:00:04+00:00,"For 59 minutes, the story of Week 13's 'Sunday Night Football' clash was Jordan Love. The first-year starter continued to showcase his evolution as a big-game player, dicing up Kansas City's All-World defense with incredible efficiency.

Then came the blown calls.

The Packers edged past the Chiefs on Sunday, beneficiaries of another Love masterpiece — an increasingly common sight in the 2023 season. But it was the game's final moments that drew the most intrigue, mostly because of their incredulous nature.

Jonathan Owens was whistled for an unnecessary roughness that never was on the game's final drive, penalized for crashing into a scrambling Patrick Mahomes on the field of play. Soon after, Marquez Valdes-Scantling was seemingly impeded by Green Bay cornerback Carrington Valentine on a streak play, an unabashed pass interference call in most circumstances. The umpires fell silent.

If that weren't enough, Owens then barged into Kelce's back on the final play of the game and Mahomes' Hail Mary tumbled onto the turf. And like the previous play, the contact went unrecognized by the zebras.

It was a sorry end to an enthralling contest. Love and Mahomes dueled like gladiators, each painting pictures atop the verdant green canvas.

Love was the better man on the day. He completed 25-of-36 passes for 267 yards, three touchdowns and no interceptions. It's his fourth game with three touchdowns and no interceptions this year. That's tied for most in the league.

It was beautiful, chaotic, messy and eye-catching. Above all else, it was cold. And although there are a number of ballads to be written about the calls that could have been, for now, the Packers won't care. They're back in the postseason race, all on the back of their lithe young hurler.

Chiefs vs. Packers results, highlights from 'Sunday Night Football'

(All times Eastern)

11:28 p.m.: Game. Set. Match. Mahomes' Hail Mary falls harmlessly to the turf, giving the Packers a much-needed win. What a game!

11:25 p.m.: Proper make-up call by the referees there, as Valdez-Scantling was almost certainly impeded illegally while streaking down the field. Should've been a pass interference. It wasn't, though. And now, Kansas City could be on the brink of losing.

11:22 p.m.: Whole lot of laundry left back on the field. Looked like Rashee Rice may have fumbled the rock while scampering down the field. However, he was ruled down with contact. At which point Pacheco threw a punch at Nixon, prompting an ejection. Nice...

11:18 p.m.: Referees make a baffling unnecessary roughness call on Jonathan Owens, gifting the Chiefs an extra 20 yards. That could prove vital.

11:14 p.m.: FIELD GOAL! And it's good! Right down the middle! What a kick by Carlson. Packers lead grows back to eight.

Packers 27, Chiefs 19

11:12 p.m.: Love takes a sack 10 yards behind the line-of-scrimmage, setting up a rather difficult 48-yard attempt for Carlson on fourth down. The Packers desperately need their rookie kicker to come through in the clutch.

11:11 p.m.: Watson goes down with yet another injury. This one looked like it could be a hamstring niggle. Really unfortunate end to the game for the second-year wideout, who was enjoying one of the best games of his young career.

10:59 p.m.: INTERCEPTION! It looked like the Chiefs were on the brink of another lengthy drive. At least until Mahomes tossed a pass toward Packers corner Keisean Nixon. The noted return man pulled down an over-the-shoulder grab to break Missourians' hearts. What a grab. What a moment!

10:53 p.m.: FIELD GOAL! Anders Carlson sinks his 40-yard attempt as Green Bay continues to set the pace. Chiefs still in striking distance, though.

Packers 24, Chiefs 19

10:52 p.m.: Mike Danna sends Love spiraling after frolicking into the pocket on third down. Just what the doctor ordered if you're Kansas City, who look poised to force the Packers to bring their field goal team out.

10:50 p.m.: Malik Heath drops a defender after fielding a pass on a curl pattern. Green Bay has found a real rhythm in its latest drive.

10:46 p.m.: Another inch-perfect throw from Love to Doubs. Throwing off your back foot has never looked so clean.

Romeo Doubs got much more than the 16 yards needed for the first down

10:43 p.m.: For the first time today, the ball is punted following a three-and-out. Green Bay defense held firm on that one. Love has a chance to add to the Packers' lead.

10:39 p.m.: For the first time in ages, the Packers fail to conjure up any magic on offense. Chiefs finally get the ball. back with a chance to take the lead.

10:28 p.m.: TOUCHDOWN! Mahomes finds Noah Gray with a peel route to bring the Packers' lead back down to two. Your move, Mr. Love.

Packers 21, Chiefs 12

10:10 p.m.: Love places a throw perfectly between triple coverage, hitting a streaking Romeo Doubs to put Green Bay on the doorstep of the end zone once more. What a phenomenal throw by the youngster.

10:03 p.m.: Love hits Dillon out in the front, who makes his defender miss before racing beyond the marker for a first down. The first-year starter continues to make the right play in the cold. Strong display thus far.

9:57 p.m.: TOUCHDOWN! Chiefs get into the end zone finally, courtesy of a Pacheco scamper through the midway. He's unable to find the target again on the two-point conversion, however, keeping the Packers in control (just barely).

Packers 14, Chiefs 12

9:54 p.m.: Mahomes does it again! Delicate touch pass between the Magic Man and Kelce results in yet another first down on third-and-long. Kelce's up to 81 yards on four grabs. Kansas City is threatening to breach into the red zone.

9:47 p.m.: Mahomes hits Kelce with a floated effort as the Chiefs open the first half with a flourish. Need more of that going forward.

End of second quarter: Packers 14, Chiefs 6

9:10 p.m.: FIELD GOAL! Kansas City's explosive offense has been held in check thus far. Despite showing flashes of what they can accomplish, the Chiefs were held to another field goal in this one. Yikes...

Packers 14. Chiefs 6

9:00 p.m.: TOUCHDOWN! Green Bay's second drive of the game ends much like the first, with Love firing an arrow to Watson to add to Green Bay's early advantage.

Packers 14, Chiefs 3

End of first quarter: Packers 7, Chiefs 3

8:50 p.m.: FIELD GOAL! Harrison Butler sinks his field goal after a pair of sacks relegate Kansas City to bringing its special teams onto the field.

Packers 7, Chiefs 3

8:48 p.m.: Isiah Pacheco gallops on the outside to grab a heap of yardage. Kansas City is on the brink of a score.

8:47 p.m.: Great composure by Mahomes and Marquez Valdez-Scantling, both of whom combine to keep Kansas City in the ascendancy.

8:45 p.m.: Clyde Edwards-Helair keeps the chains moving after strutting through the trenches on third down. KC is into Green Bay territory.

8:42 p.m.: Patrick Mahomes leads the Chiefs out for their first possession. And it's gotten off to a good start thus far; two plays, two first downs for Kansas City.

8:39 p.m.: TOUCHDOWN! Love hits Ben Sims for his first career touchdown! Great throw, great catch, and an even better drive. Doesn't get much slicker than that to start the game.

First NFL TD for Ben Sims ✅

First Lambeau Leap for Ben Sims ✅

Packers 7, Chiefs 0

8:35 p.m.: Dontayvion Wicks makes the catch though traffic, racing beyond the first down marker to bring Green Bay on the cusp of the end zone.

8:28 p.m.: A.J. Dillon bursts through the mire to pick up the first down on third-and-short. Decent start for the Packers so far, who have climbed down the gridiron with relative ease in the opening few minutes.

8:26 p.m.: Wonderful pitch and catch between Love and one of his favorite targets, Christian Watson. Good for a 20-yard gain. Green Bay trots into Kansas City territory.

8:23 p.m.: The ball tumbles into the end zone and away we go! Love and the Packers spill onto the field to lead off tonight's matchup in the cold.

8:22 p.m.: Jordan Love's first career start came against the Chiefs in 2021. He'll be hoping for a better showing this time around. Given the level that he's been playing at in recent weeks, he has a good chance of doing so.

8:00 p.m.: Will Kelce put on a showcase in front of her beau? The world will find out soon enough...

sports,Bryan Murphy,2023-10-19T22:00:04+00:00,"'Tis the season for horrors, and the Jaguars left New Orleans surviving a late scare against the Saints on ""Thursday Night Football."" '

Jacksonville improved to 5-2 on the season, as Doug Pederson's crew held off a late comeback attempt from New Orleans, emerging with a 31-24 victory. The win pushes the Jaguars' winning streak to four games, while the loss dropped the Saints' record to 3-4.

The Jaguars controlled a majority of the game, getting out to an early lead in the first half and entering the fourth quarter up 24-9. At the time, the Saints offense was completely out of sync, as quarterback Derek Carr had just thrown a pick-six to Foye Oluokun and was struggling to connect with any of his key weapons, outside of running back Alvin Kamara.

However, Trevor Lawrence and the Jags let the Saints stick around, failing to put away the opposition. It led to two fourth quarter touchdowns by New Orleans that tied the game with less than six minutes to go, and the momentum had fully shifted at Caesers SuperDome to the home side.

That was until Christian Kirk came through for the Jaguars. After the two sides exchanged punts, the wide receiver broke loose for a 44-yard touchdown, re-taking the lead for Jacksonville with 3:08 left to go.

The Saints nearly tied the game up in the final seconds of the game. Tight end Foster Moreau had a touchdown in his fingertips on third-and-goal, but he could not come up with the catch. A pass to Chris Olave on fourth down was broken up, as the Jags held on for the win.

Jaguars vs. Saints live results, highlights from 'Thursday Night Football'

(All times Eastern)

Final: Jaguars 31, Saints 24

11:25 p.m. — Three QB kneels from Lawrence, and the Jaguars leave New Orleans with a win. Ultimately the offense for the Saints could not put things together until it was too little, too late. Jacksonville improves to 5-2, while New Orleans drops to 3-4.

11:23 p.m. — Carr targets Olave on the outside, but Buster Brown locks up the Saints wide receiver and it falls incomplete. That's going to do it, as the Saints come close to making an incredible comeback, but fall just short.

11:21 p.m. — Oh, so close for Moreau. On third-and-goal, the tight end is left wide open in the back left corner, Carr finds him, but it goes off Moreau's fingertips and incomplete. It'll be fourth down for the Saints with 25 seconds left.

11:19 p.m. — After an Olave catch picks up eight, Kamara rushes for four to get the Saints to the six-yard line. There's under a minute left in regulation with the Saints down seven.

11:17 p.m. — Kamara has been excellent tonight for the Saints, in both the passing and running game. He takes a handoff for 18 yards, giving New Orleans a first down at the Jacksonville 18-yard line.

11:12 p.m. — Carr hits Hill for 18 yards, then tosses two dump offs to Kamara for gains of nine and seven. The two-minute warning hits with the Saints having the ball at the Jaguars' 41-yard line.

Jaguars 31, Saints 24

11:12 p.m. — Touchdown! Kirk sends the SuperDome into silence, as he takes a short-yard pass from Lawrence and weaves through the Saints defense for a 44-yard touchdown. Jacksonville finally cracks through a New Orleans defense that had its number in the second half to retake the lead with 3:08 to go.

11:06 p.m. — Just like that, the Saints are forced to punt after three plays, but the concern is Carr. As he scrambled to his right on third down, he appeared to reach for his groin after throwing the incomplete pass. He stayed down for a bit, spoke to the training staff, and eventually walked his way to the sidelines.

11:03 p.m. — The Jaguars pick up a first down, but are stopped on three straight plays and will have to punt. I mentioned this earlier, Jacksonville let New Orleans hang around and now are paying for it. The Saints have the ball with 4:30 to go.

Jaguars 24, Saints 24

10:57 p.m. — Touchdown! Bang-bang-TD. Carr tosses one for Thomas at the back of the end zone, and the receiver is able to stay inbounds for the score. New Orleans wasted no time at all getting down field and in the end zone. The Saints go for two, and Carr lofts one to a wide open Kamara to tie the game. After looking dead in the water, the Saints have come alive.

10:56 p.m. — Carr connects with Thomas on the first play of the drive for a gain of 17. He follows that up by finding Hill at the 18-yard line for the 19-yard reception.

10:54 p.m. — Turnover on downs! Lawrence gives it to Etienne Jr. on a read option, but the Saints wrap up by the running back before he can get the first down. Stop me if you've heard me say this — the Saints' defense is the sole reason this is remains a close game. This time, the unit sets up Carr and the offense at their own 47-yard line with 7:29 left.

10:53 p.m. — Etienne Jr. gets three straight runs, but on third down, he is tackled inches short of a first down. Pederson is electing to keep the offense out there.

10:50 p.m. — The Saints can't catch a break. The defense stops the Jaguars on third down, but Paulson Adebo is called for pass interference, giving Jacksonville the automatic first down. The pass looked high, so Adebo felt it was uncatchable, but the officials disagree.

10:47 p.m. — After a promising last drive, Carr and Co. get nothing generated and the drive ends in a three-and-out. Carr tried his first deep ball of the night, but it appeared Olave pulled up on the route, increasing the frustration of the Saints QB.

10:42 p.m. — Once again, it's the Saints defense that comes through for New Orleans. The unit gets Lawrence to scramble twice, but the Jaguars can't come up with a first down and are forced to punt. The only reason why the Saints are still in this game is because of Allen's defense.

Jaguars 24, Saints 16

10:38 p.m. — Touchdown! Hill, who got the Saints near the goal line, punches it in from a yard out, thanks to an excellent block from defensive lineman Khalen Saunders. By far, the best drive of the night for New Orleans, and the offense converts on fourth down to six points. Grupe doinks the extra point off the uprights and in to make it 24-16 with 14:21 left.

10:37 p.m. — The Saints toss it to Kamara, but he's chased down by the Evan Lloyd before getting over the end zone. New Orleans has to go for it on fourth down from a yard out.

End of the third quarter: Jaguars 24, Saints 9

10:33 p.m. — Kamara is denied twice from two yards out, and that's how the third quarter ends. The Saints have been held without a touchdown through the first three quarters, but are knocking on the door with third-and-one.

10:32 p.m. — Rayshawn Jenkins take a bad penalty in the end zone for the Jaguars, hitting Foster Moreau late on an incomplete pass. The Saints move up to just two yards out.

10:31 p.m. — Taysom Hill gets the call on back-to-back plays for the Saints. Taking it himself each time, he picks up gains of one and five to move the chains.

10:26 p.m. — Allen continues to be aggressive on fourth down. After a Kamara catch comes up two yards short, he takes a handoff on fourth down and moves the chains. New Orleans has the ball at the Jaguars' nine-yard line with just over two minutes to go in the quarter.

10:25 p.m. — This has been by far the Saints' best drives, and it's been up-tempo with Carr getting the ball quickly out of his hands.

10:17 p.m. — After the pick-six, Carr completes six passes in a row, and the Saints have made their way swiftly into Jacksonville territory.

Jaguars 24, Saints 9

10:17 p.m. — Pick-six! The woes on the New Orleans offense continue, as Carr forces a throw on third that's deflected up in the air and into the arms of Foye Oluokun. The Jaguars linebacker sprints all the way to the end zone, diving for the pylon. It's getting real ugly on the Saints side, with a frustrated Carr looking completely out of sync with his weapons.

10:12 p.m. — An interesting play call for the Jaguars on third down just now. Needing six yards at their own 29, the call from the sidelines is a draw, and Etienne Jr. comes up less than a yard short of a first down. Pederson elects not to go for it, and the Jaguars will punt away. Jacksonville is playing a dangerous game, letting New Orleans stick around.

Jaguars 17, Saints 9

10:06 p.m. — Field goal! Grupes improves to three of four on the night, booting a 42-yarder. The Saints cut into the Jags' lead, making it a one-score content again.

10:06 p.m. — After Hill got the Saints down to the Jacksonville 23, a penalty on second down pushes New Orleans 10 yards back, and the offense can't move the chains. Once again, the Saints have to kick a field field.

10:02 p.m. — Taysom Hill hasn't been used really at all this game, but the QB/TE hybrid keeps a read option and barrels for a gain of six yards, down to the Jacksonville 23. For the first time since the opening drive, the Saints have been able to pick up multiple first downs and drive down the field, getting close to the red zone.

10:01 p.m. — The Saints needed half a yard, Kamara gave them 17. The Saints running back sprints downfield for a major gain on fourth down.

10 p.m. — The Saints can't convert on third down, coming up a half a yard short. However, Allen is keeping the offense out to go for it on fourth down. New Orleans is now one for nine tonight on third down.

9:58 p.m. — The second half is underway in New Orleans. The Saints get the ball to start the half, in desperate need of generating anything on offense.

End of first half: Jaguars 17, Saints 6

9:44 p.m. — Carr fumbles the ball, it's recovered by one of his lineman, and that's how the first half ends. A fitting end for the Saints, who could get nothing going on offense, leaving the field to boos from the New Orleans fans.

Jaguars 17, Saints 6

9:42 p.m. — Field goal! McManus sinks his first attempt of the night, extending the Jaguars lead to 11 with just 32 seconds left in the half. Pederson's aggression pays off, as the fake punt leads to three points.

9:41 p.m. — Call reversed! After review, the officials deem the ball hit the ground as Lattimore was trying to make the completion, ruling the play an incomplete pass rather than an interception. With it being fourth down, McManus comes out for a field goal.

9:38 p.m. — Interception! Marcus Lattimore comes up with a massive play for the Saints, picking off Lawrence down inside the 10-yard line with just 34 seconds to go in the half. Lawrence was looking for Agnew, but Lattimore dove in front of the receiver for the pick. The officials are going to review to see if Lattimore maintained possession, otherwise it may be an incomplete pass.

9:36 p.m. — Fake punt! Not so fast! Pederson dips into bag of tricks and calls for the fake punt. Logan Cooke connects with Tim Jones for a 17-yard gain, and the Jaguars keep possession. That took some stones on Pederson's part, but it pays off, giving Lawrence and the offense a chance to find the end zone before the end of the half.

9:35 p.m. — The Saints stop the Jaguars on third down, forcing yet another punt.

9:32 p.m. — Two completions, two first downs for the Jaguars. Most importantly, Kirk and Engram both got out of bounds, stopping the clock. The Jaguars have all three timeouts with under two minutes to go.

Jaguars 14, Saints 6

9:29 p.m. — Field goal! Grupe hits his second field goal of the night, and the Saints add another three points to their score.

9:29 p.m. — New Orleans electing for the points, as Grupe comes out for a 35-yard attempt.

9:26 p.m. — The third down struggles continue for the Saints. Carr scrambles on third-and-eight, but only picks up three yards. It's clear that Carr and his receivers aren't quite on the same page. As the two-minute warning hits, it will be fourth-and-five for the Saints.

9:24 p.m. — This time, Allen's aggressive decision works, as the Saints get the first down thanks to a 17-yard catch and run by Kamara.

9:23 p.m. — The boos are raining down at the SuperDome, as it's another failed third down for the Saints. However, they are going to go for it on fourth-and-three.

9:20 p.m. — The Saints defense comes through again for Dennis Allen and Co., forcing the second-straight, three-and-out for the Jaguars. A bad penalty by Antonio Johnson on the punt gives the Saints extra yards, as he runs into returner Rashid Shaheed. It's a 15-yard penalty, and New Orleans starts at the Jacksonville 46-yard line.

9:15 p.m. — Olave is the target again on third down, but Carr's pass attempt is broken up by Tre Herndon. The Saints have to punt the ball away as the second quarter reaches the halfway point, with 7:17 left in the half.

9:12 p.m. — On the first offensive play of the drive, Carr dumps it off to Kamara, who runs for a gain of 21 yards.

9:10 p.m. — The New Orleans defense comes up with a big stop, forcing the Jaguars to a three-and-out. The Saints get the ball back unscathed after failing on the fourth down attempt.

9:05 p.m. — The Saints cannot convert on fourth down, as Carr's pass attempt to Chris Olave is tipped away from the receiver. The Jaguars get the bal at their own 44.

9:05 p.m. — Darious Williams bats away a third down pass attempt to Michael Thomas, but Dennis Allen is staying aggressive, keeping the offense out on fourth-and-three.

9:03 p.m. — An 18-yard completion from Carr to Foster Moreau brings the Saints to their own 48-yard line.

Jaguars 14, Saints 3

8:58 p.m. — Touchdown! Etienne Jr. takes a pitch and races 17 yards down the sideline for the score, his second TD of the game. The running back has found the end zone six times in his last three games, as Jacksonville extends its lead early in the second quarter.

8:57 p.m. — If the knee is bothering Lawrence, it's hard to tell. The Jaguars QB escapes pressure in the pocket and takes off down field for a run of 26 yards, the second-longest run of his career.

8:55 p.m. — The Jaguars bring out a little razzle dazzle. Kirk takes a handoff, tosses it back to Lawrence and the QB finds Agnew for nine yards.

End of the first quarter: Jaguars 7, Saints 3

8:52 p.m. — Lawrence connects with Kirk for nine yards on third-and-three, and that's how the first quarter ends.

Jaguars 7, Saints 3

8:47 p.m. — Field goal! Grupe knocks down the 23-yard chip shot, and New Orleans is on the board with 1:26 left in the first quarter.

8:46 p.m. — Despite the excellent field position, the Saints cannot convert six yards out and instead have to settle for three points.

8:44 p.m. — A Kamara completion goes for seven yards, and the Saints have first-and-goal at the Jaguars six-yard line.

8:40 p.m. — Fumble! Tevaughn Campbell runs into Agnew on the punt, forcing the Jaguars returner to muff the ball and the Saints recover yet again. Back-to-back breaks for New Orleans, who takes over possession deep into Jacksonville territory with 3:36 left in the first quarter.

Jamal Agnew was ready to receive the punt but his own teammate came in and just completely took him out.



Some messy football.pic.twitter.com/UxavIZXbZf — Ari Meirov (@MySportsUpdate) October 20, 2023

8:40 p.m. — The Saints can't take advantage of the fumble, as the Jaguars force a three-and-out.

8:37 p.m. — Fumble! On the Jaguars first offensive play after the missed Saints field goal, Kirk loses control of the ball after securing a catch and the Saints come up with the recovery. It was Paulson Adebo that punched the ball out. New Orleans gets the ball right back at their own 41-yard line.

8:33 p.m. — Missed field goal! Grupe pushes his attempt to the right, and the Saints come up with nothing on their opening drive. The rookie has now missed three of his last five kicks.

8:33 p.m. — Jacksonville blitzes on third-and-seven and the pressure forces Carr to throw the ball away. New Orleans will have to settle for a 51-yard field goal attempt by rookie Blake Grupe.

8:29 p.m. — Carr uses his legs to pick up another first down and get across midfield. The Saints QB certainly isn't known for scrambling, but he gets the job done by rolling out to his right and rushing for a gain of 10 yards.

8:28 p.m. — The Saints narrowly avoid a three-and-out on their opening drive, as Derek Carr finds Alvin Kamara for a gain of five yards on third-and-4.

Jaguars 7, Saints 0

8:23 p.m. — Touchdown! Etienne Jr. barrels in from two yards out, and just like that, the Jaguars are on the board. Lawrence and Co. made it look easy against a Saints defense who had not given up an opening drive TD since last season. Brandon McManus' extra point is good, and it's a seven-point lead just 5:16 into the game for Jacksonville.

CBS affiliate WJAX (Channel 47) will career the game to those in the Jacksonville area while viewers in the New Orleans market can catch the program on WDSU (Channel 6), an NBC affiliate.

Amazon's broadcast crew for ""Thursday Night Football"" will consist of Al Michaels (play-by-play), Kirk Herbstreit (color commentary) and Kaylee Hartung (sideline reporter). The trio is in their second season working together.

Viewers in Canada will not have to have Amazon Prime to access ""Thursday Night Football"" in 2023. They will be able to watch the games on DAZN.","Jaguars vs. Saints live score, updates, highlights from NFL 'Thursday Night Football' game",https://www.sportingnews.com/us/nfl/news/jaguars-saints-live-score-highlights-thursday-night-football/f1a6cc7fef54c6696ee03009,Sporting News
sports,Kyle Irving,2023-11-19T23:00:04+00:00,"The Broncos completed a major comeback in the Mile High City.

Both Denver and Minnesota entered ""Sunday Night Football"" on red-hot win streaks but only one team could keep the momentum rolling. It looked like it was going to be Joshua Dobbs and the Vikings for the majority of the contest, but the Broncos wouldn't let up.

Trailing by eight points going into the final frame, Denver's offense finally woke up in the game's biggest moment. The Broncos hadn't found the end zone all night but Russell Wilson still found a way to lead an impressive game-winning drive in the final three minutes.

Courtland Sutton was as clutch as can be, coming up with a key catch on fourth down to keep the drive alive. When Denver brought the ball into the red zone where it had stalled out several times throughout the night, Wilson went right back to his guy Sutton.

Sutton hauled in a monster touchdown reception to give the Broncos a one-point lead with a minute remaining, and Dobbs had run out of magic. Denver forced a turnover on downs on Minnesota's final drive, extending its win streak to four games while handing the Vikings their first loss in five weeks.

Vikings 20, Broncos 15

11:02 p.m.: FIELD GOAL — Greg Joseph knocks it in from 30 yards. The Vikings' offense was moving, and it did its job by chewing a lot of clock on a 14-play, seven-minute and 20-second drive. Minnesota stalled out on Denver's 12-yard line, settling for a field goal.

Can the Vikings' defense keep the Broncos out of the end zone as it has all night? The drive of the game is coming up.

10:57 p.m.: The spot on the field was overturned! Ty Chandler was ruled just short of the line to gain, setting up a 4th & inches. The Vikings decided to go for it and Joshua Dobbs picked up the first down on a QB sneak.

10:54 p.m.: Ty Chandler continues to rumble. The spell RB picked up a massive gain on 3rd & 20 and it appeared that he got the first down, but the spot on the field is under review. This could be a crucial call.

10:48 p.m.: It looked like it was going to be a three-and-out for the Vikings offense but a fake punt has kept the drive alive! Ty Chandler picked up 31 yards on a gutsy call from head coach Kevin O'Connell to bring the ball into Denver's territory.

Vikings 17, Broncos 15

10:43 p.m.: FIELD GOAL — Will Lutz knocks one in from 28 yards, his fifth made field goal of the day. Lutz has been the Broncos' lone source of offense, bringing Denver within one score with 10:37 to play in the game.

10:38 p.m.: INTERCEPTION! Joshua Dobbs was hit as he threw and Broncos CB Ja'Quan McMillan came up with the pick. It was LB Josey Jewell who brought the pressure on Dobbs. Denver takes over from the Vikings' 9-yard line after McMillan picked up nine yards on the interception return.

Vikings 17, Broncos 12

10:34 p.m.: FIELD GOAL — Will Lutz buries his fourth field goal of the day, this time from 37 yards. Lutz has been automatic in this one, going a perfect 4-for-4 to account for all of Denver's points.

10:32 p.m.: Penalties kill. The Broncos picked up a first down on a Russell Wilson QB sneak on 3rd & 1, but an illegal formation penalty set them back four yards. On the ensuing 3rd down attempt, Vikings LB D.J. Wonnum brought down Wilson for a sack. Here comes the field goal unit.

End of third quarter: Vikings 17, Broncos 9

10:26 p.m.: The Vikings' turnover has put a jolt of life into the Broncos' offense. Javonte Williams rushed for 18 yards on the first play of the drive, then Russell Wilson connected with Jerry Jeudy for 19 yards to get the wheels turning. It will be 1st & 10 from Minnesota's 21-yard line when the fourth quarter begins.

10:21 p.m.: FUMBLE! Alexander Mattison coughed up the football on an inside handoff and it was recovered by the Broncos. Denver takes over from its own 34 on a much-needed turnover.

10:13 p.m.: The Broncos offense is really struggling to move the ball on some of these drives tonight. It's another three-and-out after Russell Wilson couldn't link up with Marvin Mims Jr. on 3rd & 3. The Vikings will take over from their own 25 with 6:23 remaining in the quarter after a touchback on the punt.

10:01 p.m.: The Vikings are moving the chains. They've picked up two first downs in five plays, gaining 43 yards in the process. Alexander Mattison picked up 23 yards on the ground, and Joshua Dobbs and Jordan Addison connected on an 18-yard pass to pick up the bulk of the yardage.

9:56 p.m.: A holding penalty derailed the Broncos' drive as they came up way short on a 3rd & 20 attempt. Minnesota will take over from its own 31 after a 19-yard punt return from Brandon Powell.

9:24 p.m.: Joshua Dobbs connected on a 17-yard pass to Jordan Addison and a 10-yard pass to TJ Hockenson to bring Minnesota to its own 48 at the two-minute warning. It will be 2nd & 5 coming out of the break.

9:21 p.m.: Joshua Dobbs and center Garrett Bradbury have had a few bad exchanges when the newly acquired QB is under center. Dobbs just fumbled his second snap of the game but has recovered both of them.

Vikings 10, Broncos 6

9:18 p.m.: FIELD GOAL — Will Lutz gets another 31-yarder to go for the Broncos. Russell Wilson found Jerry Jeudy for a five-yard gain on 3rd & 7, coming just short of the line to gain. Head coach Sean Payton elected to kick the field goal instead of going for it on Minnesota's 12-yard line.

9:14 p.m.: Russell Wilson and Courtland Sutton connect on a 33-yard pitch and catch to give the Broncos their first big play of the game! Denver is in the red zone for the first time tonight.

Vikings 10, Broncos 3

9:08 p.m.: FIELD GOAL — Greg Joseph drills a 34-yarder to give the Vikings a 10-3 lead with 8:09 to play in the half. The Vikings' offense stalled out in the red zone as Joshua Dobbs was sacked for an 11-yard loss on 3rd & Goal.

9:06 p.m.: Joshua Dobbs has some magic in him. In a cloud of smoke in the pocket, Dobbs found TE TJ Hockenson on a 29-yard gain to pick up a first down on 3rd & 2. The big play brings the Vikings into the red zone.

9:00 p.m.: Another three-and-out for Russell Wilson and the Broncos. On 3rd & 3, Wilson was under heavy pressure and threw the ball away as he was nearly brought down for a sack. Denver punted to Minnesota's 25, where Joshua Dobbs and the offense will take over.

Vikings 7, Broncos 3

8:56 p.m.: TOUCHDOWN! Joshua Dobbs, are you kidding me?! Dobbs scrambled out right and looked like he had nowhere to go. The QB shed a tackle on the sidelines and regained his composure, finding TE Josh Oliver wide open in the end zone for a touchdown after the play broke down.

8:38 p.m.: Joshua Dobbs had the Vikings' offense moving but the Broncos' defense came up with a big stop on 3rd & 8. Minnesota had picked up 28 yards in six plays but Dobbs was nearly picked off on third down, forcing a punt. Denver will take over from its own 25-yard line after a touchback.

Broncos 3, Vikings 0

8:26 p.m.: FUMBLE! Vikings QB Joshua Dobbs attempted to pick up a first down on 3rd & 1 and he was absolutely popped by SS Kareem Jackson. LB Baron Browning pried the ball loose as Dobbs was hit and the Broncos recovered the fumble, taking over at Minnesota's 30.

sports,Vinnie Iyer,2023-12-03T21:49:04+00:00,"The NFL playoff race is heating up as the calendar flips to December, the penultimate month of the 2023 regular season. With only six weeks of games left through Week 18, 14 teams are looking to position themselves well as either division leaders or wild-card hopefuls.

Although there are some dominant teams headed to a return to the playoffs, most scenarios are in flux with seeding and potential entrants. Here's a look at the updated NFL playoff picture during a 13-game slate with six teams on bye, now after Week 13:

POWER RANKINGS: 49ers jump Eagles at top; Packers, Colts keep rising as Chiefs, Steelers fade for Week 14

NFL standings after Week 13

AFC playoff picture

1.. Miami Dolphins (9-3), first place, AFC East. The Dolphins matched the Ravens' record in their dominant road victory at the Commanders. For now they have the conference record tiebreaker to jump into this spot. With beating Washington, they opened up a 3-game division lead on the idle Bills.

2. Baltimore Ravens (9-3), first place, AFC North. The Ravens went into their bye with a half-game lead for home-field advantage and the lone playoff bye, over three teams right behind them. The tiebreakers, however, will shake things up a bit depending on which of two favored teams, the Chiefs and Jaguars, join the Dolphins in winning in separate matchups. The Ravens also lead the Steelers by 1.5 games in the division.

3. Kansas City Chiefs (8-4), first place, AFC West. The Chiefs have wins over the Jaguars and Dolphins to help them in the tiebreakers. They will win the division again and push for No. 1. But losing to the Packers on the road in Week 13 keeps them as No. 3 as the Jaguars lost on Monday night to stay behind them.

4. Jacksonville Jaguars (8-4), first place, AFC South. The Jaguars had a chance to match the Dolphins and Ravens on Monday night but their home overtime loss to the Bengals dropped them behind the also losing Chiefs, to whom they lost. With the upset, Jacksonville also saw its division lead drop to one over Indianapolis and Houston.

5. Pittsburgh Steelers (7-5), second place, AFC North. The Steelers lost Kenny Pickett and all their offensive promise in one fell swoop against the Cardinals, also hurt by the weather in the shocking upset at home. They remain here, however, because of the Browns also losing.

6. Indianapolis Colts (7-5) second place, AFC South. The Colts kept up their surprise playoff momentum, still with a head-to-head tiebreaker ahead of the Texans, with a win over the Titans in Tennessee in Week 13. The Colts don't have a rematch with the Texans until Week 18 in Indianapolis.

7. Cleveland Browns (7-5), third place, AFC North. The Browns also lost to a lesser overall NFC West foe in the Rams, only on the road. Joe Flacco tried to get their offense going but now the concern is the defense falling apart and regressing at the wrong time.

Who's in the hunt?

8. Houston Texans (7-5)

9. Denver Broncos (6-6)

10. Buffalo Bills (6-6)

11. Cincinnati Bengals (6-6)

12. Los Angeles Chargers (5-7)

13. Las Vegas Raiders (5-7)

14. New York Jets (4-8)

15. Tennessee Titans (4-8)

The Texans beat the Broncos Houston in a key wild-card determining matchup in Week 13. The Bills and Raiders are off to regroup for a run, while the Bengals are staying resilient without Joe Burrow. The Chargers won on the road at the Patriots to maintain a playoff pulse, but the Titans and Jets lose close games at home.

NFC playoff picture

1. Philadelphia Eagles (10-2), first place, NFC East. The Eagles fell for the second time this season as their run of beating high-quality opponents in comeback fashion ended in getting routed by the 49ers at home. They now lead the division by only one game over the Cowboys and are in real danger of losing home-field advantage and the lone bye to the 49ers, too.

2. San Francisco 49ers (9-3), first place, NFC West. The 49ers' red-hot ways since getting fully healthy around Brock Purdy after their bye continue with a dominant offensive performance against the Eagles. They made a statement that they are the new team to beat in the conference, wherever they play. Up three games on the Rams and Seahawks, another division title is coming, too.

3. Detroit Lions (9-3), first place, NFC North. The Lions are still in great shape to win the division with a 3-game lead over the Vikings and the Packers after beating the Saints in New Orleans in Week 13. But they're looking more like the No. 2 seed will be their ceiling.

4. Atlanta Falcons (6-6), first place, NFC South. The Falcons are in control of the NFL's weakest division thanks to beating the Saints and earning the head-to-head tiebreaker in Week 12. They got to .500 and increased their lead to a full game by beating the Jets in Week 13.

5. Dallas Cowboys (9-3), second place, NFC East. The Cowboys opened Week 13 by rallying to beat the Seahawks on Thursday night, keeping the heat on the losing Eagles ahead of them before hosting that team in Dallas in Week 14. They can finish No. 1, No, 2 or No. 3 if they win the division and are locked into No. 5 again otherwise.

6. Minnesota Vikings (6-6), second place, NFC North. The Vikings jumped up a spot during their bye with the Seahawks losing on Thursday night to match their record on Thursday night. They have the tiebreaker over the three other .500 NFC teams based on conference record, but right behind them is the team in third place in the division.

7. Green Bay Packers (6-6), third place, NFC North. The Packers moved into the final playoff spot thanks to having the second-best conference record after the Vikings, to whom they already lost but face again in Minnesota in Week 17. The Packers also hold key wins over the Rams and Saints in the wild-card race.

Who's in the hunt?

8. Los Angeles Rams (6-6)

9. Seattle Seahawks (6-6)

10. Tampa Bay Buccaneers (5-7)

11. New Orleans Saints (5-7)

12. New York Giants (4-8)

13. Chicago Bears (4-8)

14. Washington Commanders (4-9)

The Rams and Seahawks are the best wild-card bets here now, while the Saints and Buccaneers will still have their sights on making the playoffs via still winning the weak South over the Falcons.","NFL standings: Updated AFC, NFC playoff picture for Week 13 of 2023 season",https://www.sportingnews.com/us/nfl/news/nfl-standings-2023-playoff-picture-week-13/d51dfe0fbd879c7a1bbadb06,Sporting News
sports,Kyle Bonn,2023-10-04T23:33:00+00:00,"Without Lionel Messi, Inter Miami have looked exceedingly mortal. They put in a 90-minute performance littered with individual mistakes, and the Chicago Fire made them pay, winning 4-1 via braces from Xherdan Shaqiri and substitute Maren Haile-Selassie.

The result boosts Chicago’s postseason hopes significantly, moving them into a playoff position in the Eastern Conference standings.

Inter Miami’s playoff hopes, conversely, are now on life support, needing to win out in their final three games and get outside help. The club is winless in four games with Messi out injured, and it has seen their chances at a postseason berth nearly evaporate.

Shaqiri’s brace was the biggest talking point for the hosts, as the former Liverpool midfielder has not always been at his best since joining MLS, but in front of a record Chicago Fire crowd at Soldier Field, he rose to the occasion.

Chicago Fire vs. Inter Miami: Second Half

90th min: Facundo Farias is booked for a hip check on Miguel Navarro, which might have been a retaliation foul for Navarro's jawing at Sergio Busquets.

Three minutes of added time are shown on the board.

83rd min: Referee Joe Dickerson has to step between Sergio Busquets and Miguel Navarro as the two are jawing at each other. It wasn't hard to read Navarro's lips as he walked away, and his words aren't repeatable here.

Frank Klopas withdraws Fabian Herbers and brings on an extra defender in Carlos Teran.

78th min: A crowd of 62,124 was announced for tonight's match, blowing out the old Chicago Fire record and setting a new club record at Soldier Field. They didn't get to see Lionel Messi play, but they got to see their home team put on a rousing performance!

73rd min: GOAL! CHICAGO FIRE! Xherdan Shaqiri has his second as he skewers Inter Miami to put the match away! It's given away in midfield by Facundo Farias, and Gaston Gimenez feeds Shaqiri through to begin the transitional play. Shaqiri, splitting two defenders, does it himself, cutting inside onto his left foot and then burying the shot inside the near post past a helpless Drake Callender.

This one's over, and Inter Miami's playoff chances are on life support!

Shaqiri brace ✔️

68th min: Suddenly trailing by two goals, Gerardo Martino makes a pair of changes, bringing on Jean Mota and Nick Stefanelli for Dixon Arroyo and Robert Taylor.

66th min: GOAL! CHICAGO FIRE! The hosts take a commanding lead on another defensive calamity at the back for Inter Miami! The substitute Maren Haile-Selassie has his second, and it's all too easy for the Chicago Fire! A lateral cross from Fabian Herbers is inch-perfect to thread around both defenders, and Haile-Selassie slides in to finish.

Drake Callender gets a slight touch on the ball, but he can't keep it out.

Another one for Maren Haile-Selassie! 🔥

62nd min: GOAL! CHICAGO FIRE! The substitute snatches back the lead, and Inter Miami are made to pay for their poor misses!

A sensational pass vertically from Fabian Herbers feeds through Maren Haile-Selassie, with Serhiy Kryvtsov completely failing to see the runner breeze by him. The finish is cool and the hosts are in front.

61st min: Inter Miami are going for the jugular now. Robert Taylor's cheeky backheel gets the ball to Facundo Farias, but his shot is blocked. It's all sauce from the visitors right now, and Chicago are under siege.

59th min: Chance, Inter Miami! BENJA CREMASCHI PUTS A GOLDEN OPPORTUNITY WIDE! Moments after Facundo Farias misses, Josef Martinez again unlocks the Chicago Fire defense but with only the goalkeeper to beat, Cremaschi misses the target across the face of goal! He HAD to take the lead!

58th min: Chance, Inter Miami! Josef Martinez squares to Facundo Farias on the break, but the young Argentine misses wide left! That's a terrible miss with the goal gaping! The chance was there, as he was free on goal!

55th min: Chicago coach Frank Klopas makes the first substitution, withdrawing Brian Gutierrez and bringing on Maren Haile-Selassie. The broadcast reports that Gutierrez was pulled due to a sore knee.

52nd min: PENALTY, INTER MIAMI! Handball on Jonathan Dean who blocks a shot by Benja Cremaschi! He is lucky to only get a yellow card here, as he was prone on the ground and had his arms outstretched as he turned his back to the shot.

Josef Martinez steps up to the spot...GOAL! INTER MIAMI! The penalty is slammed into the back of the net, with Chris Brady going the wrong way as well! Chicago had their lead for just three minutes.

50th min: GOAL! CHICAGO FIRE! DeAndre Yedlin completely loses his runner at the back post, and Xherdan Shaqiri makes him pay! The U.S. international, up the field from the attack, had no clue that Shaqiri was making his run and dogged it back in transition.

SHAQIRI 🎶 SHAQIRI 🎶



What a sequence from the @ChicagoFire to set up the opening goal against Inter Miami. pic.twitter.com/Snix7YI1CK — Major League Soccer (@MLS) October 5, 2023

47th min: Robert Taylor gives a loud grunt audible on the broadcast and is holding his shoulder after taking a relatively innocuous touch off his chest. He looks to be ok after a few moments.

Kickoff: They're back under way at Soldier Field, but before kickoff Gerardo Martino gets a weird yellow card from the referee. He came straight out to the center circle to discuss things with the official, and it appeared that he was chastised for how late Inter Miami returned to the pitch from the locker room.

Chicago head coach Frank Klopas tells the Apple TV+ broadcast that he wants his team to be ""more calm on the ball."" He acknowledges that they've had their chances, but haven't taken them yet.

HALFTIME: Chicago Fire 0-0 Inter Miami

No score at the break. The Chicago Fire had the better chances, but neither side really took a firm hold of the match for an extended period of time.

""We have to play further forward, we played side to side too much,"" Inter Miami head coach Gerardo Martino told the Apple TV+ broadcast as he headed into the locker room. There's a lot riding on these next 45 minutes.

HT: Fairly dull first half for Miami.



Not too much going forward, too sideways.



Desperately need some combination play in the final third.



Expect some attacking changes in the second half. #InterMiamiCF — Alex Windley (@aaw_1998) October 5, 2023

Around the rest of the league, the New York Red Bulls have picked up a massive three points off Eastern Conference leaders FC Cincinnati with a 2-1 win, while CF Montreal grabbed a last-gasp equalizer against the Houston Dynamo, and Charlotte FC pummeled Toronto FC 3-0. Not exactly an ideal trio of results for others chasing a playoff spot.

Chicago Fire vs. Inter Miami: First Half

42nd min: Sergio Busquets picks up the first yellow card of the match for what can only be described as a football tackle on Brian Gutierrez near the center circle. Busquets has no argument there.

38th min: Chance, Chicago Fire! OFF THE INSIDE OF THE POST AND OUT! So close to an opener!

An exceptional run from Georgios Koutsias sees the Greek take a shot on goal which deflects off the foot of Serhiy Kryvtsov and slowly rolls towards the net. The deflection wrong-footed Drake Callender, but the ball agonizingly hits the inside of the woodwork and comes out, and Inter Miami clear.

35th min: The hosts have gained a foothold on this match, and have earned a few consecutive corners. Chicago screams for a penalty as the ball hits Serhiy Kryvtsov in the arm, but VAR does not intervene as his arm was down in a natural position. Four straight corners go begging.

29th min: Kamal Miller makes an exquisite block on Brian Gutierrez who appeared to be in, and had an eye for a shot to the far post. That was nearly a big chance for the hosts.

Kamal Miller has been exceptional so far tonight.#InterMiamiCF — Alex Windley (@aaw_1998) October 5, 2023

23rd min: Chance, Inter Miami! Noah Allen nearly produces the vertical ball of the century, slicing up the Fire defense to find DeAndre Yedlin streaking at the far post, and while the American international slides to keep the ball in play, which Chris Brady spills, Josef Martinez can't quite reach the loose ball before it's cleared. They were so close to slamming that home!

21st min: The Fire nearly create another chance, with two players combining down the left to beat DeAndre, but the cross to the feet of a leaping Fabian Herbers is put wide of the post. The German attempted a leaping karate kick but couldn't get the contact right.

15th min: Chance, Chicago Fire! HOW DID THE FIRE NOT SCORE?!? Drake Callender completely misreads the flight of a corner and undercuts the ball, but he recovers at the near post to keep out a shot, and then Benjamin Cremaschi gets a massive block on the follow up to see the ball pop up over the crossbar.

The hosts had the ball right on the goal mouth and couldn't capitalize!

14th min: Inter Miami look a bit cleaner in the attack now, and they have begun to trouble the Chicago attacking third. Facundo Farias nearly has a chance at the top of the penalty area, but he's dispossessed before he can pick out a pass or a shot. He had teammates streaking on goal.

11th min: Robert Taylor has Inter Miami's first shot on target of the match, which is a simple save for Chris Brady low and central.

Ted Lasso actor Brendan Hunt, a native of Chicago, is shown on the video board, which draws a hand from the crowd.

7th min: Chance, Chicago Fire! Gaston Gimenez fires over the crossbar! Great wrk by Fabian Herbers down the right sees the German cross to the middle where the Fire have two attackers against just one defender. Yet Brian Gutierrez can't control the delivery, and while it falls to Gimenez, he's under pressure by the time he gets a shot off, and it sizzles just inches over the woodwork.

5th min: This has been a sloppy start for both teams in midfield, with a lot of needless giveaways. Inter Miami have held most of the possession, but have struggled with bad turnovers. The Chicago Fire haven't yet been able to take advantage.

Kickoff: A huge game in the MLS playoff race is under way from Soldier Field! The NFL venue in the Windy City is sold out.

Chicago Fire vs. Inter Miami: Pre-match commentary, analysis, stats, and more

10 mins to kickoff: With both these clubs looking to reach the playoffs, they will be keeping a close eye on other results around the Eastern Conference tonight. They're not going according to plan.

Charlotte FC, who sat 14th coming into tonight's match, lead Toronto FC 2-0, which for the moments jumps them above Inter Miami. Additionally, the New York Red Bulls are beating Eastern Conference leaders FC Cincinnati 2-0, a shocking result that has the Red Bulls, for the moment, jump above Chicago into 11th on 37 points.

This is our kind of party 🥳@Audi I #RBNY pic.twitter.com/252EosDLp2 — New York Red Bulls (@NewYorkRedBulls) October 5, 2023

25 mins to kickoff: While much of the focus has been on Inter Miami, the Chicago Fire are fighting for a playoff spot too. They sit 11th in the table, and could jump into a postseason position with a victory tonight. A draw could do the trick too if they get help from outside.

“These are the best games to play all the time,” Chicago Fire star Xherdan Shaqiri said Monday in his media availability. “As a player, you want these kinds of final games and to play for something. We put ourselves in this position, and we have a chance to do it, so now we have to perform.”

Also, Shaqiri confirmed he's Team Messi over Team Ronaldo.

Q: Messi or Ronaldo?



🗣️Xherdan Shaqiri (Chicago Fire): “I’m always a big Messi admirer, if I have to choose now I will go with Messi. He won the WC which was the only thing he missed. So for sure Messi.”#Messi #InterMiamiCF pic.twitter.com/Tv4rVXddrU — Inter Miami FC Hub (@Intermiamicfhub) October 3, 2023

35 mins to kickoff: Finally lineups have been released, and Lionel Messi is not part of the Inter Miami squad. Otherwise, it's a regular starting XI for Gerardo Martino, with Josef Martinez up front as Leonardo Campana is out with a knock.

For Chicago, Kei Kamara is on the bench, with Georgios Koutsias slotted in up front just as he was on the weekend. Mexican playmaker Jairo Torres sits, with Fabian Herbers deployed on the right wing.

45 mins to kickoff: Lineups are now exceedingly late, but while we wait, a nod to Chicago Fire striker Kei Kamara, who could tie Landon Donovan on the all-time Major League Soccer scoring list tonight with a goal. Kamara's 144 goals are just one behind the former USMNT great, while Chris Wondolowski's 171 goals leads the league's career chart.

1 hour to kickoff: With lineups not yet released, there is finally a report regarding Lionel Messi's availability. According to Michelle Kaufman of the Miami Herald, Messi ""did not arrive with the team"" to Soldier Field. While that's not outright confirmation that he will not take part in the match, it's a very strong indication that he will not be involved tonight.

1 hour 15 mins to kick: With lineups due imminently, and nothing to indicate if Lionel Messi is involved tonight or not, the Chicago Fire media team has jokes.

We have the 🐐 in the building pic.twitter.com/aPt7b0waFq — Chicago Fire FC (@ChicagoFire) October 4, 2023

1 hour 30 mins to kick: A lot of teams have indicated that their preparation for Inter Miami varies wildly depending on whether Lionel Messi will play, but Chicago Fire midfielder Xherdan Shaqiri played his own cards close to his chest when asked if they are waiting for news on Messi's availability.

""The preparation is not going to change, we're going to prepare as normal as always,"" Shaqiri said in his pre-match availability Monday. ""Everybody is excited to play against Inter Miami. If Messi is injured or not, personally I am not thinking too much about this. Of course Inter Miami is a different team when Messi is playing or not playing, you see that in the last games when Messi is in the team they are better, but we prepare like normal for every game.""

Xherdan Shaqiri: “For me it’s clear, Messi and Ronaldo are the best players in the world… these guys are among the best athletes in the history of sport, along with Michael Jordan and Tom Brady.”#cf97 #vamosfire pic.twitter.com/puTvUqC0a1 — Alex Calabrese (@amcalabrese12) October 2, 2023

1 hour 45 mins to kick: The status of Lionel Messi is unclear, but Chicago is still feeling Messi fever!

Hi from Chicago! Not sure if Messi is here (my hunch is no), but I am here to cover the Inter Miami v Fire game, and the Messi shirt 👚 ⚽️ vendors are here, too! @MiamiHerald @HeraldSports @InterMiamiCF #InterMiamiCF #Messi𓃵 #cf97 #MLS pic.twitter.com/hp8KHzkwNB — Michelle Kaufman (@kaufsports) October 4, 2023

2 hours to kickoff: Tata Martino has played his cards extremely close to his chest when it comes to the fitness of Lionel Messi. Each week we see how tight-lipped the Inter Miami boss has been regarding Messi's injury.

Prior to tonight's match against the Chicago Fire, Martino was asked about the return of Jordi Alba, and he stated that there is a timeline in place for Alba's return. When asked if there's a timeline for Messi's return, Martino refused to acknowledge if there is.

Tata Martino when I asked about Lionel Messi's return timeline:



""I understand your desire to know the exact timelines, but if I had the exact timelines I would share them.



""I just don't have them.""

Chicago Fire vs. Inter Miami lineups & team news

Frank Klopas has rotated his two young attackers, Brian Gutierrez and Jairo Torres along with famed Swiss international Xherdan Shaqiri in the attack. He has also done his best to keep his striker stop rolling along with Kei Kamara and Georgios Koutsias alternating up front and MLS veteran Kacper Przybylko coming off the bench.

Injuries to defenders Mauricio Pineda and Miguel Navarro, plus striker Victor Bezerra, will keep them out for today's match, while Chris Mueller is done for the year with a hip problem.

Chicago Fire starting lineup (4-2-3-1): Brady (GK) — Dean, Omsberg, Teran, Navarro — Doumbia, G. Gimenez — B. Gutierrez, Shaqiri, J. Torres — Kamara.

Chicago Fire subs (9): Richey (GK), Teran, Haile-Selassie, Casas Jr, Aceves, Burks, Souquet, Przybylko, Kamara.

The status of Lionel Messi is uncertain, but it feels unlikely that he will be involved given recent matches. He could, however, be more ready for action over the weekend when Inter Miami face FC Cincinnati.

Inter Miami will definitely be without the services of both Jordi Alba and Leonardo Campana who are both out with muscle injuries. Midfielder Gregore has returned to training after months on the sideline with a foot injury, and could be involved in the coming matches as he ramps up his fitness.

Tomas Aviles is suspended for yellow card accumulation, while Ian Fray and Corentin Jean are both out for the season with ACL injuries.

Inter Miami starting lineup (4-3-3): Callender (GK) — Yedlin, Kryvtsov, Miller, Allen — Arroyo, Busquets, Cremaschi — Farias, Martinez, Taylor.

Inter Miami subs (9): Dos Santos (GK), McVey, Sailor, Ulloa, J. Mota, D. Ruiz, Sunderland, Stefanelli.

sports,Nick Brinkerhoff,2023-12-13T20:28:00+00:00,"The best part of fantasy football is watching the team you draft go out there and have a chance to win a championship, forever cementing your bragging rights over your friends for years to come. The worst part of fantasy is watching the team you drafted go out there and get injured, forget how to play the sport, and then plummet to the bottom of the standings. So if you were one of the lucky ones to reach postseason football in the fantasy world -- congratulations. If you weren't, good news -- just because the regular season has come to a close doesn't mean we can't still keep searching for ways to win. That's why we're heading over to FanDuel to craft the perfect Week 15 DFS lineup to give us something to root for all day long while our friends stress about their team faltering despite dominating for 14 weeks.

Before we break down our picks and strategy, here are the most notable scoring rules for FanDuel contests: four-point passing TDs and half-point PPR.

WEEK 15 FANTASY ADVICE:

Sleepers | Busts | Projections | Start-sit

FanDuel Picks Week 15: NFL DFS lineup for GPP tournaments

Sunday main slate, $60,000 budget

QB Matthew Stafford, Rams vs. Commanders ($7,200). Stafford returns to the friendly confines of SoFi Stadium after having to deal with the elements in Baltimore last week. After nearly pulling off the upset over the Ravens, the QB has a nice landing spot against a defense that is equivalent to the props used in training camp. Washington can't slow anyone down, and it has only gotten worse since they traded away two of their best defenders at the deadline. Stafford doesn't have the rushing upside, but he's more than capable of having a good day with his arm.

RB Rachaad White, Buccaneers @ Packers ($7,600). White stockholders are feeling pretty good right now after singing his praises all offseason. The RB has rewarded them with eight straight games of at least double-digit fantasy performances, including three straight games with at least 100 total yards. Tampa has handed the ball off to White 60 times over that stretch, something that has ticked up with each passing week. As arguably the top option in the Bucs' offense, we'd be crazy to stand in the way of White against a vulnerable Packers defense in Week 15.

WEEK 15 DFS:

DK lineup | Best values | Best stacks

RB Breece Hall, Jets @ Dolphins ($7,500). Did the Jets offense find something against the Texans? We're not quite buying in yet, but it does appear that New York's coaches figured they should stop coaching scared. With the season essentially over for Gang Green barring a miracle, the staff took the handcuffs off Zach Wilson and unleashed an offense that's been run-run-pass-punting their way to irrelevance all season long. In doing so last week, Hall was a weapon as a receiver, posting over 100 total yards for the first time since Week 5. If the Jets continue their willingness to take chances downfield and let Wilson stop being a game manager, then Hall is in line for another big day.

WR Deebo Samuel, 49ers @ Cardinals ($8,400). We'll just keep riding with Samuel down the stretch, as he isn't giving us any reason to reconsider. He has back-to-back games with 30 fantasy points and has been a man on a mission since Thanksgiving. He shouldn't have any problems continuing that run against the Cardinals on Sunday.

WEEK 15 PPR RANKINGS:

QBs | RBs | WRs | TEs | D/STs | Kickers

WR Puka Nacua, Rams vs. Commanders ($8,000). Usually, one of Nacua or Kupp has a big day, but this week it could both. Either way, we're on the Nacua train heading into Sunday since the rookie has been by far the L.A.'s most consistent weapon all season. Even with Kupp back in the fold, Stafford continues to trust Nacua. He's not seeing the 15-20 targets a game like earlier in the year, but the rookie is making the most of his seven-plus opportunities a game. Against a terrible defense, both receivers should see plenty of chances to make their mark on the game. Nacua checks in at $200 less and is arguably better than Kupp in fantasy at this stage. In a game where every dollar counts, pocketing that extra $200 can really pay off at another roster spot.

WR Rashee Rice, Chiefs @ Patriots ($6,500). There are plenty of issues with the Chiefs' receivers, but Rice is not one of them. The rookie has been very impressive through the first 14 weeks of his NFL career and hauled in yet another touchdown on Sunday to post a respectable fantasy showing. He's been targeted 29 times over the past three games and scored twice. We can expect New England will try to take away Travis Kelce, meaning that the opportunities could be coming even more often for Rice in Week 15.

WEEK 15 STANDARD RANKINGS:

QBs | RBs | WRs | TEs | D/STs | Kickers

TE Chig Okonkwo, Titans vs. Texans ($5,000). Okonkwo has emerged as a nice weapon for the rookie QB Will Levis, with his target share ticking up as the season has progressed. He turned in 45 and 62 yards, respectively, in Weeks 12 and 13, seeing 11 targets in that span. All that's missing is a touchdown. In a brutal week for main-slate TE matchups, we like Okonkwo to outperform his listed salary against a Texans team that's had its fair share of struggles defending the position recently.

FLEX WR Jayden Reed, Packers vs. Buccaneers ($6,100). The status of Christian Watson (hamstring) will hang over the Packers heading into their game against the Buccaneers. Reed is more than capable of having a big day whether Watson plays or not. The former North Dakota State receiver's presence has capped Reed's ceiling recently, but Tampa's secondary is still having major issues doing its job. Jordan Love appears to have turned a corner, meaning we should expect him to put on a show back at home. Reed will be the primary beneficiary on Sunday.

DEF New York Giants @ Saints ($3,500). There is a lot of bad offense across the NFL this season, and despite signing Derek Carr to make sure they wouldn't be listed among them, the Saints are there anyway. The QB refuses to sit out and deal with the laundry list of injuries ailing him at this point despite them clearly being an issue. Teammates appear fed up with Carr and would seemingly prefer the team return him to the dealership. The Saints are upside-down on this deal right now, with no end in sight. The Giants aren't good, but they have enough defensive pop to contain an offense that keeps spinning its tires most weeks.

Best SuperDraft NFL DFS Picks for Week 15

This year, we're also listing our favorite DFS plays on SuperDraft.

For those unfamiliar, SuperDraft's DFS scoring involves point multipliers as opposed to traditional salary-capped or tiered contests. A winning lineup will likely feature a strong mix of stud fantasy contributors with 1x-1.6x boosts, as well as matchup-based sleepers with larger multipliers. Each player is assigned a scoring multiplier based on their value as determined by SuperDraft. Users can roster any player in their lineup with no restrictions.

sports,Dave Richard,2023-11-30T22:10:58+00:00,"Fantasy Football is all about the matchups. Even though you drafted your team with certain hopes and intentions, your weekly lineup decisions shouldn't be determined by the order you picked your players in. You need to check who your players play and make sure you've got the right guys in -- and the wrong guys out.

It's too early to be absolutely sure on which matchups will be easy and which ones will be tough, but we can take some educated guesses based on healthy personnel, defensive schemes, track records and key details of offenses. The things we know can help us minimize the impact of the things we don't know. This should lead to better decisions being made.

We'll go through every game and highlight the players who aren't obvious starts and sits (because you don't need to be told to start Christian McCaffrey). You should feel more comfortable starting or sitting players based on the information given, and feeling comfortable with your Fantasy lineup before the games start is the best feeling in the world.

It's also important to have a keen eye for matchups dictated by the remaining schedule. I am now updating my projected Strength of Schedule rankings broken down by position available on SportsLine. My objective is to break down how the schedule affects every Fantasy relevant player for the upcoming four weeks, the playoff stretch and the entire season.

Start 'em 10.0-7.00 6.99 - 5.01 5.00 - 0 Sit 'em

Both teams had a week of rest, so don't treat this like a typical Thursday game. But do expect the Cowboys defense to keep the pressure on Geno Smith and a Seattle offense that's struggled to gain consistency over the last month. Smith actually did OK completing passes last week when pressured (60% completion rate) but not at an efficient level (5.4 yards per attempt). Just two QBs have exceeded 250 yards and four QBs have thrown multiple touchdowns against Dallas this year; I don't like Smith's chances to do either, which hurts any upside case for any Seahawks receiver. By the way, Curtis Samuel was the first receiver to get 100 yards on the Cowboys this year, and it took him 12 targets and 9 catches to get there. No one else has had more than 86.

That kind of usage, especially in a game where the Seahawks figure to pass a bunch, makes him a borderline must-start. But on the 12 targets he's seen that have traveled at least 15 Air Yards over the past four weeks, Metcalf has caught just three. More alarming: Five of the targets were knocked away by defenders who were right on him when the ball arrived. He's not really zooming past anyone these days, and he's not winning contested catches regularly either. Pair that with the expectation that he'll line up across from DaRon Bland for much of the game (Bland usually plays right cornerback; Metcalf primarily lines up at left wide receiver) and it could be a rough one. Bland has allowed one touchdown and has allowed just a 52.5% catch rate with 13 passes defensed and seven interceptions. It's the volume you're banking on this week -- I'd start Metcalf in PPR over Diontae Johnson and Cooper Kupp, but I like the upside for Rashee Rice and Courtland Sutton just a little bit more.

He also doesn't see nearly as many deep throws as Metcalf -- literally two targets in his past two games traveled 15 or more Air Yards. Obviously he has potential to always pop off for a big game like he did against a tough Browns defense five weeks ago, but recent matchups against the Niners, Rams and Ravens weren't kind to Lockett. They were even less kind to Geno Smith, and this week shouldn't be much different. Tack on the tough assignment in Stephon Gilmore in coverage (unless the Cowboys use shadow coverage for the first time this year), and Lockett could be in for another lean night. I don't mind him as a WR3 over Drake London, DeAndre Hopkins and Diontae Johnson, but I'd start Rashee Rice and Adam Thielen over Lockett.

The Cowboys are expected to lead this matchup pretty handily, which can squash the upside for a lot of yardage from Ferguson. As for his chances of scoring, 37% of his targets (7 of 19) over the past five weeks have come in the red zone. That's good. But the Seahawks have allowed one touchdown to a tight end all season (David Njoku, Week 8)! Mark Andrews had a great game against Seattle, but even he didn't score. I suspect the Seahawks will have a plan to try and cover Ferguson near the end zone without having to sacrifice too much elsewhere. He's a low-upside play I'd sit for Juwan Johnson, Gerald Everett and Logan Thomas.

Start 'em 10.0-7.00 6.99 - 5.01 5.00 - 0 Sit 'em

Seven straight quarterbacks to face the Broncos have failed to get to 20 Fantasy points, including Josh Allen once and Patrick Mahomes twice! Denver's forced at least one turnover from a quarterback in eight straight games and kept quarterbacks to under 7.0 yards per attempt in five straight. Denver also seems to be playing a lot of heavy zone coverage to deter quarterbacks from throwing deep, mostly Cover-3, and they're also starting to blitz more over the last month than they did before. Stroud's Houdini act has helped him beat most of the defenses he's faced, and this one isn't worthy of being feared, but there is some worry Stroud have a monster game without some massive yards after the catch (YAC) from his receivers. Fortunately he ranks ninth-best on the season among qualifying QBs in YAC per completion (5.37).

He's top five among qualifying quarterbacks in completion rate at 68.3%, he's first in TD rate at 6.3%, he's fourth in off-target rate (7.8%) and he's clearly worked out his issues with his offensive line because he's landed the fourth-longest time-to-throw average (3.14 seconds). And yet he's done this without firing downfield a ton (32nd in passing ADOT at 6.7 yards)! It hasn't translated for Fantasy because Wilson is averaging 29 attempts per game, and it's even lower in his past six games (26). Expect Wilson to throw more in what could become a shootout against the Texans. QBs against Houston are averaging 34.8 pass attempts per game, and the Texans pass rush shouldn't be a problem. I'd count on Wilson to have a 20-plus point game and thus start him over Kyler Murray, Baker Mayfield, Sam Howell and Jordan Love.

Some of that was made up for with receptions, giving him weak yardage totals without a touchdown. Rest assured, Singletary is still clearly Houston's lead back -- he played 81% of their snaps and dominated third downs and snaps inside the 5, even though it appeared Pierce rotated drives with him starting with the third one. The matchup is pretty good as Denver's run defense is the only element that hasn't improved much this season. While it's true that the Broncos have given up just one rushing touchdown in their past six games, it's also true they've let up 5.4 yards per carry in those same six games. Bank on the Texans giving Singletary more work on the ground to pace their offense. I'd start him over Jerome Ford, Javonte Williams and Joe Mixon.

Start 'em 10.0-7.00 6.99 - 5.01 5.00 - 0 Sit 'em

The Patriots have seemingly backed off of being blitz-heavy over their past three games, perhaps because they realized they can get similar payoffs without it (only three of their past nine sacks have come on blitzes). They also have an inflated sack total because they recorded six against the Giants -- they have no more than three in any other game this year including zero against the Colts in Week 10. They haven't stopped playing a lot of man coverage lately, which shouldn't bother Justin Herbert because he's efficient against all coverages (and a little bit better against man-to-man).

The Lions need an answer for their ugly pass defense -- since their Week 9 bye they've been mostly great against the run (3.1 yards per carry allowed, one RB to get 15-plus PPR points) but they rank bottom-six in completion rate allowed (68.4%), yards per attempt allowed (8.0), passing ADOT against (8.84 yards) and defensive Expected Points Added (EPA) per dropback (-0.40, which is league-worst). And of their second-most eight passing touchdowns given up in three games, five have come on passes of 15-plus Air Yards, which is tied for most in the league. They should catch a break with field stretcher Rashid Shaheed (thigh) missing the matchup for New Orleans; Chris Olave looks like he will play. After the injuries to Shaheed and Olave last Sunday it was Alvin Kamara who predictably led the way in targets per routes run (30.8%). Kamara gets a boost both in the pass game and run game with Lions linebacker Alex Anzalone missing action with a hand injury. For the Lions offense, expect the run game to get a bit more focus with Saints linebacker Pete Werner sidelined and All-Pro defensive end Cameron Jordan questionable to play.

The Falcons defense finally had a strong showing against the Saints last week, but they got a little lucky because so many players from New Orleans left with injuries. In the three games prior their defense had a knack for making mediocre offenses look amazing (Will Levis' breakout game, Josh Dobbs' first game with the Vikings, Kyler Murray's first game with the Cardinals). I'm pretty certain they're not bad enough to make Tim Boyle look like Tim Tebow or even Tim Hasselbeck, but I do wonder if they're juuust bad enough to give better-than-normal numbers to Garrett Wilson and Breece Hall. Reinforcements along the O-line should help the Jets' cause against a Falcons defense that's blitzed at a league-average rate, is eighth-lowest in pass rush pressure rate and is fifth-lowest in sacks (28).

Pittsburgh's biggest change in offensive scheme last week involved Kenny Pickett throwing over the middle much more than before (Pat Freiermuth benefitted). But they also ran the ball effectively at Cincinnati -- Najee Harris had one of his best games this year. Expect more of the same against the Cardinals this week. Arizona has allowed five touchdowns to tight ends over its past five games but actually has been relatively efficient defending them otherwise. Can't say the same against the run as the Redbirds rank in the bottom five in pretty much every single run defense metric except yards after contact per rush (where they're league average). A running back has scored 17 or more PPR points in four of their past five against the Cardinals, and eight in 12 games have hit at least 15 PPR points. With Pickett nursing an ankle injury we could see the Steelers run the ball aplenty.

And while Conner has had some red-zone carries in those games with Murray, his O-line hasn't kept him clean, especially near the goal line. Meanwhile Murray has a rushing touchdown in three straight games. Conner will face his former team, one that has held all but four running backs to less than 15 PPR points this year, and the ones who notched 15-plus scored a touchdown. If that doesn't make you feel good about Conner, then you'll especially dislike that he's averaged 0.42 yards before contact on his runs since Murray's return, good for 44th out of 47 running backs (Breece Hall and Derrick Henry had it worse). Pittsburgh's unit held the Bengals and Browns in consecutive weeks to 0.5 yards before contact or less. If you start Conner, don't expect an efficient day and pray to Ye Olde Fantasy Gods for a garbage-time touchdown. I'd rather trust Jaylen Warren, Chuba Hubbard and A.J. Dillon.

Expect plenty of rushing. Losing Jonathan Taylor stings for the Colts but Zack Moss was unreal in his efficiency between Weeks 2 through 5 when Taylor was either out or barely played (5.0 yards per carry is a generic example), and he's only been a little bit worse (4.4 yards per carry) since Taylor took a larger chunk of the workload starting in Week 6. Meanwhile, Derrick Henry was back in a familiar spot of handling plenty of carries against an inferior opponent, scoring twice and tallying 76 rush yards. Anytime he's in a close game or a Titans win, he tends to do well. The Colts rank in the bottom-five in Fantasy points allowed per game this season while the Titans are closer to league-average, but both are in the top-six in RB rush attempts per game against (at least 24.0 each) in their past four games.

With edge rusher Jaelan Phillips, the Dolphins ranked third in sacks (38) and sixth in pass rush pressure rate (39.9%). Both those numbers were boosted by the defense's effort against a sagging Jets offense last Friday. Adding veteran Jason Pierre-Paul isn't a cure-all, but he will help the Dolphins from being forced to blitz a ton week in and week out. The Commanders offensive line has had some ugly showings lately against the Cowboys (four sacks, 49% pass rush pressure rate allowed), the Giants (four sacks, 32.7% pressure rate allowed) and the Seahawks (three sacks, 46.8% pressure rate allowed). Somehow these results are better than what they were allowing through much of the first two months of the year. Sam Howell getting the ball out faster has been a positive in this regard but a negative for his numbers in three of his past four games (the one game he did really well in was sort of fluky). The matchup is a good test for the Dolphins pass rush post-Phillips, one that it should pass without giving up much in the way of deep completions.

When Thomas Brown took over the Panthers playcalling for three games earlier this year, the Panthers averaged a 64% pass rate, Chuba Hubbard dominated touches (two games with 17-plus touches, none with more than 10 PPR points) and Adam Thielen had a large target share (26.5%) with a tiny ADOT (4.33). In the two games since, the Panthers pass rate dipped below 60%, Hubbard shared more regularly and Thielen's ADOT nearly doubled. Hubbard had a good game last week, Thielen hasn't seen monster numbers since before the Week 7 bye. The uncertainty of how the Panthers will operate moving forward with Brown basically calling the offense without any oversight keeps these players are risky Fantasy propositions, though it helps a lot that the Buccaneers are dealing with injuries that hurt their run defense (Lavonte David and Devin White will miss the game) and keep their pass defense from improving (Jamel Dean will miss the game).

Can't help but think that's caused the massive change in his production this year -- that and his quarterback isn't a serial slot-targeter (or a Hall of Famer). Godwin's been under 60 yards in five straight, hasn't had a game with even 10 PPR points since Week 8 and has one touchdown on the year despite being tied for 12th among all NFL players in end-zone targets with nine. It gets worse: The Panthers offense can't score and their run defense is so bad, leaving pass-negative game scripts for their opponents. Just two teams (the Saints and Dolphins) have rostered multiple receivers with 10-plus PPR points against the Panthers in 2023. I'd sit Godwin for Josh Downs, Brandin Cooks, Christian Watson and Curtis Samuel (especially if PPR).

I wouldn't expect the Rams offensive line to handle the Browns' defensive front like they did the Cardinals' last week, but it must be mentioned that the Browns run defense isn't anywhere near as dominant as it was earlier this year. In their past three games, they gave up 4.1 yards per rush to the Ravens (just 6.3% of their runs went 10-plus yards), 7.8 yards per rush to the Steelers thanks to a long TD run by Jaylen Warren (23.8% of their runs went 10-plus yards) and 4.6 yards per rush to the Broncos (18.5% of their runs went 10-plus yards). Playing more snaps because the Browns offense has been inept isn't the reason for it either because they struggled with the run in the first half against all three teams (over 5.3 yards per carry allowed against each). It's silly to say the Rams passing game is struggling when Matthew Stafford just threw four touchdowns, but Cooper Kupp looked like he played hurt last week and Puka Nacua didn't look that much better. If they're ailing, the Rams would be smart to try and use the run game early and often. Expect a low-scoring game.

This is actually a great thing for Cooper; over his past two weeks his ADOT sat at 7.57 yards, which was roughly half of what it was in his first nine games at 15.42 yards. Clearly, the Browns wanted Cooper to run shorter routes and make things easier on rookie QB Dorian Thompson-Robinson. I'd expect that to be out the window now -- Flacco wasn't shy about chucking the rock deep with the Jets, attempting passes of 15-plus Air Yards on 20 percent of his throws, and he had no problem focusing on one primary receiver (Garrett Wilson had 8, 14 and 11 targets in Flacco's starts). The hope is that both Flacco and Cooper are experienced and capable enough to develop rhythm to salvage the Browns passing game. It's the only thing to buy into here as the Rams have allowed the 12th fewest Fantasy points to wide receivers on the season and happen to have done well against deep throws against wide receivers (40% completion rate allowed, two touchdowns, both top six on the season). Cooper's volume should hopefully push him to a decent Fantasy stat line. I'd give him a whirl over Terry McLaurin, Marquise Brown and Diontae Johnson.

That was Kupp, who in Week 12 ran a ton of short routes and couldn't separate and didn't have much sudden movement. If he's going to come through this week it'll likely come on a ton of short targets and/or some targets inside the 10-yard line. The fact that he has 13 total targets in his past three games combined makes it tough to buy into him suddenly getting 10-plus targets this week. The matchup is also a problem -- the Browns have the defensive backs to hang tight with a slower-than-normal Kupp in man-to-man coverage, which they play in a lot. The Browns also have the pass rush to force Matthew Stafford to get the ball out quickly and without much distance. I'm not that nervous to bench Kupp for Rashee Rice, Courtland Sutton and both of the top Seattle WRs.

In three games since getting Chase Young, the Niners have allowed 30 points total, yielded just 3.3 yards per rush to RBs, 5.9 yards per attempt to QBs, pressured quarterbacks at a 43.2% rate (without blitzing much!), accumulated 15 sacks and picked off four interceptions. As many problems as the Eagles present with their offense, the Niners figure to be just as menacing with their collective defense. That will make things tough for the Eagles, whose defense played over 90 snaps last Sunday and could be without a couple of starters in the front seven, and whose offense could be forced into an uncomfortable game script if the Niners build a lead. Even concepts like utilizing Jalen Hurts' mobility on downfield throws and targets to D'Andre Swift are things the Niners have dealt with successfully this season. Not that you'll sit any of your usual Eagles starters in Fantasy, but some might underwhelm given the circumstances. P.S.: They play at Dallas next week.

Jordan Love has posted 20-plus Fantasy points in three straight games, but it's his past two where there's been some real improvement in his play including a low 8.3% off-target rate to go with a 68.1% completion rate and 8.2 yards per attempt. The step-up in competition to the Chiefs will clearly impact him and his offensive line, which played better in their games against the Chargers and Lions. Steve Spagnuolo's defense has been blitzing its tails off over the past two weeks (nearly 50% of their snaps against the Eagles and Raiders), so the hunch is they'll apply maximum pressure to that O-line in an effort to make Love more off-target than he's been and, hopefully, get some turnovers. Only one receiver has had more than 15 PPR points against the Chiefs in their past four games (Jakobi Meyers last week), making it tough to expect grand games from Love's favorite targets. I'd expect shutdown cornerback L'Jarius Sneed to line up across from Christian Watson the most -- and Jayden Reed the least.

Jacksonville's ability to slam on the run, pressure C.J. Stroud (four sacks) and ultimately hold the Texans to 21 points should help you accept their defense as a legit unit. Now they'll take on a Bengals offense that was borderline lucky to even score 10 points last week against the Steelers. Two of Ja'Marr Chase's four receptions were tipped by Steelers first, then the Bengals' longest pass play was on a designed dump-off pass to Joe Mixon for 39 yards. Jake Browning had his moments evading the pass rush but his arm strength is just not very good. Expect the Jaguars to bring plenty of heat to Browning, then lean into Travis Etienne on the ground to bring home a win.","Fantasy Football Week 13 Lineup Decisions: Starts, Sits, Sleepers, Busts to know for every game",https://www.cbssports.com/fantasy/football/news/fantasy-football-week-13-lineup-decisions-starts-sits-sleepers-busts-to-know-for-every-game/,CBSSports.com
sports,Dave Richard,2023-10-04T21:56:25+00:00,"Fantasy Football is all about the matchups. Even though you drafted your team with certain hopes and intentions, your weekly lineup decisions shouldn't be determined by the order you picked your players in. You need to check who your players play and make sure you've got the right guys in -- and the wrong guys out.

It's too early to be absolutely sure on which matchups will be easy and which ones will be tough, but we can take some educated guesses based on healthy personnel, defensive schemes, track records and key details of offenses. The things we know can help us minimize the impact of the things we don't know. This should lead to better decisions being made.

We'll go through every game and highlight the players who aren't obvious starts and sits (because you don't need to be told to start Justin Jefferson). You should feel more comfortable starting or sitting players based on the information given, and feeling comfortable with your Fantasy lineup before the games start is the best feeling in the world.

It's also important to have a keen eye for matchups dictated by the remaining schedule. I am now updating my projected strength of schedule rankings every week over at SportsLine. My objective is to break down how the schedule affects every Fantasy relevant player for the upcoming four weeks, the playoff stretch and the entire season. You'll also be able to find my key takeaways on which players you should buy low, sell high and more trade advice.

Age: 24 • Experience: 3 yrs. Weekly Breakdown MATCHUP @ BUF BUF -5.5 O/U 48.5 OPP VS QB 1st PROJ PTS 15.7 QB RNK 12th YTD Stats PAYDS 943 RUYDS 101 TD 4 INT 2 FPTS/G 16.4 It stings to call Lawrence a dicey Fantasy start because he has potential for greatness, but he's got more upside than all but about 10 quarterbacks this week. Buffalo is savvy when it comes to defending the pass, so I can't say they'll fall off just because star cornerback Tre'Davious White won't play, but I wonder just how effective its pass rush will be without Greg Rousseau and with a sub-100 percent Von Miller (if he plays). Lawrence is a decent starter but I'd rather roll with Anthony Richardson, Jordan Love and Justin Fields.

LAST WEEK: Can't blame drops this time. With his top receiver blanketed thanks to a heavy dose of man coverage, and with a favorable game script, Lawrence didn't have to do too much to help the Jaguars roll past the Falcons. His TD throw off-schedule to Ridley was awesome, but Lawrence set season-lows in pass attempts (30) and throws of 10-plus Air Yards (20% rate). It's worth noting that Week 4 was the first time all year a defense chose to play significant man coverage snaps against the Jaguars.

THIRD DOWNS: Stunningly, Lawrence has completed just 50% of his throws here; only Geno Smith has a worse rate among qualifying quarterbacks. Lawrence is averaging 4.4 yards per attempt with a 6.9-yard Average Depth of Target (ADOT) on the money downs, both ranking bottom-six in the league. Only one pass has been dropped on third down. It's been a drain on his Fantasy production.

PRESSURE: Lawrence is neither getting good pass protection nor thriving while under pressure. Statistically he's a mix of average and bad with his 45.7% completion rate, 6.7 yards per attempt and 14.3% off-target rate when defenders get near him. But the worst number is his EPA per dropback of minus-0.72; only Jimmy Garoppolo, Deshaun Watson and Ryan Tannehill are worse there. That means he's hurting his team more than helping when pressured. And to tie in this point with the prior one, he also happens to be among the least-blitzed quarterbacks on third downs this year.

BILLS: Lost top cornerback Tre'Davious White to a torn Achilles last week which means some combination of Christian Benford, Dane Jackson and Kaiir Elam (who had been benched for the first four games) will work at outside cornerback with Taron Johnson in the slot. That looks good, but the Bills pass rush is among the fiercest in football with a top-10 pass rush pressure rate (38.2%) without blitzing much (15.3% blitz rate is second-lowest in football). Unfortunately, pass rush terror Greg Rousseau won't play for the Bills, lowering their dominance in this area.

The Jaguars have done well against deep-ball receivers but not enough to the point where benching Davis is a good idea. He's toward the top of the flex mix ahead of Tank Dell, Tutu Atwell, Christian Watson and Jerry Jeudy.

LAST WEEK: Kept playing up to his boom/bust ceiling by catching a long touchdown. That's three straight games with a score. It was also his third game out of four with four or fewer targets.

BOOM/BUST INDEED: Davis has a massive ADOT of 16.8 yards (top-10 among 96 receivers with at least 10 targets this season), but he also has a minuscule target share of 13.6% and a target per route run rate of 13.4% (86th out of those 96 receivers). He's clearly a role player with a big-time skill-set that isn't leaned on too much.

JAGUARS: Statistically are top-three in catch rate allowed to wideouts on throws of 15-plus Air Yards (29.4%) with seven passes defensed, but dead-last in yards per catch (43.8!) and YAC/reception (15.0!) on those passes that are completed. They have done a nice job staying close in coverage on those throws.

ZONE COVERAGE: Jacksonville ranks fifth in zone coverage rate (78.5%) and figures to play a lot of it to keep eyes on Josh Allen and deter him from throwing deep. They did the same to Patrick Mahomes in Week 2.

For now he's among the TD-needy running back tier who might only give 13 or 14 PPR points even if he does score (which no one has done against Atlanta). He's more than fine as a bye-week replacement RB (or a RB who you kind of have to start because you're thin at the position) but I'd prefer Breece Hall, Isiah Pacheco and Rhamondre Stevenson over Pierce.

LAST WEEK: Had a touchdown called back on a short designed screen and two more runs from 10 yards or closer get blown up. But at least he began to separate from the other Texans rushers and finish with 24 carries and a catch for over 100 total yards, even if the runs weren't efficient.

FILM: Pierce's vision and burst helped him on plays outside of the tackles and in the screen game. He also did an admirable job fighting for extra yards play after play. Houston's doing a great job utilizing him in spite of its offensive line issues, but those issues do show up frequently anytime he ran between the tackles.

INSIDE/OUTSIDE: In total Pierce had 4.7 yards per run on outside plays with two explosive plays and 2.8 yards per run on inside plays with zero explosives in Week 4. On the season he's been a full yard worse on outside runs and about the same on inside runs, so perhaps he and the Texans are improving on those edge plays.

FALCONS: Have run hot and cold against the run but they've ultimately been good by virtue of their 3.8 rushing average and zero rushing touchdowns allowed to running backs this season. They gave up just three runs of 10-plus yards to RBs in their past three games (all against Jahmyr Gibbs, none to Travis Etienne or A.J. Dillon). They've also held backs to 2.7 yards per carry on edge runs while yielding 4.3 yards on carries between the tackles.

FALCONS: Have not allowed more than 8 non-PPR/11 PPR points to any running back so far this season.

And if the game is low-scoring or a one-sided win for Houston (don't laugh, they just did it last week), it further lowers Dell's ceiling. I'd rather start Romeo Doubs, Christian Watson and Adam Thielen.

LAST WEEK: The Texans didn't need him! Houston built a nice lead thanks to its defense and held on without having to throw the ball a ton.

FILM: The Steelers really emphasized not getting beat deep by Dell, often using a safety over the top to his side of the field to deter C.J. Stroud from even thinking about throwing at him. It worked out for the Steelers because Dell had zero deep targets, and it worked for the Texans because Nico Collins beat soft coverage a bunch including on a 24-yard deep ball (Dell drew triple coverage!) and on his long touchdown score (Dell got a safety to cheat over to his side).

FALCONS: Should be able to deploy the same type of defensive coverage with a safety cheating over to Dell's side of the field. They could also stick outside cornerback A.J. Terrell on Collins and make things a little harder on the Texans. Terrell shadowed a receiver for the first time this season in Week 4, contributing to Calvin Ridley's modest day. It ultimately would mean multiple bodies on Dell.

But it's hard to see the good in his game so far this season beyond him finding holes in zone coverage. Jonnu even has more red-zone targets than Pitts (by one, three to two). The matchup could create some receiving opportunities, so maybe he catches five passes for 50 yards, but that's not anything to be excited about. I'd rather start Jake Ferguson, Zach Ertz and Dallas Goedert.

Sneaky Sleeper (Lineup Decisions) Projections powered by Sportsline Jonnu Smith TE ATL Atlanta • #81

Age: 28 • Experience: 7 yrs. Weekly Breakdown MATCHUP vs HOU ATL -2 O/U 41.5 OPP VS TE 18th PROJ PTS 5.2 TE RNK 24th YTD Stats REC 15 TAR 20 REYDS 179 TD 0 FPTS/G 8.2 I feel like Smith is doing what Pitts is supposed to do: get open and make plays after the catch. The hope is we keep seeing that for Smith, especially if the game is competitive like most Falcons games tend to be. He certainly hasn't done anything to lose his role. I don't mind chancing it with Smith as a streaming tight end, though I just don't have the conviction to start him over Pitts.

LAST WEEK: Was the second time in three weeks where Smith outproduced Pitts, but the first time it was so lopsided. The difference in snaps played and routes run is marginal -- Pitts did more of both -- but Smith is taking advantage of shorter routes with a quarterback who doesn't like to challenge downfield all that much. What's more, Smith averaged more yards per catch not just in Week 4 but also in Week 2, and he was behind Pitts by less than a yard in Week 3 when both had at least eight targets.

FILM ON PITTS: There's no change in his explosiveness whatsoever. He's running at a slower-than-expected pace, but the Jaguars still paid him plenty of attention defensively, creating a double-whammy that left him without many targets. His longest opportunity was a deep ball from Desmond Ridder that was well-placed and perfectly leapt for by Pitts, but he couldn't secure it to the ground, nor was he separated from cornerback Tyson Campbell at all. Pitts was best on shorter routes against zone coverage.

ARTHUR SMITH: Said this week that Pitts isn't at 100%, adding "" there are certain things, you see him, and he's doing really well right now and there are certain things that he can't [do well]. It's been a journey back. He's going to get there.""

FILM ON SMITH: From what I see, Smith is running shorter routes and is getting open faster than Pitts. That's earned him some targets from Ridder, who seemed to have better timing with Smith than Pitts. Smith is not drawing any kind of tight coverage like Pitts either, mostly because he's staying closer to the line of scrimmage. But after the catch Smith has been a handful, breaking three tackles just last week and picking up extra yards with it. He's not fast, but he's faster than Pitts, and for at least last week and Week 2 it changed the calculus for how the Falcons divvied up targets.

TEXANS: Have had a bundle of troubles with tight ends, giving up an 84% catch rate and 6.76 YAC/reception to the position, both bottom-six in the league. That includes allowing an 89% catch rate on 18 total targets to Colts and Jaguars' tight ends in Weeks 2 and 3 for 9.9 yards per catch and 7.2 YAC/reception. These numbers were a byproduct of the amount of zone coverage they played against both teams, leaving the short middle of the field open. Houston has played the third-most zone coverage of any team this year and should do so again.

Flex Starter in PPR (Lineup Decisions) Projections powered by Sportsline Zay Flowers WR BAL Baltimore • #4

Age: 23 • Experience: Rookie We've come to love (or hate) Ravens-Steelers games for their tough defense and low-scoring battles. That might hurt Flowers' chances of scoring -- it will probably take a little luck, which isn't necessarily too big of an ask given how the Steelers secondary has played recently. If you start Flowers, you're counting on the Steelers run defense staying strong and the Ravens using Flowers to create solid plays as a run-game extension and/or you're hoping for a splash play. That makes him a risky flex with a much safer floor in PPR than half- or non-PPR. In the catch-counting formats I'll start him over Tank Dell, the Broncos WRs, Jordan Addison and George Pickens.

FLOWERS: Has seen his target share increase in competitive Ravens games (not like Week 4's blowout win) and especially when the Ravens run game isn't overly efficient (Weeks 1 and 3). Of his 29 targets, 18 have been on throws of 3 or fewer Air Yards and half of those have been WR screens.

STEELERS: Run defense has improved considerably over their past two games, giving up just 3.5 yards per tote and 2.22 yards after contact per run against the Raiders and Texans. That could open up more targets for Flowers.

STEELERS: Haven't seen many WR screens but the ones they've defended have yielded a pathetic 13.75 YAC/reception. This is an exploitable play for Flowers.

DEEP BALL: The Steelers haven't been so hot here either, allowing 16 of 33 targets of 15-plus Air Yards to be completed for 22.5 yards per catch and for three touchdowns. This is an exploitable play for Flowers, who has caught 4 of 5 deep passes for a sizzling 136 yards.

HISTORY: In five career games against Pittsburgh, Lamar Jackson has thrown four career touchdowns. At least all of them went to his wideouts. All were in the red zone, none were on deep throws and none were on WR screens.

The Ravens have been pretty good against the run but they can give up some numbers. Harris is a volume-based back who is at best a low-end starting option given everything that's going on. I'd rather start Breece Hall, Rhamondre Stevenson, Dameon Pierce and Jaleel McLaughlin (if Javonte Williams sits out).

LAST WEEK: Harris had his first game with over 100 total yards against the Texans and averaged 5.1 yards per rush, just shy of the season-high he technically had on six carries against the 49ers in Week 1. A 32-yard reception helped him cross the triple-digit barrier.

HARRIS: This might shock you, but Harris is averaging 4.3 yards per run this year with a 12.2% explosive run rate. Would you believe the explosive run rate, which reflects the frequency of his 12-plus-yard runs, is fifth-best among 44 qualifying running backs?! He's also 13th in avoided tackle rate and top-10 in yards after contact per carry at 3.53.

TOUCHDOWNS: Harris has zero. Somehow it gets worse: He has one carry inside the 15-yard line. The Steelers have run the second-fewest red-zone plays (18, one more than New England) and second-fewest plays inside the 5-yard line (two, one more than New England). The Steelers have played four games! This is nuts.

RAVENS: Have yet to allow a rushing score to a running back this year. They've been otherwise solid against RBs, holding them to 4.0 yards per carry on the season and roughly league-average in other metrics including missed tackles (15). But just three players have averaged over 4.0 yards per carry: Joe Mixon (4.5 yards per run, didn't have 100 total yards, didn't score), Zack Moss (4.1 yards per run, ran for 122 yards on 30 carries and caught a touchdown) and Pierre Strong (9.8 yards per carry, most of it coming in garbage time last week).

HISTORY: Harris had over 120 total yards and a touchdown in a Week 17 win in Baltimore last year. He also scored on them with exactly 50 total yards against them in at home in Week 14. He has posted at least 10 non-PPR points in 3 of 4 career games.

I definitely buy into the Lions run defense to keep Sanders grounded, and his playing time seems to be slipping away. I'd rather start Jahmyr Gibbs, Dameon Pierce and Najee Harris.

LAST WEEK: His playing time hit a season-low 43% of the snaps as he continued losing third-down work to Chuba Hubbard. It hasn't crushed his reception totals at all but it's notable that his only game with more than four grabs came with Andy Dalton under center. Sanders also played just 31% of the Panthers' second-half snaps, a big-time change after his second-half snaps were a lot closer to Hubbard's in Weeks 2 and 3.

SANDERS: His yards per carry has tumbled like a bowling ball downstairs this season, going from 4.0 against the Falcons to 3.1 against the Saints to 2.7 against the Seahawks to 1.5 against the Vikings. Tough matchups? Sure, even including the Vikings. Doesn't mean it's not a good look.

NOT SURPRISINGLY: Sanders has two runs of 12-plus yards through four games -- and neither went more than 15 yards. It's not all on him -- the offensive line for the Panthers barely gave him any daylight last week (and for much of the year) and defenses aren't yet scared of getting beat by Bryce Young's arm.

LIONS: Are a tough matchup, giving up 2.9 yards per rush to running backs on the season. That ranks top-three, as does their yards before contact allowed (0.49) and runs of 10-plus yards allowed (three). Forgive them for the 2.38 yards after contact per rush allowed -- that's only fifth-best in the league. Only Kenneth Walker, on the strength of two touchdowns, has had more than five non-PPR and nine PPR points against these Lions.

LAST YEAR: Detroit was pretty strong against the run last year when they went into Carolina and got absolutely pummeled by the Panthers run game (which included Chuba Hubbard). Coach Dan Campbell knows it -- he accepted responsibility for that loss last year claiming the Lions ""were not emotionally ready to go."" They should be this time around. Besides, it's a different coaching staff in Carolina and, clearly, a different run game.

There will be temptation on his part to test Jameson Williams on deep throws, and no doubt there will be opportunities for Sam LaPorta and Josh Reynolds (and Jahmyr Gibbs, hopefully), but it's more likely Goff has a modest game at home with a couple of scores and maybe 225 yards. I'll give him the nod over Dak Prescott and Joe Burrow, but Jordan Love, Trevor Lawrence, Josh Dobbs and C.J. Stroud all have more potential to help you win.

LAST WEEK: After an interception, Goff marched downfield and got the Lions a touchdown, then gave way to David Montgomery to pound the Packers into submission. He had his lowest number of pass attempts (28) and yards (210) this year, and threw just one touchdown for the third time in four games.

PANTHERS: At 27.9% are dead last in pass rush pressure rate through four weeks. The only game this season when they had some pressure on a quarterback was against the Seahawks, who have a beat-up offensive line. The Lions offensive line is near full strength and have allowed Goff to be sacked five times through four games.

QUARTERBACKS: Have failed to top 20 Fantasy points against the Panthers this season. That includes Kirk Cousins last week, who only threw 19 times in a win (and had two touchdowns but just 13 Fantasy points). Only twice has a quarterback thrown more than TWENTY passes against Carolina.

RUNNING BACKS: Have clobbered the Panthers. For the first three weeks of the year a rusher had at least two touchdowns against the Panthers. Last week no Vikings running back did, but Alexander Mattison (5.6) and Cam Akers (8.0) each had uncharacteristically high rushing averages. Keep in mind: The Vikings have basically operated like they are allergic to running the ball UNTIL they played the Panthers.

GOFF: Played one game last year without Amon-Ra St. Brown. He completed 26 of 39 passes for 378 yards and four touchdowns with an interceptions in a mad come-from-behind effort against the Seahawks, who won the game 48-45. It's unlikely the Panthers will force the issue on the scoreboard like the Seahawks did last season.

He's still a decent start ahead of Najee Harris, Khalil Herbert and Jahmyr Gibbs but I'd rather chance my lineup with someone who has upside like Jaleel McLaughlin (if Javonte Williams sits out) or Alexander Mattison.

FILM: The numbers don't quite match the talent -- Stevenson is a capable runner with great vision, balance and power to go with good speed. He struggled on lateral runs last week and his line failed him plenty on north-south runs. Game script kept him from finding a lot of work last week (one fourth-quarter touch).

THIS SEASON: Stevenson has at least 16 touches in every game, which is good. Unfortunately he has yet to total 100 yards and has been under 70 yards three times, which is definitely the opposite of good.

STEVENSON: The Patriots front five has gone through all kinds of issues and as a result have contributed to Stevenson averaging 0.98 yards before contact per rush this season. That ranks 29th out of 44 qualifying running backs. And if you think that's bad then consider his yards after contact per rush average of 1.75, which is dead-last among those same 44 qualifiers.

EXPLOSIVE RUNS: Stevenson has one (1) explosive carry of 12 or more yards. It was against Miami. It went 12 yards. This is a big change from 2022 when he had 21 explosive runs and an explosive run rate of 10%, which was eighth-best.

RECEIVING: Is averaging 4.0 targets per game and catching 75% of them but is getting just 7.3 yards per catch and has one (1) explosive catch of 16 or more yards. That one went for 32 yards against the Eagles in Week 1. Since then his longest reception has been for seven yards.

SAINTS: Are sixth-best in rushing average to RBs (3.6) and are top-10 in basically every single run defense metric you could think of, including missed tackles with just nine on the year. The only rusher to exceed 10 Fantasy points against them, PPR or not, was Derrick Henry in Week 1. He had 13 PPR points. No one's run for a touchdown on them either.

SAINTS: Aren't quite as impressive against running backs through the air, but they're not awful. Figure them as league average across the board except in YAC/reception (8.53), but that was due to a massive catch-and-run by Henry in Week 1. Since Week 2 their YAC/reception has been 5.94, sixth best in that span with zero explosive pass plays allowed to RBs. So they're pretty good.

Weekly Breakdown MATCHUP vs NYG MIA -11 O/U 48.5 OPP VS RB 23rd PROJ PTS 16 RB RNK 17th YTD Stats RUYDS 249 REC 13 REYDS 115 TD 7 FPTS/G 22.4 If you're starting Mostert, you're hoping he hasn't fumbled away his half of the touches he's had over the past two weeks AND can have the chance at scoring. Miami is capable of giving Mostert more short-yardage work out of the blue, but their actions over the past two weeks suggest Achane is their preferred back near the goal line. Understand the risks in starting Mostert as a No. 2 RB, who could be dog-house bound with another fumble. He's behind Isiah Pacheco and Breece Hall in my rankings but ahead of Jahmyr Gibbs, Dameon Pierce and Najee Harris. Achane is clearly far ahead of Mostert.

LAST WEEK: Before he fumbled the ball away twice, Mostert was splitting reps with De'Von Achane in a way that was unfavorable for him. Before the Dolphins got inside the 10-yard line Mostert had a 16-to-9 edge, then Achane played every single snap inside the 10. Then after Mostert's second fumble of the half, Mostert played just nine of the remaining 35 snaps including nothing near the end zone. Coach Mike McDaniel preached the importance of his offense not having ""self-inflicted wounds"" immediately after the game.

LAST TWO WEEKS: Achane played all but two snaps inside the 10-yard line for Miami, so that seems like a big part of his role that will stick. As for third downs, Mostert has a one-snap edge over Achane at 6 to 5, which means they're splitting those valuable touches. Overall the targets have favored Mostert only because he had more of them in Week 3 against Denver (7 to 4).

GIANTS: Are about to get run over. Their 4.3-yard rushing average they've allowed is a shade worse than league average but they rate poorly in rushing touchdowns allowed (five), rushes of 10-plus yards allowed (14) and missed tackles on runs (24, fourth-worst in football).

DOLPHINS: Have split the workload pretty evenly despite the snap shares morphing in Achane's favor. Last week Achane had 11 touches to Mostert's 10. The week before Achane had 22 to Mostert's 20. The week before that ... Achane wasn't a thing and Mostert had 19 touches to Salvon Ahmed's six (Achane had none). At least we can say over the past two weeks that the Dolphins have used both backs rather evenly in touches, even though WHERE they've gotten them haven't been as equal.

I think he'll continue to see high-value targets near the end zone and, hopefully, a small uptick in targets. I'd start him as a No. 2 receiver over Terry McLaurin, any Broncos wideouts and any Packers wideouts.

LAST WEEK: Was so close to having a monster game. He was the designed target on a trick play and saw the ball fall just past his outstretched hands in the end zone. He also had two targets inside the 10-yard line (his first two of the season) and two end-zone targets including the aforementioned trick play (his first two of the season). The heavy dose of targets inside the 10 and into the end zone are positive signs that the Titans are trying to get him going as a playmaker.

FILM: Hopkins might be 31 years old but he moved really, really well, creating separation with outstanding footwork and having just enough speed to stay a step ahead of defenders. He got open on a handful of third-down plays when he didn't get a target last week.

TANNEHILL: Is the top problem Hopkins has right now. Hopkins' 38-yard deep-ball catch last week could have been as many as 50 yards if Tannehill hit him in stride, and the gimmick-play touchdown would have obviously been a massive point-getter had Tannehill been slightly more on-target there. There was even a target into the end zone that was a miscommunication between Hopkins and Tannehill. On the season Tannehill has a 13% off-target rate but over the past two games that number has ballooned to 18%, which is ... yikes.

TITANS: The second problem Hopkins has right now is a Titans offense that's stayed true to their run-first preference -- at least when they win. On the year they're throwing the ball 54.6% of the time, 10th-lowest, but in their wins they've thrown the ball 46.4% of their snaps. In losses they've thrown 64.4% of the time. The Colts are one-point home favorites, which means at minimum the game should be competitive, which does not help the pass-run ratio outlook.

COLTS: Are a frozen yogurt sundae of a dream matchup for Hopkins. On the season outside receivers like Hopkins have caught 72.3% of their targets for 12.7 yards per catch against the Colts. The catch rate is bottom six, the yardage rate is top-12, but the Colts defense leads the NFL in missed tackles on passing plays with 10. Indianapolis also lost their top outside corner, Dallis Flowers, to a torn Achilles. They'll roll with rookies JuJu Brents (80% catch rate allowed) and Jaylon Jones (played two snaps this season) along with already-benched second-year corner Darrell Baker (TD allowed in each of first two games) as outside cornerbacks.

PASS RUSH: Rank fifth-worst in pass-rush pressure rate and seventh-worst in blitz rate AND might be without edge rusher Kwity Paye. The Titans are helped by the return of rookie guard Peter Skoronski and tackle Nicholas Petit-Frere. Tannehill could have more time to throw accurately.

Or Denver. Or Chicago. You get the gist. The Cardinals pass rush shouldn't be too dangerous and Burrow, now over a month into his season, figures to eventually show some signs of improvement with his health. In no way is he a must start, and there's plenty of good reason to go with Trevor Lawrence, Russell Wilson, C.J. Stroud and even Joshua Dobbs over him, but there's some mild appeal that should at least keep him in lineups over Dak Prescott and Daniel Jones.

LAST WEEK: Looked like a quarterback playing on one leg. Burrow didn't get much into his throws, didn't challenge downfield much, got the ball out as fast as he could and was sensitive to pass rush pressure. Even when the game was in garbage time Burrow couldn't get much going.

AIR YARDS LAST WEEK: Burrow was 1 for 4 on throws of 10-plus Air Yards and 0 for 2 on throws of 15-plus Air Yards.

AIR YARDS THIS SEASON: Burrow has been 11 for 38 on throws of 10-plus Air Yards and 2 for 22 on throws of 15-plus Air Yards.

TOUCHDOWNS: Burrow has thrown just two scores this season. Both came against Baltimore in Week 2, both were throws inside the five-yard line, both were to Tee Higgins. That's it. Even his red-zone stats are unfathomable -- he's completed 7 of 15 passes in the red zone. At least 9 of those 15 throws went into the end zone.

PASS RUSH: Bengals opponents have started to sniff out Burrow's issues and have come after him. The Browns and Titans had a pass rush pressure rate between 38& and 42% in their wins over Cincy with high blitz rates (at least 31% each). Compare that to the Rams and Ravens, who barely brought pressure or blitzes and either lost or nearly lost to the Bengals.

CARDINALS: Are dead-last in blitz rate this season (14%) and third-to-worst in pass rush pressure rate (28%). They actually had nine sacks after Weeks 1 and 2 but have had three since against the Cowboys and 49ers. Arizona seems to prefer using just four rushers to affect the quarterback, something that should be helpful to Burrow this week.

CARDINALS: Rank eighth-worst in completion rate allowed (69.8%, though that was boosted heavily by Brock Purdy's 95% completion rate last week), and are bottom-five in both yards per catch (11.7) and missed tackles on pass plays (49!).

Weekly Breakdown MATCHUP @ LAR PHI -4.5 O/U 50.5 OPP VS TE 23rd PROJ PTS 9.3 TE RNK 12th YTD Stats REC 13 TAR 19 REYDS 88 TD 0 FPTS/G 5.5 Goedert is a distant third in targets on the Eagles for a reason -- he's not explosive in the least and the Philly offense is much more concerned with its explosive components. It shouldn't be lost on Fantasy managers that since Swift became a staple in the Eagles offense, Goedert has taken a backseat. There's always still a shot he scores from short range, but you know how the Eagles like to run the ball when they're near the goal line. I'd rather start Jake Ferguson and Zach Ertz in all formats as well as Kyle Pitts and Cole Kmet in non-PPR.

THREE WEEKS IN A ROW: With seven or fewer targets, Goedert has failed to get even 50 yards receiving. His target volume dipped from seven in Weeks 2 and 3 to four in Week 4. Goedert had the same amount of targets as D'Andre Swift.

NICK SIRIANNI: The Eagles coach again said ""[w]e need to get him the football,"" citing that plays designed for him wound up going to other Eagles because of how defenses played Goedert.

FILM: If there's something teams are doing to take away Goedert, I didn't see it on any of his nine third-down routes last week. Goedert still looked sluggish in his movements and didn't run a ton of deeper routes, though there were a couple where he did get open but Jalen Hurts had better opportunities elsewhere.

LAST WEEK: On the plus side, two of his targets were in the red zone and a third was a deep contested catch for 17 yards. On the downside, he dropped that fourth target on a short throw.

GOEDERT: Has three red-zone targets and zero end-zone targets this season.

RAMS: Got stung for two touchdowns to tight ends at Indy last week, one on a 35-yard play where Mo Alie-Cox got matched up with DE-turned-OLB Mike Hoecht. The other was a five-yard toss to Andrew Ogletree, who ran past Hoecht off the snap for an easy touchdown grab. These guys aren't considered primary tight ends like Goedert, though, so it's unlikely the Rams would cover Goedert the same way as they covered them (which is to say, they barely did).

BEFORE WEEK 4: The Seahawks, Bengals and 49ers tight ends, including George Kittle, combined for eight non-PPR/19 PPR Fantasy points over three games against the Rams. L.A.'s pass stats against tight ends were much better before the Colts laid some numbers on them.

He's a flex at best who I'd sit for Romeo Doubs, Gabe Davis and Christian Watson.

LAST WEEK: Total disaster. In a gamescript that actually gave Minnesota a chance to -- gasp! -- run the ball, Kirk Cousins barely threw the ball and Addison went catchless on one target. There was also a major reduction in snaps played, down to 58%. His season-low was 56% from Week 1.

MATCHUP: With the Vikings capable of running the ball, the offense went with heavier formations. Backup tight end Josh Oliver played about as many snaps as he did in Week 1 and third tight end Johnny Mundt saw a season-high 17% of snaps. Week 4 was the first time all year the Vikings DIDN'T throw the ball on at least 69% of their snaps.

THIRD MAN: Last week did affirm that Addison may actually be the No. 3 wide receiver in the offense behind Justin Jefferson and K.J. Osborn, but even with the donut Addison still has a five-catch lead on Osborn on the season with 68 more yards gained.

THIS WEEK: You can bank on the Vikings reversing course against the Chiefs. Two of the past three offenses against Kansas City wound up throwing at least 71% of their snaps. The team that didn't? Chicago, who was so badly blown out by halftime that they ran the ball 55% of their second-half snaps just to get out of Arrowhead.

CHIEFS: Have been stout against receivers all season long, ranking top-five in catch rate allowed (53.4%) and YAC/reception allowed (2.96), and sixth-best in yards per catch given up (11.1). Even if you take out the Bears game the Chiefs have yielded a 56.8% catch rate and 2.93 YAC/reception with a 10.9 receiving average to the Lions, Jaguars and Jets. Drill down even further and they're great against outside receivers like Addison in terms of catch rate (45.8%) and YAC/reception (2.86), but they have allowed 15.0 yards per catch specifically to outside receivers. It's the only saving grace Addison has.

Start Him (Lineup Decisions) Projections powered by Sportsline Garrett Wilson WR NYJ N.Y. Jets • #17

Age: 23 • Experience: 2 yrs. Weekly Breakdown MATCHUP @ DEN DEN -1.5 O/U 43 OPP VS WR 24th PROJ PTS 13.5 WR RNK 15th YTD Stats REC 21 TAR 36 REYDS 225 TD 2 FPTS/G 13.9 Is the matchup so easy that Zach Wilson will have tons of time in the pocket to make perfect throws? That's tough to bank on simply because Wilson has rarely thrown the ball with precision. But I like Garrett Wilson's chances of seeing a lot of targets and coming through with at least a couple of big plays against a defense that has been tied in knots for the past eight quarters. I'd start Wilson over Gabe Davis, Jakobi Meyers and any Broncos wideouts.

LAST WEEK: A breakout of sorts as Wilson caught 9 of 14 targets to boost his PPR score, but he ultimately wound up with 60 receiving yards, his second-highest amount of the season. Wilson was real close to cashing in a 29-yard touchdown but Zach Wilson was off-target with the throw.

ZACH WILSON: Of the 36 targets Garrett Wilson has seen from Zach Wilson, 11 of them (31%) have been uncatchable. That doesn't include another three incompletions that were either thrown late or predetermined that defenses were able to sniff out.

SILVER LINING? Garrett Wilson is clearly the alpha of the passing game, collecting at least twice as many targets this season than anyone else on the Jets.

THE REAL SILVER LINING: The Jets will take on a Broncos defense that has been awful to watch. No defense has allowed a higher catch rate (85.1%) or scored a worse Defensive EPA per drop back (minus-0.79) collectively to wide receivers than the Broncos. And after yielding an 86.7% catch rate ad 20.8 yards per catch to the Dolphins in Week 3, Denver turned around and let up a 92.9% catch rate and 15.6 yards per catch to the Bears in Week 4! Even top cornerback Pat Surtain has allowed a high-for-him 63% completion rate this season. Surtain allowed four catches for 56 yards over six targets in his coverage last week. It does not help that Denver's pass rush has been practically non-existent.

Sit Him (Lineup Decisions) Projections powered by Sportsline Russell Wilson QB DEN Denver • #3

Age: 35 • Experience: 12 yrs. I chose to drop Wilson in my rankings because this should be one of his toughest matchups of the season, and his reliance on outside receivers and the deep ball are at risk given this matchup. We might see a much more subdued and boring version of Wilson's game, which means he could very well wind up with a stat line like Mahomes had against the Jets last week. I'd rather start Jared Goff, Trevor Lawrence, Joshua Dobbs and C.J. Stroud.

LAST WEEK: Was the second time in three games Wilson had 28-plus Fantasy points. It helped that he played a bad Bears defense with a beat-up secondary. His other high-score game? Week 2 against the Commanders, where he had 92 yards and a Hail Mary touchdown in the final 0:48 to boost his score an extra 9.7 Fantasy points (he still had 22.2 points without it).

THE JETS: Have given up over 16 Fantasy points to a quarterback ONCE all season -- Dak Prescott in Week 2. The other three they faced, including Josh Allen in Week 1 and Patrick Mahomes last Sunday, were under 16 Fantasy points.

PASS RUSH: The Jets tend to get to the quarterback without blitzing (19.5% blitz rate is bottom-five), getting some pressure on 41.6% of their snaps so far this year, which is third-best in the league. And it's been consistent -- their only ""low"" game was at Dallas and they still bugged Prescott 32.5% of the time. That's a lot.

O-LINE: Denver's front five allows the sixth-highest pass rush pressure rate this year at 39.5%. The Bears had pressure on 32.3% of their dropbacks against Denver last week, their second-highest of the season (they did blitz a bunch).

WILSON: His numbers when pressured don't look bad over the course of the season, but they're weighted by his numbers against the Raiders in Week 1. In his past three games when he threw a lot against Washington, Miami and Chicago, Wilson completed 56.4% of his passes when pressured for 8.0 yards per attempt with a better-than-most 5.1% TD rate and a great off-target rate of 2.6%. Of those numbers, only his off-target rate is somehow better when pressured than not pressured; the rest are all much better when he has time. He shouldn't have much time this week.

DEEP BALL: The Jets are also pretty good versus throws of 15-plus Air Yards, giving up just a 40.7% completion rate with four interceptions and an in-context low number of 23.1 yards per grab (seventh-best). Wilson ranks top-10 among quarterbacks in completion rate (50%) and yards per attempt (17.2) with the second-lowest off-target rate (12.5%) on those long throws but is below league-average in overall attempts. His numbers are also inflated because of that Commanders game and the Hail Mary he hit on.

VS. OUTSIDE WRs: The Jets allow the second-highest catch rate to perimeter guys (79.4%), but they're top-five in yards per catch (10.7), ADOT (10.38) and completions allowed of 20-plus yards (three, which is best in NFL). Outside guys have also seen the third-fewest targets because teams know not to attack there.

WILSON: 50 of his 132 passes (38%) have gone to outside receivers this year. Seven of his nine touchdowns have headed that way too. This is a problem for Wilson.

Start Him (Lineup Decisions) Projections powered by Sportsline Jake Ferguson TE DAL Dallas • #87

Age: 24 • Experience: 2 yrs. The only reason to give Ferguson the nod is because he's a safety valve for Prescott to lean on. It's a volume play where you're counting on Ferguson to catch six or seven balls and average around 10 yards per catch. It makes him much more appealing in PPR than non-PPR, which is why I'm OK starting him over Dallas Goedert and Kyle Pitts.

LAST WEEK: Was the benefactor of Dak Prescott taking what the Patriots defense gave him, mostly utilizing Ferguson as a short-area target to fire the ball to when the pressure was quick off the snap. But there were a couple of throws where Prescott read the defense well and found Ferguson for pretty good gains. All told Ferguson led the Cowboys with seven targets and seven catches for 77 yards in three quarters of work.

THIS WEEK: The 49ers figure to unleash its pass rush on Prescott with zone coverage behind it, which only makes sense given how Prescott has handled the pass rush pressure this year. It should mean more short throws for Ferguson.

49ERS: Are tops in football in catch rate allowed to tight ends (48.6%) and YAC/reception allowed (1.29 yards). They're also top-five in yards per catch (7.1). These numbers are even more amazing when you realize tight ends have averaged 8.8 targets per game against the Niners this season, third-most in football. Tyler Higbee and Darren Waller were completely humbled, but Zach Ertz had 11 PPR points last week and nearly caught a touchdown. Pat Freiermuth did catch a touchdown in Week 1 to earn him seven PPR points.

Sit Him (Lineup Decisions) Projections powered by Sportsline Brock Purdy QB SF San Francisco • #13

Age: 24 • Experience: 2 yrs. It's safe to expect Purdy to feel a lot of pressure against the Cowboys, and throwing in man coverage behind it could create some havoc that could speed up Purdy. He's been so consistent and the 49ers are so loaded, but this is just one of those rare matchups where there's too much downside to buy into Purdy. After ranking him high early in the week I've moved him behind Anthony Richardson, Jordan Love and Trevor Lawrence, but still ahead of Joe Burrow, Dak Prescott and Daniel Jones.

LAST WEEK: Purdy's been a find ever since the 49ers put him on the field but last week he executed their offense flawlessly. Seriously -- he missed on one throw. And for the second time this season, Purdy threw a pass that was ruled a lateral for a touchdown, robbing his Fantasy managers of precious points. Of course, it helped that he played Arizona, a defense that has taken a step back in pressuring quarterbacks.

PURDY: Has hit at least 20 Fantasy points in 8 of his 9 regular-season starts, and it really should be 9 for 9 because of that first touchdown that was ruled a lateral back in Week 2. If you include the two playoff games he completed, Purdy has delivered at least 20 in 9 of 11 games. And in 5 of those 9 he hit at least 23 Fantasy points including each of his past two games.

COWBOYS: Dallas' defense lost top cornerback Trevon Diggs and they're still red hot. They lead the league in pass rush pressure rate this season (55.6%) and they're in the top-10 in blitz rate (31.9%). It's that pressure that's helped the Cowboys rank in the top-five in completion rate allowed (57.4%), passing touchdowns allowed (two) and missed tackles on pass plays (just five, that's best in football). Only Joshua Dobbs, who ran for 55 yards, has scored double-digit Fantasy points against the Niners (18 points). Not that the Cowboys have been tested much -- Daniel Jones, Zach Wilson and the Patriots QBs are the other guys they've man-handled.

O-LINE: San Francisco has allowed a pass rush pressure on 36.4% of their snaps, which sounds like a lot but it's just a shade worse than league average. That number is weighted by the Giants' decision to blitz on 84.6% of Purdy's dropbacks in Week 2, creating an inflated pass rush pressure rate. Despite the Giants' efforts, Purdy still threw for 310 yards and two touchdowns in a game he didn't have Brandon Aiyuk in.

COWBOYS: Have become one of the most aggressive defenses in the league, ranking third from the bottom in zone coverage snaps. And truthfully, the only quarters they've actually played heavy zone have been at the end of blowout wins over the Giants and Jets. If they keep that up they'd look completely different than in their playoff meeting against Purdy in January when they played heavy zone for nearly 86% of their snaps.

PURDY: Has been sensational against both man and zone coverages this season. His completion rate and yards per attempt are noticeably higher against zone, but four of his five passing touchdowns have come versus man coverage. However, Purdy's been at his worst when pressured (like most quarterbacks), completing 48.6% of his throws for 5.6 yards per attempt with a gaudy 18.9% off-target rate.

LAST YEAR IN THE PLAYOFFS: The Cowboys pressured Purdy on 48.5% of his drop backs despite blitzing just 21.2% of the time. Purdy completed 65% of his throws but struggled mightily with 214 yards passing and no touchdowns.

Start Him (Lineup Decisions) Projections powered by Sportsline Jordan Love QB GB Green Bay • #10

Age: 25 • Experience: 4 yrs. The Raiders' track record against QBs and Love getting Aaron Jones and Christian Watson back without snap limits are what provides the most optimism here. The return of guard Elgton Jenkins helps, too. Love has upside to get back to 25-plus Fantasy points like he had in Weeks 1-3. I'd start him over Trevor Lawrence, Joe Burrow and Jared Goff.

LAST WEEK: Obviously the Lions pass rush was too much for him and the Packers offensive line in the first half. Motown especially played a lot of zone coverage early and Love still threw into the teeth of it. He calmed down in the second half and took more of what the Lions gave him and really got into a groove before making a bad read on a miscommunication with Romeo Doubs for his second interception.

A POSITIVE? Despite the turmoil last week, Love had season-bests in completion rate (63.9%) and off-target throws (11.1%) while still averaging a hefty 9.5 ADOT, which was his second-lowest on the year but still above league average.

FILM: I remember pointing out in the preseason that Love was late on a few of throws. That was the case in Week 4, but the bigger issue was passes sailing high on him because he was putting too much of his body into his throws. Combine those things with his penchant for attacking deep and it's no wonder he had a bad game. But there's something else -- Love was pass rush ignorant, meaning he didn't let the Lions' pressure scare him, even if it did wind up overwhelming him for some early-game sacks.

RAIDERS: Deserve credit for trying -- in the past two weeks they lead the NFL in pass rush pressure rate and are 10th in blitz rate. Playing weaker offensive lines in Pittsburgh and L.A. have helped boost those numbers, but quarterbacks are still finding success to the tune of 13.9 yards per catch and 7.07 YAC/reception over those two games, both bottom-three in the league. And, both quarterbacks the Raiders played in Weeks 3 and 4 each posted at least 22 Fantasy points (Kenny Pickett, Justin Herbert without his second-best receiver and without his top running back).

RAIDERS: The hunch is the Raiders will keep bringing the blitz and play a lot of gutsy man coverage behind it. They've been playing more man coverage in two of their past three games and have really only moved to heavy zone against the Broncos in Week 1.

LOVE: Has been a mixed bag against man coverage -- his completion rate has been terrible at 39.4%, but his touchdown rate has been outstanding (12.1%). Plus more man coverage and more blitzing could result in more rushing for Love, which he's shown he's willing to do.

Bust Candidate (Lineup Decisions) Projections powered by Sportsline Justin Fields QB CHI Chicago • #1

Age: 24 • Experience: 3 yrs. Weekly Breakdown MATCHUP @ WAS WAS -6 O/U 44.5 OPP VS QB 23rd PROJ PTS 17.3 QB RNK 10th YTD Stats PAYDS 861 RUYDS 134 TD 8 INT 5 FPTS/G 20.4 This isn't that big of a step-up in competition for Fields, but it is for his offensive line. The deep-ball opportunities are a huge plus if Fields has good protection like he had last week. But if the short-week preparation doesn't scare you a little, his lack of rushing should since we're effectively starting him only for his passing chops. I'm not sure I'm comfortable with that. Anthony Richardson and Jordan Love have more potential than Fields this week, but guys like Russell Wilson, Trevor Lawrence, Dak Prescott and Jared Goff don't. You just might not have a better option than Fields.

LAST WEEK: Posted his first-ever game with four passing touchdowns and over 300 yards against a Broncos defense that was devoid of a serious pass rush or pass coverage skills through the first three quarters. By the fourth quarter the Broncos were generating heavy pressure and Fields finished 5 of 11 for 50 yards and no touchdowns with two turnovers.

FILM: For three quarters Fields looked terrific firing downfield from clean pockets with plenty of great reads and accurate throws along with a play or two where he manipulated defenders with the threat of him running only to throw over their heads, including on Kmet's short touchdown. His off-target rate was literally 0.0%. But by the fourth only some plays were fine -- on others he either was pressured, threw off his back foot, threw with too much velocity or wasn't on the same page as his target. His off-target rate in the fourth was 9.1%, which was closer to what he had averaged in his first three games (13.6%).

BRONCOS: Have allowed season-best Fantasy numbers to each of the past three quarterbacks they've played this season. They're a terrific matchup for anybody right now. Remember this when we talk about the Jets.

COMMANDERS: Sport a slightly below-average pass rush pressure rate thanks to only one game all year with a rate over 30% (52.7% at Denver, and Wilson still had a great game even if you take away a Hail Mary touchdown catch). They rank seventh in sacks (13) and 13h in pressures (53), which again floats around league average.

BEARS: Rank league-worst in pass rush pressure rate allowed at 47.4% of their snaps -- nearly one out of every two drop backs is pressured. Bringing back guard Teven Jenkins might help a little, but they're still a struggling unit.

DEEP BALL: Washington ranks bottom-five in attempts, yards per catch and touchdowns allowed on pass plays of 15-plus Air Yards over the past three weeks. This is an area Fields can exploit -- he's tied for the most touchdowns on throws of 15-plus Air Yards this season than Fields with four and is around league-average in completion rate, attempts per game and Expected Points Added (EPA) per drop back.

LAST SEASON: Washington got a season-best 57.1% pass rush pressure rate on Fields and blitzed him on 40.5% of his drop backs. Fields had one passing touchdown and one interception and still had nearly 20 Fantasy points because he ran for 88 yards.

RUSHING: Fields followed up a Week 3 game with seven designed runs with just two designed runs in Week 4 for two total yards. On the season he's totaled 28 rushes for 134 yards and a score.

While there's potential for that on Thursday, it's not a certainty. Howell could just as easily put up nominal stats to help the Commanders bring home a win. With upside an issue, think of Howell as a sleeper with 20-point potential. I'd rather start Jordan Love, Jared Goff or Justin Fields, but taking Howell over Dak Prescott and Joe Burrow isn't crazy given their matchups and/or situations.

LAST WEEK: Bounced back from a horrid four-INT loss in Week 3 to complete nearly 71% of his throws for 290 yards with one touchdown and a very clutch 40 rushing yards at Philly. This was the most efficient game of his young career, but it was also the busiest game of his career as he threw 41 passes and ran six times. Playing into overtime helped his cause.

HOWELL: Has one game out of five as a pro with multiple passing touchdowns, and two others with one rushing and one passing score.

BEARS: Are one of the easiest matchups for a quarterback. They rank in the bottom-seven in completion rate allowed (70.1%), yards per catch allowed (12.2), Yards After Catch per reception (YAC/reception) allowed (6.26, second-most) and missed tackles (52). One more factor: Chicago ranks poorly in pass rush pressure rate, blitz rate and has just two sacks all season.

HOWELL: When not pressured has completed 73.8% of his throws for 7.2 yards per attempt with a 9.7% off-target rate. None of these are particularly impressive -- they're all about league-average -- but that's still a plus for Howell considering this week's matchup.

PASS ATTEMPTS: Through four weeks the Bears are seeing an average of 31.8 pass attempts against them per game. Even in a game the Bears led for much of last week, the Broncos tried just 28 throws. On the flip side, three of the four quarterbacks Chicago faced found three touchdowns on their limited throws.

Start Him (Lineup Decisions) Projections powered by Sportsline Terry McLaurin WR WAS Washington • #17

He's a low-end WR2 worth the nod over George Pickens, Zay Flowers, Drake London and Jahan Dotson.

PAST THREE WEEKS: McLaurin has led all Commanders wide receivers in targets and all Commanders players in receptions. He's the No. 1 guy, and his big Week 4 game (8-86-0 with an offensive fumble recovery for a touchdown) would have been even bigger if Sam Howell had better ball placement on a deep pass McLaurin was open for.

BEARS: Are expected to play again without top outside cornerback Jaylon Johnson and safety Eddie Jackson. Not that those two absences led to a bonanza from Broncos receivers; Russell Wilson spread the ball around. But if McLaurin remains the target leader then he'll have the best shot at a big game. Rookies Tyrique Stevenson and Terell Smith figure to line up across from McLaurin the most.

MATCHUPS: Each top-target earning wide receiver that plays mostly outside (like McLaurin) has found at least 10 PPR points in every game against the Bears. That includes Rashee Rice in Week 3 (7 targets, 5-59-0), Courtland Sutton in Week 4 (5 targets, 3-27-1), Romeo Doubs in Week 1 (5 targets, 4-26-2) and Mike Evans in Week 2 (8 targets, 6-171-1). Note that these receivers combined to catch 18 of 25 targets (72%) against Chicago.","NFL Fantasy Football Week 5 Lineup Decisions: Starts, Sits, Sleepers, Busts to know for every game",https://www.cbssports.com/fantasy/football/news/nfl-fantasy-football-week-5-lineup-decisions-starts-sits-sleepers-busts-to-know-for-every-game/,CBSSports.com
sports,Shanna McCarriston,2023-10-12T23:21:52+00:00,"Singer Taylor Swift has a blank space, and she's writing Travis Kelce's name. There were rumors the two were dating for weeks, and those talks only intensified with swift attending five Chiefs games so far this season, including Sunday's game agains the Chargers.

The Era's Tour singer was seen chatting with the tight end's mom, Donna Kelce, and cheering emphatically when No. 87 scored a touchdown in the first game she attended last month. Last week, she was in attendance to watch the Chiefs as they defeated the Denver Broncos in Week 6 on ""Thursday Night Football.""

She is once again at Arrowhead Stadium, this time to watch the Chiefs take on another AFC West opponent, the Los Angeles Chargers.

For those wondering how this apparent relationship came to be, wonder no longer. We have created an extensive timeline of the high-profile couple that is currently the talk of the league, and even added some Swift lyrics to go along with some of the highlights.

Here's a look at how it all started and where it has gone since:

June 29: Kelce makes friendship bracelets for fellow TEs

Is this where it all begin? Kelce made a friendship bracelet to give to the newcomers at a camp for NFL tight ends. He said he was ""taking a page out of Taylor Swift's book.""

July 26: Kelce makes friendship bracelet for Swift

""So make the friendship bracelets, take the moment and taste it."" - You're On Your Own Kid

Kelce announced that he went to Swift's highly anticipated concert, but said he did not have the chance to meet the 12-time Grammy winner.

""I was disappointed that she doesn't talk before or after her shows because she has to save her voice for the 44 songs she sings ... She doesn't meet anybody, or at least she didn't want to meet me, so I took it personal,"" Kelce said on an episode of the ""New Heights"" podcast he does with his brother, Philadelphia Eagles center Jason Kelce.

He revealed that he made a friendship bracelet, a fan tradition at her concerts, with his number on it to give to her, seemingly expressing his interest in Swift. When his brother asked if it was his jersey number or his phone number, Kelce replied, ""you know which one.""

""If you're up on Taylor Swift concerts, there are friendship bracelets and I had received a bunch of them, but I wanted to give Taylor Swift one with my number on it.""

Aug. 5: Kelce names his celebrity crush

Well before the two were rumored to be dating, Kelce was asked his crush. But before he could even answer, the answer was given for him.

Sept. 14: Rumors aren't denied

""The rumors are terrible and cruel, but honey, most of them are true."" - New Romantics

Of course people were going to ask Jason, who is very close with his brother, whether rumors of the two hanging out were true. He did not confirm them, but he also did not deny them.

Sept. 17: The references begin

""I watched it begin again."" - Begin Again

The rumors began to pick up, and now there were a lot of people, commentators included, making Swift references around Kelce.

When the tight end caught a touchdown pass from Patrick Mahomes, CBS Sports' Ian Eagle said, ""Kelce finds a blank space for the score.""

This was only the start to many, many, Swift lyrics being referenced during NFL games.

Sept. 21: Kelce sends Swift an invite

""So inviting, I almost jump in."" - Gold Rush

While on the Pat McAfee show, Kelce discussed the rumors and sounded somehow surprised people are talking about it.

""It is hilarious how much traction this has actually got,"" he said of all the talk. ""It's like that old game in school called telephone where everybody is just whispering in each others ear, just hearing some random stuff. Especially when you got Jason Kelce on live television telling people just both sides.""

He then admitted that he invited Swift to one of his games, joking that they would compete to see who put on the bigger show at Arrowhead Stadium, home of the Chiefs.

""I threw it out there, I threw the ball in her court and I told her you know, I've seen you rock the stage in Arrowhead you might have to come see me rock the stage in Arrowhead and see which one is a little more lit. We will see what happens in the near future.""

Sept. 22: Another bracelet

""Lately [he's] been dressing for revenge."" - Vigilante Sh--

Kelce was spotted at his nonprofit charity event wearing a bracelet that says ""Vigilante Sh--,"" the name of one of Swift's songs.

Sept. 24: Swift attends Chiefs game

""Dating the boy on the football team."" - Fifteen

Swift took Kelce up on his offer and attended the Chiefs' Week 3 game against the Chicago Bears. Swift was dressed on theme and was watching intently, cheering and even chest bumping someone during big plays. She was especially thrilled to see Kelce get in the end zone, a three-yard catch that put the Chiefs up 41-0. Kansas City went on to win 41-10 to improve to 2-1.

Sept. 24: Swift mingles with Donna Kelce



""Talkin' over a football team."" - Mean

Swift already seems to be making friends with the family. Swift was sitting next to Donna in the box and the two were seen talking and laughing as the game went along.

Sept. 24: Postgame interviews turn into Swiftie talk

The postgame press conference seemed more about Swift and Kelce than it did about the actual game. The media wanted any insight it could get into the relationship and how Swift ended up at Arrowhead.

""He told me at the last minute,"" Mahomes said when asked if he knew Swift was coming. ""There's some things with Trav where he kind of just says it and you don't know if it's true or not. He says it so calmly. ... Friday he was like, 'Yeah, I think she's coming to the game this weekend,' and then moved about his business.""

Head coach Andy Reid was also asked about his star tight end's supposed relationship, to which he quipped, ""I set them up.""

Sept. 24: Kelce and Swift leave stadium together

""You know when it's time to go."" - It's Time To Go

This was the first time the two were photographed together. They walked side by side, Kelce fittingly wearing an outfit with ""1989"" in the title and Swift wearing a Chiefs zip-up.

Sept. 24: The two leave in a convertible

""Nothing good starts in the getaway car."" - Getaway Car

Swift and Swift were spotted in a convertible, with the tight end driving, after the Chiefs' win. Kelce reportedly rented out a restaurant for a private party with Swift and his teammates.

""Taylor Swift likes that Travis Kelce 'pursued her' and the two are having a 'great time getting to know each other,'"" a source told Entertainment Tonight. ""'Taylor wants a guy that's into his career, does his own thing, but is also supportive and understands her,' the source added, ""and Travis fits those qualities.'""

Sept. 25: Kelce jersey sales skyrocket

Call it what you want; I'll call it the Taylor Swift effect. Since Swift attended the Chiefs game, there was a 400% increase in Kelce jersey sales, his podcast is No. 1 overall on Apple, he gained over 380,000 Instagram followers, and 24.3 million people watched the game, making it the No. 1 game last week, according to Front Office Sports.

There has also been triple the ""Chiefs"" searches on web and triple the Chiefs ticket sales on Stubhub.

Sept. 25: Belichick weighs in on the matter



New England Patriots head coach does not always comment on situations that take place in the game, but he was fully ready with a sound bite on the Kelce-Swift situation.

""Well I would say that Travis Kelce's had a lot of big catches in his career. This would be the biggest.""

Sept. 26: Chiefs games get even more popular

""Welcome to New York (*New Jersey), it's been waiting for you."" - Welcome to New York

The defending Super Bowl champions are already one of the more popular teams in the league, but it is becoming the hottest ticket in town, no matter what town that is.

""Since Swift's appearance at the Chiefs game on Sunday, the Jets have sold more tickets for their game against the Chiefs in a single day than since the season started -- by more than double,"" a representatives at StubHub told to Town & Country magazine.

Sept. 27: Mahomes confirms he met Swift

""It was enchanting to meet you, all I can say is I was enchanted to meet you."" - Enchanted

Mahomes said he had not met Swift when asked in the postgame press conference, but he did meet her at the afterparty.

""Yea I met her. She's really cool. Good people,"" Mahomes said, via KSHB 41 in Kansas City. ""But like Trav said, imma let them have their privacy and just keep it moving.""

Sept. 27: Kelce breaks his silence

""And they said speak now."" -Speak Now

Kelce addressed Swift's attendance on his podcast, saying, ""To see the slow-motion chest bumps, to see the high-fives with Mom, to see how Chiefs Kingdom was all excited that she was there -- that s--- was absolutely hysterical. It's definitely a game I'll remember, that's for damn sure.""

He is not going to speak too much more about the relationship, noting that he wants ""to respect both of our lives.""

""Yeah, my personal life -- that's not so personal. I did this to myself Jason, I know this. What's real is that you know it is my personal life. ... She's not in the media as much as I am doing this show every single week.""

Sept. 27: Jerry Jones comments on the Swift effect

Swift is getting the owners talking, too.

""It is hard to move that needle dramatically on a great feeling, a great attraction in the NFL,"" Jones said Wednesday on 105.3FM The Fan in Dallas. ""We get a lot of eye balls. She blew it off the charts. It is amazing. It makes you smile. But it just shows the depth of her following, especially with her core constituency. We all, I think, felt the same way when she's sitting up there with [Travis Kelce's] mom and she's going nuts when he's playing and those hearts are popping out everywhere. How do you not get that? That's called images right there.""

Oct. 1: Swift attends Chiefs-Jets

""Welcome to New York, it's been waiting for you,"" - Welcome to New York

OK, so the Jets technically play in New Jersey, but we're just basing this off their name. Swift went to her second consecutive Chiefs game, showing up with some famous friends, Blake Lively, Ryan Reynolds and Hugh Jackman. In the week leading up to the game, there were reports that the singer would be at the game. The Chiefs defeated the Jets 23-20.

Oct. 5: NFL defends itself

Swift coverage is everywhere and the league even changed their social media bio to one of the singer's lyrics. The league's X (formerly Twitter) bio to read, ""NFL (Taylor's Version),"" while their Instagram account read, ""Chiefs are 2-0 as Swifties.""

Some found issue with these changes, but the NFL said this is a ""pop cultural moment"" and they are acting as such.

""We frequently change our bios and profile imagery based on what's happening in and around our games, as well as culturally,"" the NFL wrote in a statement. ""The Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce news has been a pop cultural moment we've leaned into in real time, as it's an intersection of sport and entertainment, and we've seen an incredible amount of positivity around the sport.""

Oct. 6: Travis and Jason think the NFL is doing too much

The NFL is really digging into the Swift-Kelce coverage, and not everyone is a fan, including the people involved.

""I think it's fun when they show who's at the game,"" Travis said. ""I think it brings a little bit more to the atmosphere, brings a little bit more to what you're watching. But at the same time, they're overdoing it a little bit.""

Jason also chimed in on the matter, saying, ""I just think the NFL is not used to celebrities coming to the games. Like basketball has it all figured out. They're all courtside, they're sitting there. They show 'em once or twice, but then they get back to the game.""

Oct. 12: Swift attends Chiefs-Broncos

""Now it's too late for you and your white horse *Bronco, to come around"" - White Horse

One day after her movie premiere, Swift is in the house for the Chiefs' ""Thursday Night Football"" divisional matchup against the Broncos. The game is taking place at Arrowhead Stadium, where Swift has performed herself and attended a game before. According to Al Michaels, the game will have minimal Swift coverage, though so far there has already been a mention of the superstar.

Oct. 15: Kelce, Swift make 'SNL' cameos

The two were spotted out in NYC together and then had a surprise appearance on ""Saturday Night Live."" Kelce had a cameo in a skit about how much coverage Swift was getting during games, while the singer introduced the musical act of the night, Ice Spice.

Oct. 22: Swift attends fifth Chiefs game

Swift has now attended games broadcast across all five networks (CBS, NBC, Fox, ESPN and Amazon). This week, she is watching the Chiefs face the Chargers and will be shown on CBS. She is sporting a Chiefs sweatshirt and is seated next to Kansas City quarterback Patrick Mahomes' wife, Brittany.","Taylor Swift-Travis Kelce timeline: Everything to know about rumored romance between pop star, Chiefs TE",https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/news/taylor-swift-travis-kelce-timeline-everything-to-know-about-rumored-romance-between-pop-star-chiefs-te/,CBSSports.com
sports,Martin Derbyshire,2023-11-06T22:21:05+00:00,"Line shopping is the key that unlocks the best odds and lines at top sports betting sites.

The process is as simple as checking the lines and odds for your prospective bet at multiple online sports betting sites. The result is quite often better odds and improved lines.

What is line shopping, and why is it worth your time? Find the answers below in our complete guide to line shopping.

How do sportsbooks set odds and lines?

The best sportsbooks employ oddsmakers and oddsmaking services to set their lines and odds.

Other sports betting apps simply copy those lines. The oddsmakers and oddsmaking services use computer models and algorithms that consider analytics, statistics, injury and roster news, performance, matchup data, and more to develop the lines and odds.

Betting lines and odds are then subject to change based on the betting public’s reaction and any additional information that comes to light ahead of the game. Sportsbooks will move the line or change the odds if the public bets heavily on one side.

Every sportsbook’s goal is to even out the betting on both sides of every bet. That allows sportsbooks to earn the profit built into the odds and lines without worrying about which side wins.

The betting is rarely the same at every sportsbook. While one sportsbook may be forced to move a line or change the odds because of betting, another won’t. That’s when you’ll spot a difference between sportsbooks. This difference may allow you to book a bet at improved odds or a more favorable line.

The lines and odds may even be different right from the jump. Either way, the differences are why line shopping always makes sense. Shop around, and you can find opportunities to lay less, win more, and improve your chances.

Shop for the best lines at online sportsbooks

Below is a live odds feed that shows you the differences between lines and odds for the same bets at many of the top sportsbooks in the country. Look here for current opportunities.

What’s the best way to shop lines?

The easiest way to line-shop is to find something like the live odds feed above. It’s a one-stop shop. Shopping lines here will take just seconds.

Performing the task manually may take longer, but you can check with more sportsbooks or the chosen few you feel consistently offer the best lines and odds. The best way to do this is to download and install more than one of the best sports betting apps on your phone.

Then, tap around among the sportsbooks to compare lines and odds for the bets you plan.

Best sportsbooks for line shopping

The biggest brands in sports betting offer competitive lines in dozens of states. Shop around at the following top online sportsbooks to find the best prices on your bets.

Caesars Sportsbook

Caesars' odds and lines are consistently among the best in the country, making it a must-see when shopping lines. The point spreads here can be a half-point to two points better than the competition’s, and the moneyline odds may be more favorable.

BetMGM Sportsbook

The lines and odds at BetMGM are consistently competitive. Plus, sports betting promos and odds boosts abound, so you'll find a better price on many bets here.

DraftKings Sportsbook

DraftKings has more open betting markets than most online sportsbooks, and the lines and odds are always competitive.

FanDuel Sportsbook

FanDuel is committed to posting competitive odds and runs so many generous promos and odds boosts that it is always worth a look.

How to find the best lines and odds for any bet

Shopping around lets you find the best lines and odds for any bet. That means checking the posted lines and odds for the same bets at different sportsbooks.

You can do this for moneylines, point spreads, totals bets, prop bets, and more. Finding the best line or better odds on any bet is like finding money.

You can shop around using multiple sportsbook apps on your phone or live odds feeds like the one above. Pick a side, then use the drop-down menus and tabs to find the odds and lines for that bet.

Finally, bet when you see an opportunity at better odds or an improved line compared to the competition.

Line shopping for futures

People tend to bet futures at their favorite online sportsbook. However, shopping for better odds on any future bet is worth your time. Most game lines are similar at different sportsbooks, but the odds in futures markets can vary significantly.

Sportsbooks sometimes have higher liabilities for specific teams and offer better odds on others to lay that off. Timing is everything.

Get it right, and you can easily take advantage of changes in different futures markets due to liability. However, the only way to find these opportunities is shopping lines.

See more: NFL futures bets

Can I get a better line or odds after I’ve already bet?

When you bet, you lock in the odds or line as currently posted. If they change, for better or worse, you’re stuck with the odds from when you wagered.

That’s precisely why you should go line shopping before you bet. Of course, if significant changes occur, you can take more action at the improved odds or more favorable line.

Is line shopping worth my time?

Because it can provide you the opportunity to lay less, win more, and improve your chances, line shopping is certainly worth your time. Plus, it doesn’t have to take up all that much of it.

Use the live odds feed above to do a basic survey. You’ll find it takes just seconds to compare lines and odds. Plus, download and install multiple licensed online sportsbook apps on your phone, and you can do a more thorough shop in just a few minutes.

Getting more points or laying fewer on a typical NFL point spread or NBA point spread might lead to winning a bet you’d otherwise lose. Plus, if you find better odds on any bet, you can potentially drop fewer dollars when you lose and earn more when you win.

Shopping lines will help you consistently find the best prices on your bets. It won't help you pick more winners, but it will improve your chances and lead to bigger wins and more affordable losses. That’s undoubtedly worth your time.

For example, you might like the Kansas City Chiefs to beat the Cincinnati Bengals in a mid-season NFL game. Say you look around and see that three of four licensed online sportsbooks in your state have the Chiefs as -3 favorites, but the fourth has them at just -2.5.

Let’s say the Chiefs win by exactly three, a distinct possibility since a single field goal decides most NFL games. Bets at the first three sportsbooks would push. However, you’d have a winner at the fourth. If you didn’t shop around, you’d never have found that half-point victory and be stuck with a push instead of a profit.

What is the Vegas line?

Las Vegas sportsbooks set the standard for lines and odds across the country. If a sportsbook is copying a line, it’s usually copying the Vegas line. Most online betting sites don’t stray too far from the Vegas line, using it as a foundation for setting all lines in every major sport.

If those lines do shift, it’s usually because of increased betting on one side of a bet. Shop lines locally, and you can take advantage when sportsbooks stray from the Vegas line.

Why do the lines move?

It’s worth reiterating that sportsbooks want an equal amount of money bet on each side of every bet. When that happens, they earn the small profit built into the odds without concern about who wins or loses.

Sportsbooks want even betting so much that they’ll move a line or change the odds to draw more bets to the other side to get it that way.

That’s when you’ll see a difference between the lines and odds. Every sportsbook jumps on board when a line moves or odds change for a legitimate reason, like an injury or roster move. It’ll be difficult for you to find value in that case.

But when a line moves or odds change because of betting patterns, only the sportsbook that saw the betting makes the change. That’s your opportunity right there.

Line shopping is a tool to help you spot changes due to betting patterns. Then, you can simply take advantage of movement in a line or changes in the odds.

Choose a side, shop around at online sportsbooks, compare the lines and odds, and then pounce when you find one that has something different and more favorable to your viewpoint.

sports,Sam Eggleston,2023-11-01T21:25:48+00:00,"The primary draw of the moneyline bet lies in its simplicity. Even those just dipping their toes into the world of sports betting for the first time can quickly get a handle on the basics of the moneyline.

On this page we'll unpack the ins and outs of moneyline betting in more detail.

What is a moneyline bet?

So, what's the essence of a moneyline bet? In this type of bet, the sole focus is identifying the winner.

The victory margin and the total points scored have no bearing. It doesn't matter if your chosen team clinches a win with a score of 2-1 or a blowout of 50-0; the payout remains unchanged.

In this way, the moneyline distills sports to their essence: cheering for a victor.

Every moneyline bet has a favorite and an underdog as determined by the sportsbook. In the context of moneyline betting, ""favorites"" and ""underdogs"" refer to the perceived stronger and weaker participants, respectively.

Favorites:

The favorite is the participant (be it a team or an individual) who is expected to win the event or matchup.

In moneyline odds, especially in American odds format, the favorite is usually represented with a minus (-) sign. For instance, if Team A is a favorite and is listed at -150, a bettor would need to wager $150 to win $100.

Underdogs:

The underdog is the participant deemed less likely to win compared to the opponent.

Underdogs in moneyline odds, particularly in the American odds format, are usually represented with a plus (+) sign. If Team B is an underdog and has odds of +130, a bettor would win $130 for every $100 they bet, should Team B win.

Moneyline odds formats

You'll typically encounter three types of odds when researching and handicapping across various platforms—decimal, fractional, and American.

Most listings on the best online sports betting sites predominantly use American Odds.

American Odds

You'll usually see these displayed as either a negative (-) or positive (+) number, symbolizing different implications in the betting world.

The negative numbers might seem a bit perplexing at first. They point to the team, player, or option considered the favorite to win.

This number can also represent wagers that are less than even money. Essentially, the negative figure tells you how much you need to bet to earn a profit of $100. We'll clarify with an example shortly.

Conversely, positive odds signal the underdog in the betting scenario or bets that offer more than even money. This figure shows how much profit you'll make on a $100 wager.

To illustrate with a moneyline bet: Imagine on a top NFL betting site the New England Patriots are listed as -110 favorites, while the New York Jets stand at +250.

You decide to back the favorite and bet $110 on the Pats. The Pats win, and you end up with $210.

That sum comprises your initial $110 bet and the $100 profit you've earned.

Fractional Odds

While you might occasionally encounter these odds, especially in contexts like horse racing, they're quite straightforward once you get the hang of them, even if they initially seem like a math problem.

These odds typically look like two numbers separated by a slash (/) or a dash (-), resembling a fraction. For instance, you might see 5/1 or 5-1.

Here's a simple way to interpret fractions: the first number (akin to the numerator in math) represents potential profit, while the second (akin to the denominator) indicates the amount you need to stake.

In other words, the denominator tells you how much you need to bet to earn a profit equivalent to the numerator.

For example, with 2/1 odds, you'd earn $2 for every $1 you wager. Conversely, with 4/9 odds, a bet of $9 would yield a $4 profit.

To further illustrate, if you placed a bet of $9 at 4/9 odds and won, you'd receive $13 in total: your initial $9 stake plus the $4 profit.

Decimal Odds

Decimals are to betting what the metric system is to measurements: straightforward and user-friendly. They present fewer intricacies compared to their American and fractional counterparts.

However, just as the metric system is not universally embraced in the US, decimal odds can also be overlooked there.

Fortunately, working with decimal odds is simple. To determine a bet's payout, you multiply the decimal odds by the amount you're betting.

For instance, if the odds on an NHL betting site have the Edmonton Oilers at 2.53 to beat the Detroit Red Wings, a $10 bet would yield a $25.30 return. This includes your initial $10 wager, along with a profit of $15.30.

It's essential to note that this calculation gives you the total payout, not just your earnings. If you're keen on tracking your profits from betting, remember to subtract your original stake from the payout to get an accurate figure.

Why do moneyline odds change?

Lines at the best sports betting apps change quickly due to two primary reasons:

Public betting

New information

Before setting odds for an event, oddsmakers gather extensive data. Once they finalize the odds, they release them to the public.

As a bettor, you can bet immediately or wait for potential shifts in the odds, although predicting these shifts is challenging.

For instance, when examining odds for the next Super Bowl champion released shortly after the previous Super Bowl, these odds are based mostly on the recently concluded season.

As the new season approaches and teams make changes, odds adjust based on perceived championship chances. As games progress, lines continue to evolve based on team performances.

Public betting can also sway lines. If too many wagers favor one outcome, sportsbooks adjust the odds to balance the bets. This ensures an even distribution of bets and reduces the sportsbook's financial risk.

Moneyline betting outcomes

When you’re placing a moneyline wager, several outcomes are possible. The most straightforward outcome is a win or a loss, determined by whether the team or individual you bet on is victorious or defeated.

There's also the possibility of a draw, which occurs if the event ends in a tie.

Moneyline win

Winning a moneyline bet is very straightforward. All you need to do is pick the team or individual who is going to win an event and choose correctly.

If you bet on a boxing match between Boxer A and Boxer B, and you've bet on Boxer B to win and he does, then your bet would be successful and you'd get paid based on the odds at the time you placed your wager.

Moneyline loss

When placing a moneyline wager, a loss simply means that the team or individual you bet on did not win the event or matchup.

For example, let's say on an NBA betting site you bet on a basketball game between Team A and Team B. You believe Team A will win, so you place a $100 moneyline wager on them. If Team B wins, your bet on Team A would be a loss.

Draw

In some sports, notably soccer, games can end in a draw, and bettors have the option to wager on this outcome. When placing a moneyline wager in such situations, you'll typically see three sets of odds: one for each team to win and one for the game to end in a draw.

For instance, consider a soccer match between Team A and Team B. The moneyline odds might look something like this:

Team A: +150

+150 Draw: +220

+220 Team B: +180

If you believe the game will end in a tie, you could place a $100 wager on the ""Draw"" option. If the match indeed concludes with a tied score, you would win based on the +220 odds. This means you'd receive $220 in profit on top of your $100 stake, totaling $320. However, if either Team A or Team B wins, you'd lose your $100 wager.

Moneyline betting examples by sport

Below are some examples of typical moneyline bets you'll find for various professional sports.

Moneyline odds in football

NFL moneyline odds for a game between the Dallas Cowboys and the New York Giants might look something like this:

Dallas Cowboys: -130

-130 New York Giants: +110

Here, the Cowboys are the favorites, indicated by the negative odds. If you bet $130 on the Cowboys and they win, you would earn a profit of $100.

The New York Giants are the underdogs, as shown by the positive odds. If you wager $100 on the Giants and they pull off an upset victory, you would earn a profit of $110.

Moneyline odds in basketball

NBA moneyline odds for a game between the Los Angeles Lakers and the Miami Heat might be presented as:

Los Angeles Lakers: -150

-150 Miami Heat: +130

In this scenario, the Lakers are favored to win, as indicated by the negative odds. If you back the Lakers with a bet of $150 and they win, you would earn a profit of $100.

The Heat are the underdogs. If you place a $100 bet on the Heat and they win, your profit would be $130.

Moneyline odds in baseball

MLB moneyline odds for a game between the New York Yankees and the Boston Red Sox might look like this:

New York Yankees: -120

-120 Boston Red Sox: +100

The Yankees are slight favorites. If you bet $120 on the Yankees and they win, you'd earn a profit of $100. The Red Sox have even odds, shown by the +100. This means if you bet $100 on the Red Sox and they win, you'd also earn a profit of $100.

Moneyline odds in hockey

NHL moneyline odds for a game between the Toronto Maple Leafs and the Chicago Blackhawks might be displayed as:

Toronto Maple Leafs: -140

-140 Chicago Blackhawks: +120

If you put down $140 on the Maple Leafs and they win, you would earn a profit of $100. If you bet $100 on the Blackhawks and they pull off a win, you'd receive a profit of $120.

Moneyline odds in soccer

Soccer moneyline odds for an MLS match between the Seattle Sounders and Atlanta United might look like this:

Seattle Sounders: +110

+110 Draw: +230

+230 Atlanta United: +140

In this scenario, neither team is a clear favorite, but the Seattle Sounders have slightly better odds. If you bet $100 on the Sounders and they win, you'd earn a profit of $110.

If you believe the match might end in a tie, you could place a bet on the ""Draw"" option. A $100 bet on a draw would result in a $230 profit if the match ends tied.

Meanwhile, if you back Atlanta United with a $100 wager and they win, you'd secure a profit of $140.

Remember, in soccer, the possibility of a draw is a common outcome to bet on, which is different from many other major sports.

Moneyline odds in MMA/UFC

UFC moneyline odds for a fight between Conor McGregor and Dustin Poirier might look like this:

Conor McGregor: -200

-200 Dustin Poirier: +170

If you bet $200 on McGregor and he wins the fight, you'd earn a profit of $100. If you bet $100 on Poirier and he wins, you would earn a profit of $170.

Moneyline odds in tennis

Tennis odds for a match between Serena Williams and Maria Sharapova might be displayed as:

Serena Williams: -150

-150 Maria Sharapova: +130

In this hypothetical matchup, Serena is the favorite to win. If you bet $150 on Williams and she wins, you would earn a profit of $100. Sharapova is the underdog. If you place a $100 wager on Sharapova and she manages to win, you'll receive a profit of $130.

Moneyline odds in golf

Let's consider some PGA tour odds at one of the best golf betting sites where you're betting on an individual golfer to win. The moneyline odds might be presented as:

Tiger Woods: +500

+500 Rory McIlroy: +600

In this hypothetical tournament scenario, neither golfer is a strong favorite, but the odds indicate their perceived chances to win. If you decide to bet $100 on Tiger Woods and he wins the tournament, you'd earn a profit of $500.

On the other hand, if you place a $100 wager on Rory McIlroy and he clinches the tournament victory, you'd secure a profit of $600.

It's important to note that in PGA and other golf tournaments, there are usually many players, so the odds can be much higher than in head-to-head sports matchups, given the broader field of competition.

Moneyline Betting FAQ

How do moneyline bets work?

Moneylines hinge on the outright winner of a game or event. They are presented with either a positive (+) or negative (-) sign:

A positive moneyline (+) indicates the underdog and represents the amount of profit on a $100 bet.

A negative moneyline (-) indicates the favorite and shows how much you need to bet to earn a $100 profit.

What happens if there’s a tie in a moneyline bet?

If there's a tie in a moneyline bet, it is typically referred to as a ""push."" When a push occurs, bettors are refunded their original wager. No money is won or lost. However, sports that typically have the possibility of a tie (like soccer) often provide bettors with the option to bet on a draw.

If the game ends in a draw and you haven't bet on that option, you would lose your bet. It's essential to understand the specific rules of the sportsbook and the sport you're betting on to know how ties are handled.

Does overtime count in my moneyline bet?

Yes, in most sports and with most sportsbooks (including new betting sites), overtime (or any extra time or tiebreakers) does count in a moneyline bet.

That said, always check the specific rules of the sportsbook you're using to ensure you understand their policies.

Why do moneyline odds change?

Moneyline odds change for several reasons.

Public Betting Patterns: If a significant amount of money is being placed on one team or participant, sportsbooks might adjust the odds to balance their liability. By making the odds less favorable for a heavily-bet team and more favorable for the less-bet team, they can encourage more even betting.

Victor Wembanyama: Coach Gregg Popovich's Spurs have a gem in Victor Wembanyama, a generational talent and a strong Rookie of the Year contender. Even with a young roster and potential load management, Wembanyama's undeniable impact is evident.

His elite defense, highlighted by his 7-foot-4 height and 8-foot wingspan, allows him to dominate where others can't. Offensively, his agility and skill set are unparalleled for his size. If he refines his shooting and continues to adapt to the Spurs' style, as seen in his impressive NBA preseason performance, he'll be a force to reckon with.

The earlier you bet on NBA ROTY, the better the odds. But you’ll be doing so without much information that could be key in making an educated decision.

Conversely, if you wait for the data you need for an informed bet, the odds will tighten up, and you will see less of a return on your wager.

When the lines are first released for NBA ROTY honors, the season hasn’t even started yet, so there are no statistics, trends, or player news. The pre-season odds are so favorable because even the oddsmakers don’t have the data to craft more specific lines.

Once the season has started and you get to see how the various rookies are performing, you can gather the relevant data. But sportsbooks are also gathering this information, and they begin to tighten the NBA Rookie of the Year lines in response.

So, while you can better guess which player will hoist the Wilt Chamberlain Trophy, the odds will be tighter, and your potential return on your wager will be reduced.

Pros and cons of betting early on the NBA Rookie of the Year:

Pros:

You have an opportunity to find better value.

The betting odds are fresh and haven't been adjusted.

Cons:

There is a much higher risk as a player's performance, health, and team dynamic can change throughout the season.

You’ll find limited information to make an informed bet.

Pros and cons of waiting to bet on the NBA Rookie of the Year:

Pros:

There is a lot more information available to make an informed bet.

You don’t risk betting on a player not remotely in contention.

Cons:

There is a reduced opportunity to find value.

The odds may not be as favorable.

Keep in mind that it’s always important to take into consideration your risk tolerance while you weigh the potential rewards. No matter when you decide to make your wager, always gather as much information as possible before risking your hard-earned money.

Who are the past NBA ROTY winners?

For context, here is a list of the National Basketball Association Rookie of the Year winners since 2010.

What other NBA futures can I bet on?

Rookie of the Year is not the only form of NBA futures betting. Legal online sportsbooks have a wide selection of NBA futures you can bet on, including:

In addition to futures bets, you can wager on many NBA bets during the regular season and postseason. NBA game lines (moneylines, point spreads, and totals) are the most popular, but you’ll also be able to bet on NBA team and player props, parlays, and more.

The NBA is the second-most popular odds market to bet on in the US, behind NFL betting odds.

sports,James Wallace,2023-12-12T21:49:56+00:00,"13 Dec 2023 02.36 GMT James Wallace That’s it from me this evening/morning. Time to haul myself out of the OBO armchair and skulk off for some kip. That was an intriguing game and sets up this T20I series nicely. A real statement has been laid down by Rovman Powell and his men, West Indies were up against it early doors with England crunching their way to 112-2 off the first ten overs but Jos Buttler’s side only managed to make 59 runs off the next ten, losing eight wickets along the way. A total of 171 was thirty or more shy of where England would have liked to have ended up and so it proved as West Indies peeled up their sleeves and showed how muscular their own batting card is – the home side cleared the ropes fourteen times compared to England’s six. Andre Russell and Rovman Powell found the stands with ease at the business end of the match to get West Indies over the line with eleven balls remaining. We’ll be back to cover the second match in Grenada on Thursday, do join us for that. Until then, thank you and goodnight.

Updated at 02.36 GMT

13 Dec 2023 02.28 GMT Andre Russell is Player of the Match: In his first T20I in over two years he took 3-29 and smashed 29* off just 14 deliveries with the game in the balance. He seems very pleased to be back in maroon. Life is so funny. Since when I got selected for the West Indies two weeks ago I’ve been dreaming of being man of the match.”



13 Dec 2023 02.09 GMT West Indies win by 4 wickets! Andre Russell smashes the winning runs off Sam Curran! A length ball is spanked over point for a one bounce four to give the home side the win, they go 1-0 up in the series.

Updated at 02.29 GMT

13 Dec 2023 02.07 GMT 18th over: West Indies 168-6 (Powell 31, Russell 25) Adil Rashid is recalled for his final over, can he turn the game back to England? Nope. ANDRE RUSSELL SMASHES THE RASHID GOOGLY CLEAN OUT OF THE GROUND! Huge SIX! The big man even allows himself a coy smile. He enjoyed that one. A dot the next ball is followed by a powerful drive all along the baize for four! Eleven in total off the over and West Indies now just need four runs.



13 Dec 2023 02.01 GMT 17th over: West Indies 157-6 (Powell 31, Russell 14) Tymal Mills is entrusted. Singles off the first two balls. Powell swipes a full ball into the deep to collect a couple. SIX! Mills goes short and Powell gets a mighty top edge for a maximum! Fortune favours the brave, the Windies skipper gave that everything and it could have gone anywhere. Mills sends one down the leg side – wide ball. Pressure on the bowler here… Shot! Short and wide from Mills and sent to the fence with Swiss clock timing by Powell. Sixteen off the over, looking terminal for Buttler and co. 15 needed from 18 balls.



13 Dec 2023 01.55 GMT 16th over: West Indies 141-6 (Powell 26, Russell 4) Livingstone continues. Four singles off the first four balls keeps the pressure on the West Indies. HOLD THAT THOUGHT. Rovman Powell crunches consecutive sixes down the ground with a shrug and swagger to make it sixteen off the over. The scales tip once more, England need to do away with one or both of Powell and Russell – there’s no way they don’t win this for West Indies if they are there at the end. 31 needed from 24 balls.



13 Dec 2023 01.51 GMT 15th over: West Indies 125-6 (Powell 12, Russell 2) Andre Russell the man to face the hattrick ball… Boo! A decent ball on the stumps is patted back by the big man. Drama in Barbados, Russell works for a couple. Ahmed takes his cap with a broad smile on his face – he hasn’t had it all his own way but finishes with 3-39 from his set of four. Advantage England? 47 needed from 30 balls.

Updated at 01.54 GMT

13 Dec 2023 01.47 GMT WICKET! Shepherd c Curran b Rehan Ahmed 0 (West Indies 123-6) Rehan Ahmed on a hattrick! Buttler brings Curran into slip and Shepherd pokes a leggie to him off his very first ball. Great stuff from Rehan who has turned the game England’s way in the space of a minute.



13 Dec 2023 01.45 GMT WICKET! Shai Hope c Brook b Rehan Ahmed 36 (West Indies 123-5) Ahmed is bunted for SIX by Shai Hope but strikes with the next ball as Hope holes out!



13 Dec 2023 01.44 GMT 14th over: West Indies 112-4 (Hope 27, Powell 10) Liam Livingstone instead of Rashid and he does well to keep it to singles, England trying to take this as deep as possible and hope West Indies fluff their lines at the death. West Indies need 55 from 36 balls.



13 Dec 2023 01.41 GMT 13th over: West Indies 112-4 (Hope 27, Powell 10) Rehan has two balls left to complete his over. The first ball is flayed for four by Powell behind point! Valuable runs for West Indies. Rehan’s final ball is a dot, defended by Powell into the off side. West Indies need 60 from 42 balls.

Updated at 01.42 GMT

13 Dec 2023 01.30 GMT Simon Burnton is our man in Barbados and he sends good news! “It’s a 9.35pm restart. We haven’t lost any overs.” We should be underway in about eight minutes. I believe that 10.10pm local time is the cut off for the match – that’ll be 2.10am here in London town. Excuse me whilst I head to the kitchen to microdose some Kenco.



13 Dec 2023 01.14 GMT Promising news – the rain seems to be tailing off and a rope is being dragged around the outfield to take off any excess water. I’ll bring news as soon as it wafts over from Barbados to my sofa.



13 Dec 2023 01.00 GMT Rain stops play (West Indies 108-4 and require 64 runs off 44 balls) What’s all this then? Out of nowhere the heavens crack like an inky brûlée and rain starts to pour. The players scurry off as the covers are hauled on. Crucially – West Indies are six runs ahead of the Duckworth Lewis Stern rate. IF the rain doesn’t abate – and it looks heavy at the moment – then the home side will take the spoils. 12.4 overs: West Indies 108-4 (Hope 27, Powell 6)

Updated at 01.09 GMT

13 Dec 2023 00.58 GMT 12th over: West Indies 102-4 (Hope 26, Hetmyer 1) Just a single and the wicket off the over, Shai Hope can’t break the legspin shackles. Windies skipper Rovman Powell is the new man and Buttler cranks the pressure by inserting a slip.

Updated at 01.04 GMT

13 Dec 2023 00.52 GMT WICKET! Hetmyer c Duckett b Rashid 1 (West Indies 101-4) Adil Rashid takes his 100th T20I wicket! A crucial one in the context of the game too – the dangerous Hetmyer is sent on his way for just a single as England look to ramp up the pressure heading into the nub end of this match. Hetmyer danced out of his crease and got a good piece of the length ball but it flew flat and hard to Duckett on the midwicket sponge. And he does it on his 100th T20I appearance! 💯#BBCCricket #WIvENG pic.twitter.com/LYhUBtNnUj — Test Match Special (@bbctms) December 13, 2023

Updated at 01.02 GMT

13 Dec 2023 00.49 GMT WICKET! Pooran c & b Rehan Ahmed 13 (West Indies 100-3) Rehan back into the attack after his first over was minced for n n n n nineteen. Got him! Pooran flicks back a full ball and Rehan takes a nifty catch tumbling away to his left. Shimron Hetymer is the new batter and he tucks a single into the leg side to open his account. The wicket has given Ahmed a confidence boost and he gets out of the over with three dots. 11th over: West Indies 101-3 (Hope 25, Hetmyer 1)



13 Dec 2023 00.43 GMT 10th over: West Indies 99-2 (Hope 25, Pooran 13) Rashid is given another after his excellent first over. The googly is spotted by Pooran and driven down the ground handsomely for SIX! A glide behind point bring a single, Hope returns the favour with a flick into the leg side. A short ball is panned into the deep by Pooran for a couple to end the over. Bon Jovi O’clock – West Indies need 73 from 60. Time for a quick slurp for the players and a knuckle stretch for me. Is there anybody alive out there?!



13 Dec 2023 00.37 GMT 9th over: West Indies 87-2 (Hope 23, Pooran 3) Will the wickets slow the Windies as they did England? Rehan is replaced by Tymal Mills who starts with another wide. Rusty stuff so far from the southpaw seamer. That’s better – a series of slower balls and back of the hand trickery restricts Pooran and Hope before the final ball is top edged over Buttler’s head for a one bounce four. West Indies need 85 from 66 balls.



13 Dec 2023 00.32 GMT WICKET! Kyle Mayers c Brook b Rashid 35 (West Indies 79-3) The sorcerer follows his apprentice and bags a wicket first ball! That’s Rashid’s 99th T20I wicket – in truth it was a bit of a drag down but from the front of the hand so it skidded onto Mayers who didn’t time it and was caught by Brook in the deep. England needed that BIG TIME. A masterclass from Rashid in the rest of the over, Nicholas Pooran is the new man and his clip for one is the only run from the over. 8th over: West Indies 79-2 (Hope 19, Pooran 1)

Updated at 00.56 GMT

13 Dec 2023 00.28 GMT 7th over: West Indies 78-1 (Mayers 35, Hope 19) Rehan to Kyle Mayers. First ball is dragged down and launched over the midwicket boundary for SIX. Pressure on the young leggie. What a shot! Mayers holds the pose as he lofts a supreme drive down the ground for SIX more. Brutal elegance. Rehan comes back well with two sharply turning leggies. Bosh! Shai Hope gets in on the act and smears a length ball over mid on for the third six of the over. It’s a learning curve for the tyro spinner but that doesn’t make it any less bruising.



13 Dec 2023 00.23 GMT 6th over: West Indies 59-1 (Mayers 22, Hope 13) Curran is called back, Mills granted just the one over for the time being. Two slower balls bring two soothing dots for England. A single each to Mayers and Hope. Curran does very well to get out of the over with just three runs conceded. Powerplay complete. How long till we see some spin from Rehan? Not long at all, he’s on for the next over.



13 Dec 2023 00.20 GMT 5th over: West Indies 56-1 (Mayers 20, Hope 12) Woakes continues, after five balls he’s gone for just three runs. Can he get out of the over cheaply? No – A length ball is clubbed down the ground for SIX with a minimum of fuss by Shai Hope. West Indies have come out of the traps as well as England did, one over of the Powerplay left.



13 Dec 2023 00.16 GMT 4th over: West Indies 47-1 (Mayers 18, Hope 5) Tymal Mills comes onto bowl for England for the first time in eighteen months, he has plenty of T20 skills up his sleeve, can he showcase them here? Hmmm, a couple of wides slanted down the leg side isn’t the best of starts. Mills lets out a hearty groan at the second. Two full balls are worked for singles… Kablammo! Mills to Mayers – short ball – pulled onto the roof for SIX! What a shot, new ball please! DROP! And it is Ben Duckett who shells it! It would have been even better than the first grab but the ball smashes into his palm as he leaps to his right and comes straight out. They stick or they don’t. It’s all happening.



13 Dec 2023 00.10 GMT 3rd over: West Indies 36-1 (Mayers 10, Hope 4) Shai Hope is the new man and digs out a Woakes yorker and somehow manages to crunch it away down the ground for four. The replay of the Duckett catch is extremely enjoyable, Woakes owes him one for that as it was a poor ball outside off stump.



13 Dec 2023 00.07 GMT WICKET! Brandon King c Duckett b Woakes 22 (West Indies 32-1) Chris Woakes into the attack to replace the beleaguered Sam Curran. OH. MY. LORDY. Ben Duckett flies to his left at backward point to pull off a spectacular diving catch off a full blooded cut shot from King. Stunner!



13 Dec 2023 00.03 GMT 2nd over: West Indies 30-0 (King 21, Mayers 9) Will Jacks to bowl his workmanlike spin at the other end. Uh-Oh! He drops short and Kyle Mayers murders it, the ball lands on the roof of the stadium. That deserved everything it got. Mayers cuts for three behind point and then King skips jauntily out of his crease to skim the ball for four down the ground!



12 Dec 2023 23.59 GMT 1st over: West Indies 16-0 (King 16, Mayers) Brandon King gets the home side off to a blistering start, sending Sam Curran down the ground for four and swiping a brace of SIXES over mid-wicket. Game on!



12 Dec 2023 23.56 GMT No sooner have I sploshed some water on me teabag… the players emerge. West Indies need 172 to win!



12 Dec 2023 23.48 GMT An innings of two halves for England From 77 for no loss to 171 all out with three balls to spare. England's recent white ball approach is a variable one yielding mixed...often frustrating results #WIvENG — Aatif Nawaz (@AatifNawaz) December 12, 2023



12 Dec 2023 23.47 GMT Time to stick the kettle on and raid the fridge before West Indies start their chase. 3-19 for Andre Russell on his comeback for West Indies, balancing the attack perfectly.



Russell at his best adds so much to West Indies's side. With him at 7, and Holder, Shepherd and Hosein to follow, West Indies bat incredibly deep — Tim Wigmore (@timwig) December 12, 2023

Updated at 23.48 GMT

12 Dec 2023 23.46 GMT England all out 171! Tymal Mills gets a gossamer thin edge through to Pooran and England are all out with three deliveries to spare! What a turnaround for West Indies who were staring down the barrel with England flying 77-0 after six overs.



12 Dec 2023 23.44 GMT WICKET! Rashid b Joseph 0 (England 170-9) Rashid goes to swipe Joseph in the final over and hacks the ball onto his timbers. England nine down…



12 Dec 2023 23.42 GMT WICKET! Ahmed c Powell b Russell 1 (England 169-8) Rehan Ahmed follows shortly after, trying to smear a length ball down the ground he can only find Powell lurking ten yards in from the sponge. Russell gets two in the over and finishes his spell and his first T20I in two years with figures of 3-19. Nicely done. 19th over: England 169-8 (Woakes 2, Rashid 0)



12 Dec 2023 23.37 GMT WICKET! Livingstone b Russell 27 (England 167-7) Livingstone chops a cutter from Russell onto his stumps!

sports,Rob Smyth,2023-12-21T19:39:01+00:00,"6d ago 23.36 GMT Jos Buttler’s reaction We probably didn’t adapt quickly enough with the bat – I thought 16o w0uld have been a decent score on a used wicket. It was a fantastic bowling effort; we did well to hang in the game as long as we did. Phil Salt has had a brilliant series. We found out lots about ourselves as a team. [On the stop-clock experiment] It was only in the last game that we really noticed it. It’s good to keep the game moving.



6d ago 23.19 GMT England’s miserable white-ball year ends with another series defeat. Plenty of good has come from this series, though, most notably the performance of Phil Salt. While there are a few slots to fill, most notably at No3, they are in reasonable shape ahead of nexr year’s World Cup.

Updated at 23.20 GMT

6d ago 23.16 GMT I suppose it’s appropriate that it ended with a six, the 120th of the series. Hope played a gem of an innings there, calmly anchoring West Indies in an increasingly nervous chase with a run-a-ball 43. England fought admirably to defend a below-par total; but for Hope, they would probably have done it.

Updated at 23.34 GMT

6d ago 23.13 GMT 19.1 overs: West Indies 127-6 (Hope 37, Holder 4) Holder inside edges Woakes this far wide of leg stump for three runs. It would have been four but for an outstanding stop from Rehan Ahmed.



6d ago 23.12 GMT 19th over; West Indies 124-6 (Hope 37, Holder 1) Holder is almost run out first ball! He took a very dodgy single to mid-off and was well short of the crease when Curran just failed to gather Rashid’s throw. Nine to win from six balls, Chris Woakes to bowl them.



6d ago 23.10 GMT WICKET! West Indies 123-6 (Russell c Livingstone b Curran 3) Oh my. Russell slugs a low full toss straight down the throat of Livingstone at long-on, and England – who have been behind the game throughout this innings – are again dreaming of an improbable victory. West Indies need 10 from 7 balls.



6d ago 23.09 GMT 18.4 overs: West Indies 123-5 (Hope 37, Russell 3) Sam Curran concedes only one run from the first four balls of a superb penultimate over. The ball is getting very wet, though, so there’s a short break in play while England call for a dry towel. West Indies need 10 from 8 balls.



6d ago 23.04 GMT 18th over: West Indies 122-5 (Hope 36, Russell 3) Jos Buttler gambles by continuing with Rehan Ahmed, who has been relatively expensive. It doesn’t come off: Hope skims a back cut between short third and backward point for four to move the requirement back below a run a ball. It’s very hard to see how England can with this now.



6d ago 23.00 GMT 17th over: West Indies 114-5 (Hope 30, Russell 1) The wicket England really need is that of Shai Hope, who is quietly guiding West Indies towards the finish line.



6d ago 22.57 GMT WICKET! West Indies 113-5 (Powell c Rashid b Topley 8) England haven’t given this up. Powell edges Topley to short third man, where Rashid takes a smart low catch to his left. West Indies need 20 from 21 balls. Reece Topley (right) celebrates the dismissal of Rovman Powell. Photograph: Randy Brooks/AFP/Getty Images

Updated at 23.07 GMT

6d ago 22.54 GMT 16th over: West Indies 112-4 (Hope 29, Powell 8) Hope, who is playing an exemplary innings, opens the face to steer Rehan for his first boundary. Rehan has struggled as the series has progressed, an d later in the over Powell muscles him over long-on for six. West Indies are 21 runs away from a hat-trick of T20 series wins this year: South Africa away, India and England at home.



6d ago 22.50 GMT 15th over: West Indies 99-4 (Hope 23, Powell 1) Rashid finishes with figures of 4-0-21-2. He’s had a great series: eight wickets at 15 with an absurd economy rate of 6.26. But he’s going to end on the losing side.



6d ago 22.48 GMT WICKET! West Indies 95-4 (Rutherford c Curran b Rashid 30) Buttler brings back Rashid for his final over, knowing it’s now or never for England, and gets an immediate reward. Rutherford smashes a drive towards short extra, where Curran dives to his left to take a superb catch. It’s not the despair, Laura…



6d ago 22.45 GMT 14th over: West Indies 94-3 (Hope 19, Rutherford 30) West Indies are rushing towards a series victory. Rutherford hooks the new bowler Sam Curran for six more, and there are 11 from the over in total. Rutherford has 30 from 23 balls, Hope 19 from 28. They’re playing their roles to perfection.



6d ago 22.40 GMT 13th over: West Indies 83-3 (Hope 17, Rutherford 21) Rehan Ahmed returns, perhaps in the hope of tempting Rutherford into one big shot too many. Instead it’s Shai Hope, who is happily playing the anchor role, who faces five of the six deliveries. England are running out of time.



6d ago 22.37 GMT 12th over: West Indies 80-3 (Hope 15, Rutherford 20) England appeal unsuccessfully for caught behind when Rutherford misses a swipe at Rashid. There’s only one review left and they decide not to risk it. A good job too; there was nothing on UltraEdge. Out of nothing Rutherford launches a full ball from Rashid down the ground for six, almost knocking himself off his feet in the process. West Indies are managing an awkward chase pretty well.



6d ago 22.33 GMT 11th over: West Indies 71-3 (Hope 14, Rutherford 12) After 23 balls without a West Indian boundary, Rutherford lifts Moeen handsomely over extra cover for four. That’s an excellent shot which keeps West Indies in control of the run-chase.

Updated at 22.33 GMT

6d ago 22.28 GMT 10th over: West Indies 62-3 (Hope 12, Rutherford 5) West Indies know how dangerous Rashid is and are content to sit on him. I think that was Charles’ plan as well, but then he saw a low full toss and his brain went rogue. Time for drinks, after which West Indies need 71 from 60 balls.



6d ago 22.25 GMT Rutherford is not out! I need someone else’s glasses: it was comfortably missing leg stump and England have lost a review.



6d ago 22.25 GMT ENGLAND REVIEW FOR LBW AGAINST RUTHERFORD! This looks really close. Rutherford pushed around a legbreak from Rashid and was hit on the pad in front of middle and leg.



6d ago 22.24 GMT 9th over: West Indies 58-3 (Hope 11, Rutherford 2) Moeen replaces Rehan and rushes through a pretty good over, four singles from it. West Indies are still on top but another wicket would make things very interesting.



6d ago 22.21 GMT WICKET! West Indies 54-3 (Charles c Buttler b Rashid 27) Adil Rashid strikes straight away. On this occasion it had nothing to do with his bowling, but maybe a little to do with his aura. He accidentally bowled a very wide, dipping full toss to Charles, who clunked it low to Jos Buttler at short extra cover. Adil Rashid (right) celebrates the dismissal of Johnson Charles (left).

Updated at 22.43 GMT

6d ago 22.17 GMT 7th over: West Indies 51-2 (Charles 26, Hope 7) Rehan Ahmed’s first over disappears for 12. It started quite gently, with four singles and a two off the first five balls, but then Charles clattered a no-nonsense straight six. “We’re not going to win this, Rob,” writes Guy Hornsby. “But I’m just here to say I’m still watching for Woakes’ seam position and Rehan’s googly. That is all.”



6d ago 22.13 GMT 6th over: West Indies 39-2 (Charles 16, Hope 5) Charles mistimes a short ball from Woakes just short of Moeen in the covers. In the end Moeen does well to save the boundary. This has been a good fightback by England, with only nine runs scored in the last three overs.



6d ago 22.09 GMT 5th over: West Indies 37-2 (Charles 15, Hope 4) Topley continues, which makes sense because the spinners will be doing most of the work after the Powerplay, and concedes only three runs. He has quietly had a good series and is comfortably the most economical seamer on either side.



6d ago 22.05 GMT 4th over: West Indies 34-2 (Charles 15, Hope 1) England needed early wickets to have a realistic chance of victory. One more in the Powerplay, before they bring on Adil Rashid, would put them right back in the game.



6d ago 22.03 GMT WICKET! West Indies 33-2 (Pooran b Woakes 10) UltraEdge shows Pooran did edge that ball from Topley – but it doesn’t matter because Woakes has got him! Pooran tried to ride the bounce of an awkward delivery that cramped him for room, took the inside of an angled bat and ricocheted onto the stumps. Nicholas Pooran looks glum as his bails go flying.

Updated at 22.15 GMT

6d ago 21.59 GMT 3rd over: West Indies 30-1 (Charles 13, Pooran 9) Nicholas Pooran strolls to the crease and launches his second ball over midwicket for six. And why not. England thought he had edged the next ball to the keeper, though eventually they ran out of time to review. West Indies need 103 from 17 overs. “Evening Rob,” says Kim Thonger. “Jolly exciting this game, in a damaged sort of way. It occurs to me perhaps T20 internationals need a complete rebrand. May I propose we rename them Ecky Thump. The term was Introduced in Kung Fu Kapers, a 1975 episode of BBC comedy The Goodies. In the episode, ‘ecky thump’ is a secret Lancastrian martial art using black puddings as a weapon. I’m not suggesting we go as far introducing black puddings immediately. A phased withdrawal of the cricket bat will cause less fuss.” But what would you call The Hundred? Bloody Eck?

6d ago 21.54 GMT 2nd over: West Indies 20-0 (King 3, Charles 13) Johnson Charles was playher of the match when West Indies beat England at the T20 World Cup 11 years ago. Charles walloped 84 off 56 balls that day, and he looks like he fancies something similar here. He pulls Woakes for a big six, albeit with a hint of top-edge, and glides a boundary past short third man. West Indies are off to a flyer.



6d ago 21.49 GMT 1st over: West Indies 7-0 (King 1, Charles 2) There’s some early inswing to the right-handers for Reece Topley. Brandon King survives an LBW appeal first ball – it was missing leg – before another inswinger to Johnson Charles runs away for four leg-byes. Every boundary hurts when the target is so low, even in the first over.



6d ago 21.45 GMT After a very short break, the players are back on the field.



6d ago 21.39 GMT The difference two days make Tuesday, Tarouba England 267-3, 19 sixes

Thursday, Taroura England 132 all out, five sixes

Updated at 21.45 GMT

6d ago 21.36 GMT WICKET! England 132 all out (Curran c Rutherford b Holder 12) Sam Curran clouts the next ball to long-off to end an increasingly miserable England innings. They were 109 for four after 14 overs, and then the house fell down. West Indies need 133 to win the series.

Updated at 21.38 GMT

6d ago 21.33 GMT WICKET! England 132-9 (Rashid run out 1) Adil Rashid sacrifices himself, just like in the 2019 World Cup final, so that Curran can stay on strike. Four balls remaining.



6d ago 21.31 GMT 19th over: England 129-8 (Curran 9, Rashid 1) The hat-trick ball is another attempted yorker that Rashid flicks wide of Russell for a single. He would have had three wickets in four balls had Hosein taken a tricky low chance at third man to dismiss Curran. Russell, who bowled really well, finishes with two for 25.

sports,CBS Sports Staff,2023-10-13T21:17:17+00:00,"Kentucky sports betting has thrived since retail and online sportsbooks launched in September 2023. The governor has announced that roughly one month since the launch, upwards of $250 million has been wagered and that roughly 500,000 mobile accounts have been created for online sportsbooks. Since there are no restrictions on which sports can be wagered on or what kind of prop bets can be placed unlike restrictions on residents in other states, anyone using Kentucky sports betting sites can place bets on everything from football to college basketball games.

One factor that makes Kentucky sports betting such a success is that there is a wide variety of sportsbook apps to choose from if you want to place a wager from the comfort of your own home.

On March 31, 2023, Kentucky became the 34th state to legalize sports betting and the 25th with online/mobile access. Retail locations opened on September 7 and Kentucky online sports betting became legal on September 28.

The betting menu for Kentuckians is exhaustive in that they are able to legally wager on all major professional, collegiate and international sports, unlike other sports betting states. With excitement building among customers in the state for Kentucky sports gambling, it's feasible that Kentucky generates over $1 billion in Kentucky sports betting handle by the end of 2023.

Sports Betting on Kentucky (and Nearby) Teams

Kentucky Wildcats: One of the most iconic college basketball programs in the nation, the Kentucky Wildcats should be an extremely popular betting option for Bluegrass State residents. The eight-time national champions have been led by legendary coach John Calipari since 2010 and they have appeared in four Final Fours during his tenure, recording a national title in 2012. The program's 2,021-637 all-time record is the best in college basketball history. Though best known for its basketball prowess, Kentucky has also found more success on the gridiron in recent years in the SEC, including a dozen bowl appearances since 2006.

Louisville Cardinals: The Wildcats have the historic edge, but Louisville basketball won the more recent national title, cutting down the nets in 2013. They've been to 10 Final Fours and own the 12th-best record (1,726-874) in college basketball history. Louisville has also become a bigger name in the college football world in the past couple decades. Well known for 2013 Heisman winner Lamar Jackson, Louisville transitioned to the ACC in 2014 and the Cardinals have finished in the AP Top 25 seven times since 2004.

Western Kentucky Hilltoppers: Though they don't have the widespread following of UK or Louisville, the Hilltoppers have a nice fanbase in the southern portion of the state and they have the overall athletic success to demand attention in the betting market. A longtime Division I-AA (now known as FCS) power, WKU fully transitioned to the FBS level in 2009 and they've had nine winning seasons since that point. In men's basketball, WKU has made the NCAA Tournament 23 times and its 1,622-720 all-time mark ranks 14th in history, just a couple spots behind Louisville.

Cincinnati Bengals: With no ""Big Four"" professional sports teams playing within state lines, many Kentucky residents look just north of the state's border to cheer on the neighboring Cincinnati Bengals. A franchise long known for its futility in the early days of existence became more of a contender under Marvin Lewis with seven playoff appearances between 2005-15. The franchise got another jolt more recently with stars such as Joe Burrow and Ja'Marr Chase leading Cincinnati to a Super Bowl appearance in 2021 and an AFC title game appearance in 2022. The Indianapolis Colts and Tennessee Titans are also NFL franchises located within short drives of portions of Kentucky.

Cincinnati Reds: The state's MLB allegiances are a bit more split with the St. Louis Cardinals also drawing a big following, particularly in the western portion of the state, but the Reds are largely considered the most popular team for Kentucky residents. The Reds won modern-era titles in 1975, 1976 and 1990, but haven't advanced past the NLCS since that point. They've largely struggled in recent years, but the 2023 team has pushed for a playoff spot all season, just in time to draw the attention of new Kentucky sports bettors.

Top Kentucky betting terms for new bettors

Against the spread: Instead of betting on an exact winner, the widely-popular spread bet levels the playing field by allowing you to wager on how many points a team will win by. In basketball, if Kentucky is the 7.5-point favorite against Louisville then Kentucky can cover the spread if it wins by 8 or more points. However, Louisville as the 7.5-point underdog can cover the spread by winning outright or losing by 7 or fewer points.

Money line: Think of this as an elevated outright bet, with odds adjusted to reflect a favored team and an underdog. If Kentucky is listed as a -200 favorite against Florida, you'd need to bet $200 to return $100 on Kentucky to win. That means that Florida as the +200 underdog would return $200 on a $100 bet if that team wins.

Outright bet: This is the easiest wager that can be placed, and it's perfect for betting on one of Kentucky's biggest sporting events: Horse racing. With an outright bet, bettors choose one athlete -- or thoroughbred -- to win an entire sporting event.

Over/Under: If team sports is more your thing, placing an Over/Under bet is the way to go. Kentucky sportsbooks will post an estimated total of both team's final scores in a game, and you wager on whether the actual final will be higher or lower than the estimate. So if the If the Over/Under for a Kentucky vs. Louisville basketball game is 125.5, you would wager on the final total being Over 126 or Under 125.

Player prop: Kentucky is one of the 18 states that allows you to place prop bets on collegiate athletes. Sportsbooks will project what a player's stat will be at the end of a game, and you will wager whether the player will end that game over or under that projection. Popular player props include how many touchdown passes a quarterback will throw or how many three-point shots a basketball player will hit.

Underdog: The underdog is the team deemed less likely to win the game based on the odds. A bet on an underdog typically yields a larger return than a bet on the favorite.

Favorite: On the other hand, a favorite is the team that is deemed more likely to win the game. Bettors often pay a premium for betting on a favorite but they're also the team that more often wins the game outright.

Consensus odds: These odds are generally defined as an average of all available betting markets. Different sportsbooks may price markets variably based on the action they've taken or their own interpretation of information.

Futures: While money line, against the spread and over/under bets are all single-game bets, futures markets encompass almost anything that falls outside of that spectrum. Futures bets include total regular-season wins, championship odds, MVP odds and more.

Parlay: This popular betting style is a little more complex. A parlay requires you to include two or more bets within a single wager, and all of your bets must win for the parlay to be a winner. For example, if you wager $100 on a three-leg parlay at 6 to 1 odds, you could win $600 if all three legs of the bet are winners.

Juice: Also known as ""The Vig"" or vigorish, juice is effectively the tax that oddsmakers charge for handling a wager. If a book determines a game is a virtual coinflip, they may price both options at -110 to give themselves a 10% rake on all the action.

Push: A push is a bet where neither the bettor or the sportsbook wins. If an over/under for total points in a football game is set at 44 and both teams combine to score exactly 44 points, the result is a push and the principle is returned to the bettor.

Live/in-game betting: Many sportsbooks now offer live/in-game wagering that allows you to make bets on several different markets in real-time. In basketball, you can bet on the outcome of a quarter, individual statistics and live-updated spreads/totals.

You can bet on sports in states like Ohio, New York, and Arizona.","2023 Kentucky online sports betting sites: Best legal sportsbooks, promos, bonuses, mobile apps, how to bet",https://www.cbssports.com/general/news/2023-kentucky-online-sports-betting-sites-best-legal-sportsbooks-promos-bonuses-mobile-apps-how-to-bet/,CBSSports.com

Cons

You can’t just withdraw the Bonus Bets, but you have to wager them

What can I win with the FanDuel Sportsbook welcome offer?

With the FanDuel offer, whatever you win with your Bonus Bets is yours to keep. If you can make some successful bets, that should mean a nice profit given the fact that with the prelive offer you received $100 Bonus Bets for free, and with the welcome offer you only have to make a $5 bet up front in order to receive the $200 in Bonus Bets.

What makes the FanDuel Sportsbook welcome offer special?

The FanDuel Sportsbook offer is great for many reasons. It is simple and easy to claim and use.

And with the $100 in Bonus Bets for those signing up by Jan. 10, the offer is even more generous.

DraftKings Vermont promo code

DraftKings is likewise already known to Vermont sports fans thanks to its popular DFS site, and many will surely be gravitating to the DraftKings Sportsbook as well. DraftKings also has a prelive offer already available to Vermont users. Be aware, though, that those who accept the prelive offer will not be eligible for DraftKings' welcome offer later on.

If you use our links and sign up for a DraftKings Sportsbook VT account between now and the moment the site goes live on Jan. 11, you will receive $200 in Bonus Bets, issued as eight $25 Bonus Bets.

You also don’t have to worry about winning or losing your first wager to get a bonus as with other sites’ offers

Cons

You only receive winnings and not the bet amounts when you use Bonus Bets

BetMGM Vermont promo code

Known as the “King of Sportsbooks,” BetMGM Sportbook is another favorite around the US and will surely be one should it launch in Vermont. BetMGM has applied for an online sports betting license and should be one of the new sites in VT.

Fanatics Sportsbook has also taken advantage of the company’s other major business as an official sports apparel and gear provider that partners with all the major leagues and teams. Drawing on that connection, Fanatics has sometimes made a free jersey, or, rather, money to spend in the Fanatics Store, part of a welcome offer to new users.

We'll stay tuned to see what happens with Fanatics Sportsbook VT.

ESPN Bet Vermont promo code

ESPN Bet Sportsbook has also applied to operate an online sportsbook in Vermont, and so it could soon be among the new online wagering options for Vermont bettors as well.

ESPN Bet brings a very familiar brand to sports fans, but a relatively new one when it comes to online sports betting. After acquiring the old Barstool Sportsbook earlier in the year, ESPN Bet Sportsbook launched the rebranded site in 17 different states in Nov. 2023. The site has already begun taking advantage of various tie-ins with the renowned sports programming network which has helped in the effort to establish the site in the overall marketplace.

In other states, the ESPN Bet welcome offer has included a 100% deposit match bonus worth up to $1,000 (with a 20x wagering requirement). ESPN Bet has also run a welcome promo that invites new sign-ups to place a wager of any amount and receive $200 in Bonus Bets split into four $50 Bonus Bets.

Again, we'll keep an eye out for any news regarding ESPN Bet Sportsbook VT.

sports,Bill Bender,2023-11-11T22:50:13+00:00,"The Big Ten announced Michigan coach Jim Harbaugh will be prohibited from coaching on the sideline for the remainder of the regular season.

At least, in theory. The Friday ruling is the next chapter in an NCAA investigation into Michigan for in-person scouting and sign stealing in a scandal that led to the resignation of staffer Connor Stallions on Nov. 3. Harbaugh will be allowed to coach during the week but will not be able to be on the sideline. Michigan did not get a ruling on a temporary restraining order ahead of the showdown against No. 10 Penn State.

The Wolverines still won 24-15 under interim coach Sherrone Moore, but the fallout from the scandal continues to have a far-reaching impact on the Big Ten, Michigan and college football beyond this year's College Football Playoff race.

A look at the winners and losers from the scandal to date:

Michigan scandal winners and losers

Winners

Tony Petitti

Petitti certainly did not hit Michigan with a ""slap on the wrist."" That ruling showed Petitti is not afraid to take on one of the Big Two within the conference. In a letter to Michigan, Petitti tried to dispel those notions. Via The Athletic's Nicole Auerbach:

“The Conference does not play favorites among its members, nor does it take actions towards its members based on prejudgment or bias. Failing to act under the extraordinary circumstances here could lead other Conference members to reasonably conclude that the conference has chosen to favor the University over all other members.”

Tony Petitti, in letter to Michigan, says that the school initially refused to consent to the Big Ten obtaining the spreadsheet and other documents from the NCAA related to its investigation.



Also makes point to say he's not playing favorites. pic.twitter.com/OgTvTNY1QI — Nicole Auerbach (@NicoleAuerbach) November 10, 2023

Most speculation pinned a potential Harbaugh suspension at two games knowing that the regular-season finale against No. 1 Ohio State is a huge television draw and Petitti has a background in TV with the MLB Network. Petitti went heavy-handed instead, maybe a little too heavy considering the pending legal response from Michigan.

This no doubt is risky on several fronts. The Big Ten made it clear that they still have not linked Harbaugh to any wrongdoing and that this an institutional penalty based on the findings. The NCAA also will continue its investigation into the Wolverines. The timing of Friday's announcement also was poor – less than 24 hours before the game against Penn State. Petitti upheld sportsmanship within the conference, but it could lead to a long-term rift with Michigan.

Regardless, Petitti did the right thing.

DECOURCY: Michigan got off easy with Harbaugh suspension

Ohio State-Michigan TV ratings

With or without Harbaugh, The Game will draw ridiculous television ratings.

According to Sports Media Watch, three college football games have drew a Nielsen rating of 5.0 or better this season. Penn State-Ohio State (5.3), Colorado-Oregon (5.2) and Ohio State-Notre Dame (5.1) make up that list. Michigan-Penn State should join that list on Saturday, but the intrigue around The Game this year could double all of those games.

Last year's matchup drew an 8.05 with 17.1 million viewers. Michigan won the last two meetings and has a chance to win three in a row in the rivalry for the first time since 1995-97. Ohio State is No. 1 in the College Football Playoff rankings. Harbaugh (2-5) and Day (1-2) both have losing records in this rivalry matchup, and the Big Ten East, CFP and perhaps national championship are on the line.

Will this game draw a 10 Nielsen rating and 20 million viewers? It's not out of the question, and there will be enough WWE-like promos leading up to this game to get both fan-bases frothing.

Helmet technology

CBSSports.com reported on Oct. 20 that the NCAA rules committee is giving teams the option of coach-to-player helmet communication to relay plays from the sideline during bowl season this year. Tablets will inevitably follow, and here is the sliver of good that will come from this scandal.

It's about damn time. Death to sandwich-board playcalling, please. Bring on those playsheets where coaches simply have to cover their mouth. This is one instance where emulating the NFL game is overdue.

Sherrone Moore

If Moore is going to be a head coach, then Saturday’s victory against the Nittany Lions was a fitting audition. The Wolverines rushed for 227 yards – including 32 straight run plays – in grinding out a top-10 victory at one of the toughest environments in the FBS at Beaver Stadium.

Moore was emotional - complete with NSFW language – in the aftermath.

Sherrone Moore filled in for Jim Harbaugh as Michigan's coach today.



He was emotional after defeating Penn State.



""I want to thank Coach Harbaugh. ... I love the s— out of you man.""



🎥: @CFBONFOX pic.twitter.com/NmXZWrGxCM — The Sporting News (@sportingnews) November 11, 2023

Moore, however, will emerge as a leading candidate for some jobs as a result, and that is a huge victory for one of the nation’s top assistants.

Losers

Connor Stalions

Stalions made a name for himself. He will be remembered as the Michigan staffer as the center of this sign-stealing scandal. Stalions resigned on Nov. 3. The NCAA investigation whether Michigan was involved with in-person scouting, which is prohibited by the NCAA, put Stalions into the college football consciousness. According to ESPN.com, Stalions allegedly purchased tickets to more than 35 games involving Big Ten and potential CFP opponents.

Photos also surfaced os a person who resembles Stalions on the Central Michigan sideline during the Chippewas' opener against Michigan State on Sept. 1. Central Michigan has yet to confirm who that person was, another layer to a wild Stalions story that has supplied endless meme and conspiracy material on social media.

Stalions might be the fall guy who saved Michigan from further wrath from the Big Ten and NCAA or the reason the Wolverines' national championship season unraveled. That fate is yet to be determined, but at minimum he will be one of those controversial names we'll never forget, like Harvey Updyke and Nevin Shapiro.

Jim Harbaugh

On one hand, Harbaugh could serve his second suspension within one season and further NCAA punishment could be coming down the line. On the other, he could emerge as a martyr for Michigan fans given there is reportedly no proof yet he knew of Stalion's rule-breaking.

Harbaugh will have a temporary restraining order hearing on Nov. 17, according to ESPN.com. That will determine whether he returns to the field for the final two games against Maryland and No. 1 Ohio State.

It's an inescapable fact that Harbaugh is 31-3 – and Michigan is 35-3 – since the program bottomed out at the end of the 2020 season. While it is almost impossible to quantify how much the alleged in-person scouting and sign-stealing would have helped the Wolverines over the past two seasons, it will be a tough stain to erase knowing those violations are now on the Big Ten record.

What will Harbaugh do now? That is almost impossible to predict given his combative personality. Would he sign a contract extension and continue to fight the NCAA? Will Harbaugh finally take the parachute to the NFL? Those are questions bound to come up at the end of the 2023 season.

BENDER: Michigan will need Jim Harbaugh against Ohio State

Big Ten

This is the fourth football scandal in less than a calendar year.

Three former Iowa football players and a student manager were charged in an illegal sports wagering scandal. Several student-athletes face allegations of placing bets on games in which they played in. Northwestern coach Pat Fitzgerald was fired on July 10 after a hazing investigation into the program. Fitzgerald is suing the university for wrongful termination. Michigan State fired Mel Tucker on Sept. 27 after allegations of sexual misconduct from Brenda Tracy, a speaker on sexual assault awareness.

Now, Michigan has a scandal on the field, and they countered with allegations that Ohio State and Rutgers leaked Michigan's signs to Purdue in last year's Big Ten championship game. ESPN reported that Big Ten coaches and athletic directors encouraged Big Ten commissioner Petitti to act last week, but that resulted in action before the NCAA investigation concluded.

Do you wonder what the SEC and commissioner Greg Sankey privately think about all this? For the Big Ten, it is an ugly run of bad behavior on and off the field for a conference that is welcoming four new members next season in Oregon, UCLA, USC and Washington.

To be determined

Michigan

Michigan is 10-0 and on track to meet No. 1 Ohio State for another blockbuster matchup in college football’s best rivalry. On the field, the Wolverines remain on track for a third straight Big Ten championship and shot at the College Football Playoff.

But this is about more than football.

Will more penalties come from the Big Ten and NCAA as a result of the in-person scouting scandal that has not left the college football consciousness this month? Will the Harbaugh-Petitti battle lead to an unsettling end for Michigan? President Santa Ono and athletic director Warde Manuel have voiced their support for Harbaugh, but that has been more about due process than admitting to any wrongdoing.

It has thrust the Wolverines – a talented team led by J.J. McCarthy, Blake Corum and a defense that allows 7.5 points per game – into a villain role, complete with visits from Ric Flair. That only works when you are winning. One loss, and all this could unravel, and the Terps and Buckeyes still remain on the schedule.

Will a national championship outweigh the stain on their reputation? The answer is almost always yes for the fans, but the program might feel a different long-term result.","Michigan sign-stealing scandal winners and losers, from Jim Harbaugh to Tony Petitti",https://www.sportingnews.com/us/ncaa-football/news/michigan-scandal-winners-losers-jim-harbaugh-tony-petitti/52ad1c9ec667b556323fa41c,Sporting News
sports,Edward Sutelan,2023-12-17T23:06:30+00:00,"The Bears' prayers were nearly answered on a game-ending Hail Mary. Instead, Cleveland fans exhaled as their team came away with an improbable win against Chicago.

Justin Fields and the Bears had the ball at the Cleveland 45 trailing by three with five seconds left on the clock. There was no time for a play and a field goal without any timeouts to try for a shorter kick.

Chicago's only hope of winning the game — and keeping its surging playoff trending up — would rest on a Hail Mary, a play so dubbed because it takes a miracle to succeed.

The Bears nearly had their miracle. The ball had the distance and it was tipped in the air several times and began to fall into the arms of Bears receiver Darnell Mooney, who was falling toward the endzone turf. He had his hands on it as it began to fall into his chest.

The ball deflected off his hands and legs and ultimately into the waiting hands of safety D'Anthony Bell, who made the catch and slid to the ground to end the game and seal the Browns' 20-17 win.

""It would've been crazy,"" Mooney said after the game. ""I mean, how many times you see a Hail Mary work and actually fall into, being able to make the catch? It's tough. I wish I could've had it, but I mean it is what it is.""

The balance of the game was suspended in the air as the ball deflected from Bear to Brown. Cleveland tight end David Njoku had the same reaction as likely just about any fan watching the game in the stands or at home.

""I damn near s— myself, dog,"" Njoku said, per The Athletic's Zac Jackson.

The Bears' sideline appeared convinced it had won. Fields said that as the ball began to fall into Mooney's hands, the Chicago sideline began to erupt before realizing the ball would not be ending in Bears' hands.

Fields' counterpart, Joe Flacco, could only watch on the jumbotron as the play unfolded. He had just driven the Browns to the go-ahead score the drive before. In his 16 years in the NFL, he's seen a lot, and he knew to hold off on any celebration until the game was official.

""When you watch and or are a part of all the games that go on every week, you know not to get excited until that clock hits zero,"" Flacco said. ""There's so many things that can happen, whether we've been a part of it or whether like I said you've seen it on Sundays just watching TV so believe me I was over there and guys want to come up and congratulate and things like that and I'm just sitting there waiting for that clock to hit zero.""

MORE: Updated NFL playoff picture in Week 15

Browns edge rusher Myles Garrett was on the field as one of the few players at the line of scrimmage, focusing more on pressuring Fields than picking him off. And when Fields got the throw off, he, too, became a spectator.

""Shoot, too good of a view,"" Garrett said. ""He kinda looked at me just made sure I was far enough and then tossed it up and I was like, 'Please, Lord, don't let us be on one of these YouTube compilations.'""

It had been a wild ending to the game. Chicago had led 17-7 heading into the fourth quarter, but on successive drives, the Browns scored a field goal to open the fourth quarter, scored a game-tying touchdown with 3:08 left in the contest. Cleveland forced a three-and-out, then drove down the field in eight plays to kick a go-ahead field goal with 32 seconds left, burning all of Chicago's timeouts in the process.

The Bears got a bit of life when Tyler Scott caught a short pass from Fields and raced up the right sideline 30 yards to move up to Cleveland's 45. But after back-to-back incompletions, the Bears were forced to try for the Hail Mary rather than kick the long field goal.

""At the end of the game, I loved the way our guys battled at the end,"" Bears coach Matt Eberflus said. ""And what a nice play by T Scott to put us in position and, again, we were just too far back. We ended up throwing the Hail Mary at the end and we had a chance there too, that's just about focus and concentration at the very end and making a really good play.""

Chicago had plenty of other issues that contributed to coming up short to the Browns. The Bears' only touchdowns came when an interception spotted Chicago at the Browns' 1-yard line and another on a pick-six. The offense went three-and-out eight times. And rather than try for a go-ahead, 54-yard field goal, the Bears opted for a Hail Mary from the Browns' 37 with no time left in the first half, leading to Fields' first interception. The only two Chicago turnovers came on Fields' Hail Mary tries.

The loss was also particularly crushing for a team that had won back-to-back games, with a pair of wild-card contenders in the Vikings and Packers losing this weekend. But dropping to 5-9 is a crushing blow to Chicago's playoff hopes and solidifies it will be another season of a sub-.500 record in the Windy City.","Browns survive Bears Hail Mary on wild, near-catch by Darnell Mooney: 'Damn near s— myself'",https://www.sportingnews.com/us/nfl/news/bears-hail-mary-darnell-mooney-browns/ee147cccbf7ad4ae91ce0ea1,Sporting News
sports,Mintu Tomar,2023-11-01T21:00:28+00:00,"With the recent release of Marvel’s Spider-Man 2, Insomniac has witnessed a huge appreciation from fans for delivering a memorable sequel. Not to mention the epic portrayal of Peter Parker and Miles Morales fighting against some of the strongest villains. But then, there’s MJ as well who has made a comeback from the first installment. And it’s her arc that has actually received an impressive elevation this time. Especially when considering the poorly received missions featuring Mary Jane in the original game from 2018.

America’s Favorite Video Today

So what’s actually changed in 2023 that has created a vast difference? There are certain key reasons making Mary Jane in Spider-Man 2 a treat to watch. Not just from the perspective of her relationship with Peter, but her own missions showcasing a different side this time. One can even call her the third unofficial superhero in the latest PS5 exclusive.

A refreshing take on Mary Jane’s stealth missions makes her a strong character in Marvel’s Spider-Man 2

ADVERTISEMENT Article continues below this ad

In the first title, stepping into MJ’s shoes was a great concept, but the devs somehow couldn’t execute the plan flawlessly. As a result, missions featuring her as a playable character were heavily criticized by most of the fans. There was nothing too special about those quests whatsoever.

Now, looking at Mary Jane in Marvel’s Spider-Man 2, there’s a very clear difference one can make out. In short, it feels comparing night and day. Being a journalist at The Daily Bugle, her character is bound to go places in order to investigate mysteries. The first game had such situations, but the sequel improved on them. It gives MJ a lot more strength instead of being someone who always needs to be rescued in the last moment. But how?

Compared to the lack of interactivity in 2018’s Spider-Man, MJ is now capable of tackling the enemies around her. In the first title, all she could do was to move from one point to the other. Now, she’s able to do more than that – make pretty good and lethal moves. To be precise, the devs have given MJ a little firepower, if not in too much capacity. Now, she’s got weapons instead of being clueless in moments of being vulnerable against armed enemies. Yes, she hasn’t got any superpowers, but she’s got other means to help herself out.

Due to such involvement, players have now got a reason to be more invested into a given mission focusing on MJ. It wasn’t the case at all taking into consideration her previous iteration in Insomniac’s original game. Mary Jane can now handle the circumstances in her own manner, thus breaking free from the linear approach of just trying to hide and escape.

MJ in Spider-Man 2 vs. MJ from Insomniac’s 2018 installment

While there are similarities between the character’s iterations in two titles, a lot of drastic differences are also present. Speaking of similar aspects, the first game had a mission where Mary gets to use a taser to shock the guards. Well there’s no taser in Spider-Man 2, she’s got a stun gun now.

Then, there are moments of hiding and sneaking past the enemies. In the original game, there were missions like the one in Grand Central Station where MJ had to stay hidden from a number of Mr. Negative’s demons to defuse a bomb. Similarly, in Spider-Man 2, MJ is seen hiding from the hunters during the ‘Wake Up’ quest. But what’s actually changed?

Well, the very difference lies in the lack of MJ’s abilities in the first game and how she’s evolved in the second. Coming back to the ‘Wake Up’ mission, she’s seen sneaking past the hunters but she’s also capable of performing Takedowns on them. It wasn’t the case in the previous title. Her missions have become better now with the devs actually spending time on giving her a chance to fight.

Coming back to the stun gun part, MJ is pretty skilled in using it, during missions like ‘Good Men’, thanks to her training with Sable. Also, now she’s got the option to even run away and hide when spotted by enemies. The playability factor around her has increased a lot compared to being just an observer, for the most part, in the first game. That’s the biggest and most visible difference.

Mary Jane and her missions in Spider-Man 2 allow the story to proceed without causing a problem for the central protagonists

The best thing about going through the quests showcasing Mary Jane is that they never try to overpower the ongoing story itself. The game’s narrative remains intact, no matter what. There never occurs a feeling of the devs trying too hard to make it seem like her missions are stretching out of their boundaries.

Although they are designed well this time but one has to commend Insomniac’s team to keep a limit on not making MJ’s gameplay moments seem forced or going beyond a certain point. They serve their purpose without affecting the main plot of Marvel’s Spider-Man 2 or overlapping with Peter or Miles’ stories. In a way, each character has been given a good amount of time to shine. At times, it may feel like MJ’s playable sequences should have been extended. But it’s nice to see that the devs decided to not do that; sometimes less is more and fine.

Despite Spider-Man 2 being more of a Peter’s story (in its entirety), MJ’s role has been given equal significance too. There’s a visible growth in her arc especially considering her profession as a journalist. Yes, she’s Peter’s love interest, but that’s not everything she’s there for. Players can easily see it happening throughout the game’s duration.

The verdict?

ADVERTISEMENT Article continues below this ad

It’s obvious to expect that a lot of fans who didn’t like MJ’s missions in the first installment won’t like her this time as well. But considering how she was before and how she’s in Spider-Man 2, the overall change is quite praiseworthy. Things are different this time, thankfully.

MJ’s missions are now having some actual meaning attached to them rather than acting like fillers. Players who want to have a few interesting moments aside from the main quests featuring Miles and Peter can have a sense of finishing well-designed stealth quests. Mary’s gameplay missions end up increasing the overall quality of Spider-Man 2. All things considered, it is great to see Insomniac improving on this aspect instead of removing it completely.

sports,Kyle Bonn,2023-10-07T21:30:00+00:00,"Inter Miami were in simply too big of a hole in the MLS playoff race, one which even Lionel Messi couldn’t drag them out of.

With two matches remaining in the season, Inter Miami have been officially eliminated from the MLS playoff race, with Supporters’ Shield winners FC Cincinnati dealing the deathblow with a 1-0 victory at DRV PNK Stadium.

The match had every hallmark of what made Inter Miami a flawed side when Lionel Messi arrived. Inter Miami utterly dominated the first half, but could not find the breakthrough, instead hitting the woodwork three separate times in the opening half-hour and four overall in the match. On the other end, Drake Callender was nothing short of sensational in goal, but even his heroics were just not enough to stymie the electric counter-attack that FC Cincinnati possess.

Messi, who had missed the last four games due to injury, returned to play 35 minutes off the bench, but by the time he stepped on the pitch, Inter Miami’s early dominance in the match had come and gone. Messi played a part, but he was unable to fully change the tide of the game.

Eventually, Alvaro Barreal’s 78th-minute goal ended any hope that Inter Miami had to complete a stunning playoff charge, and the defeat coupled with CF Montreal’s big 4-1 victory over Portland means Inter Miami are officially out of the postseason running.

The Sporting News followed the Inter Miami vs. FC Cincinnati match live, providing score updates, commentary and highlights as they happened.

Inter Miami vs FC Cincinnati live updates, highlights, commentary

FULLTIME: Inter Miami 0-1 FC Cincinnati

Inter Miami are made to rue their early missed chances, as Alvaro Barreal's 78th-minute goal is enough to secure victory for FC Cincinnati.

In the process, Inter Miami are officially OUT of the MLS playoff race, as tonight's defeat coupled with CF Montreal's 4-0 victory over Portland are enough to see them eliminated from contention.

Messi joined Inter Miami with the club bottom of the Eastern Conference, and the gap was just too big to overcome. Messi's injury certainly played a role, but even so, there was just not enough room for error.

Inter Miami vs FC Cincinnati: Second Half

90+3 min: With five minutes of added time on the board, Lionel Messi draws another foul in a very dangerous position, this one much more obvious for the official to make. It's just outside the penalty area from a central position, and Messi stands over it yet again.

His effort on goal is close to finding the top-left corner, but it's just high, clipping off the very top of the crossbar. Officially the fourth time they've hit the woodwork, although this one wasn't quite as dramatic.

89th min: Lionel Messi draws a very contentious foul by Yuya Kubo whose tackle from behind looked clean but draws a whistle regardless. Messi's delivery from a deep central position is floated in and headed out by Matt Miazga for a corner.

The ensuing set-piece is played short and eventually comes to Messi whose deep delivery is seeking the far corner but nervously tapped wide by Roman Celentano. Eventually, a foul by Messi ends the chance and leaves Santiago Arias rolling around on the ground.

88th min: Two more changes for FC Cincinnati as Dominique Badji enters for Luciano Acosta, whose night is done a few minutes early despite trailing by a goal in the Golden Boot race. Malik Pinto also comes on for Brandon Vazquez.

Teammates Acosta and Aaron Boupendza are jawing at each other as the change is made, which might be an alarming sign for FC Cincinnati with the playoffs on the horizon.

84th min: Roman Celentano absorbs a yellow card for time wasting as he stands over a goal kick, much to the delight of the home crowd.

79th min: GOAL! FC CINCINNATI! Drake Callender makes another sensational save, but this time he can't keep Inter Miami level! Callender parries Yuya Kubo's initial effort, but he drives it right into the path of Alvaro Barreal, and he buries the follow-up low into the far corner, and now Inter Miami are in very hot water!

CF Montreal are leading the Portland Timbers 3-0, and therefore Inter Miami must win or they are officially OUT of the playoff race!

76th min: Two more changes for Inter Miami, as Josef Martinez is curiously withdrawn, replaced by Nick Stefanelli. Robert Taylor also enters for DeAndre Yedlin. They have to win to stay alive in the MLS playoff race.

67th min: Chance, FC Cincinnati! ANOTHER BONKERS SAVE BY DRAKE CALLENDER! HE'S UNBEATABLE TONIGHT! Aaron Boupendza crosses to Brandon Vazquez on the counter, and while the latter is clean through on goal, Callender comes across his goal to make a sensational stop!

The flag goes up, meaning it won't count as a save, but the replay looked incredibly close, so Callender's stop means that VAR does not have a chance to intervene.

65th min: Chance, FC Cincinnati! Inter Miami have hit the post three times, but now it's FC Cincinnati who have struck the woodwork! Brandon Vazquez gets his head to a corner but it comes off the post.

64th min: Inter Miami have to remain wary of the vicious FC Cincinnati counter-attack, and here a lovely Luciano Acosta switch laterally across the top of the penalty area finds Alvaro Barreal in space, but his hit is blocked.

Pat Noonan makes his second change of the match, bringing Yuya Kubo on for Junior Moreno in midfield.

58th min: Lionel Messi's influence has been immediate, and he earns a dangerous free-kick just outside the penalty area, well within his range. Messi appears to be struggling to get good footing on this field, but it's the shirt pull from Miazga which brings him down.

Messi takes it but puts it way over the crossbar. A bit rusty?

57th min: Jean Mota has a shot from distance, and it looks to be a vicious knuckler with some dip, but it goes just wide.

55th min: HERE COMES LIONEL MESSI! He will enter with around 35 minutes to save Inter Miami's season, replacing Tomas Aviles in a very attacking change. Jean Mota also comes on to replace David Ruiz, which is harsh as the young midfielder had been very good.

50th min: Chance, FC Cincinnati! DRAKE CALLENDER MAKES A MASSIVE DOUBLE SAVE! FC Cincinnati are RIGHT on the doorstep, but he comes up huge twice! Aaron Boupendza is the most aggrieved, as his follow-up came from directly in front of the goal but he was stymied by Callender's outstretched right foot!

47th min: Luciano Acosta is fouled on the edge of the attacking third, and it gives FC Cincinnati a free-kick early in the second half. Alvaro Barreal's delivery is floated way high in the air and falls to the far post, but after a nervy moment it's cleared.

Lionel Messi begins to warm up on the touchline, and he may be brought on soon to help Inter Miami save their postseason chances.

Kickoff: The second half is underway, and there are no changes from Inter Miami, which means Lionel Messi remains on the bench for now. With their playoff hopes now squarely on the line, it's a huge call from Gerardo Martino not to bring Messi on now, and it could speak to how fit he truly is.

FC Cincinnati make one change, as Sergio Santos comes off, replaced by Aaron Boupendza up front.

HALFTIME: Inter Miami 0-0 FC Cincinnati

Needing victory in this match to ensure they remain in the MLS playoff picture, Inter Miami completely dominated the confirmed 2023 regular season champs but somehow did not manage to capitalize on their overwhelming pressure. Inter Miami were so unlucky not to cash in on multiple occasions, hitting the woodwork an insane three times, all in the first 30 minutes. Lionel Messi may yet have a job to do tonight, currently available off the bench.

FC Cincinnati had one really good look that they missed as well but otherwise were on their heels the entire 45 minutes. Head coach Pat Noonan tells the broadcast he feels FC Cincinnati had ""a lack of courage on the ball"" that half, ""as bad as its been all year.""

Elsewhere, Inter Miami will be nervous about other results from around the league. Most painful is the 2-0 lead for CF Montreal over Portland, which would be a big blow to Inter Miami, meaning they would be eliminated with anything less than a win tonight.

Inter Miami vs FC Cincinnati: First Half

43rd min: There's a goal mouth scrap that sees Roman Celentano scrambling wildly on the doorstep as the ball bounces around awkwardly, but nobody can get on the end of it for Inter Miami.

38th min: While Inter Miami haven't generated any clear-cut chances since the Celentano save on the half-hour mark, they've remained in complete control of this match. The broadcast shows Lionel Messi on the bench, and he looks very antsy, like he wants to enter the game badly.

Some Inter Miami players are called off the touchline to warm up, but Messi isn't one of them.

30th min: Chance, Inter Miami! Facundo Farias forces Roman Celentano into a full-stretch save! A right-footed blast sees the FC Cincinnati goalkeeper make his first big stop. It's an utter siege from Inter Miami through the opening half-hour! Supporters' Shield winners FC Cincinnati have barely survived thus far!

28th min: Obinna Nwobodo is booked for a very late tackle on Facundo Farias in transition. He has to watch himself, as he gives the referee a sarcastic applause, which is a good way to draw the official's ire and get sent off.

26th min: Inter Miami have another good set-piece opportunity as the rain begins to fall hard at Inter Miami. It's really coming down in South Florida, and more could be on the way. Sergio Busquets takes it and blasts it straight into the wall.

24th min: Chance, Inter Miami! THEY'VE HIT THE WOODWORK AGAIN! Benja Cremaschi is fed through on a one-two with Josef Martinez, and with the outside of his right foot, he bends it around Matt Miazga but clatters the near post. The THIRD time Inter Miami have hit the bar in under a half-hour! How unlucky??

22nd min: Chance, Inter Miami! Inter Miami hit the woodwork again! Josef Martinez, who has been electric so far, rips a shot from a tight angle about 15 yards out, and while it beats Roman Celentano, it also clatters the far post and deflects out! So close again for the hosts!

22' | Josef takes a chance and it hits the post🤯#MIAvCIN | 0-0 pic.twitter.com/BbD0dWKnzP — Inter Miami CF (@InterMiamiCF) October 8, 2023

20th min: Josef Martinez's hold-up play creates a chance for a charging Benja Cremaschi, but he puts his driven effort wide.

14th min: Inter Miami have a very dangerous free-kick as Josef Martinez is bundled over from behind by Junior Moreno. The ball is shaded right of the middle just inches outside the penalty area, and it'll be Facundo Farias to take with his fellow Argentine Lionel Messi on the bench. The floated delivery find the head of a teammate, but the shot is weak and easily caught by Roman Celentano.

12th min: Chance, FC Cincinnati! WHAT A SAVE DRAKE CALLENDER! Cincinnati hit on the counter again, as Brandon Vazquez brilliantly settles a ball from deep and finds Sergio Santos. The Cincinnati forward is tackled by Tomas Aviles as he gets his shot off, and that may have put him off just enough to allow Callender to make a diving, full-stretch stop.

End-to-end stuff so far!

9th min: Chance, Inter Miami! Oh no, Tomas Aviles has missed with the goal gaping! On a corner, the initial header drops in Aviles's lap, and he produces a finish of real quality, whipping his leg horizontally at the bouncing ball up near his hip, but he crashes the shot off the crossbar! It had serious pace and should have bulged the net!

Chance, FC Cincinnati! Just seconds after Aviles hit the woodwork, FC Cincinnati counter with real venom, and Sergio Santos puts his chance wide! He's pressured while making a one-on-one run, and the delivery from the right flashes wide of the near post as he slides to meet it.

Both teams will believe they should be in front!

8th min: Inter Miami have held the attacking possession in the opening stage of the match, looking to break down FC Cincinnati early, but Matt Miazga holds firm before he's fouled as Josef Martinez undercuts him in the air.

3rd min: An early free-kick for Inter Miami from about 35 yards away shaded way right, and with Lionel Messi on the bench, Noah Allen stands over the ball. The play is off the training ground, as his delivery goes vertically to try and create a lateral cross opportunity for DeAndre Yedlin, but it's overcooked and completely wasted over the end line. Yikes.

Kickoff: The match is under way at DRV PNK Stadium! One club's status for the postseason is as assured as possible, while the other team's status is far from certain.

Inter Miami vs FC Cincinnati: Pre-match commentary, analysis, stats, and more

5 mins to kickoff: While there is no active protest happening from the Inter Miami supporter section, they are also taking more muted measures to make their feelings known. They have made a collective effort not to be their usual cheerful selves before kickoff, sitting quietly instead of waving flags and making noise.

With such a massive game on hand, this is a very clear sign of frustration with the enormous increase in ticket prices next season. Inter Miami's home field advantage tonight will be significantly hampered.

Not sure how much can be appreciated via the photo, but La Familia — Inter Miami’s supporters’ groups — are mostly sitting here before kickoff.

15 mins to kickoff: Interestingly, while tonight's match should kick off without any negative attention, it seems the club just managed to get off the ground without a hitch. According to Michelle Kaufman of the Miami Herald, the supporter groups had planned a protest regarding 2024 season ticket prices, but the club offered to meet with them this coming week so they called it off until that can take place.

A reminder, this match officially kicks off at 7:39 p.m. ET so there will be a slight delay from the advertised 7:30 p.m. time.

30 mins to kickoff: Lionel Messi's availability for Inter Miami is a welcome sight for the club, as they take the field today with their backs against the wall. Inter Miami must win tonight to ensure they remain alive in the playoff race. A draw or a loss, however, would see them vulnerable to outside results.

If Inter Miami do not win, two of the following three possible outcomes would trigger their elimination from playoff contention: CF Montreal beats Portland Timbers; NYCFC wins versus D.C. United; and Chicago Fire picks up points against Charlotte FC.

Those are all conceivable results, and therefore Inter Miami will wish to keep it in their own hands just a little longer. They'll eventually need other results to go their way to climb the table, but for now, their survival is solely up to them.

45 mins to kickoff: Lineups are in, and Lionel Messi is on the bench for Inter Miami.

For FC Cincinnati, Luciano Acosta starts despite the match being meaningless from a tangible standpoint, understandable considering he is chasing the Golden Boot. Ian Murphy comes in for Yerson Mosquera at the back, while Aaron Boupendza is rotated out up front with Brandon Vazquez and Sergio Santos starting together up front.

1 hour to kickoff: With lineups still yet to be released, let's take a look at one player who is, in fact, an MVP candidate for this year.

FC Cincinnati forward Luciano Acosta is one back of Denis Bouanga for the MLS goal scoring lead with two matches left, sitting on 16 for the year. With 13 assists alongside that, his 29 total goal contributions are best in the league, above the 27 of Thiago Almada and 25 of Hany Mukhtar. Acosta ranks as the second-highest rated player by WhoScored this season across all of Major League Soccer.

You wonder if he's going to be rested tonight with the Supporters' Shield and No. 1 seed locked up. It would be devastating for him to be injured in a meaningless game, regardless of the opponent.

""Luciano Acosta's the MVP... He's been an unbelievable player for us this year."" @fccincinnati goalkeeper @roman_413 had nothing but praise for @LuchoAcosta94 and Pat Noonan 🟠🔵 pic.twitter.com/Xyp2ozr7n5 — CBS Sports Golazo ⚽️ (@CBSSportsGolazo) October 3, 2023

1 hour 15 mins to kick: Lionel Messi was nominated for not only MLS Newcomer of the Year for the 2023 season, but also 2023 MLS MVP.

Laughable doesn't even begin to describe that blatant PR move, considering that most of the damage Messi has done for Inter Miami has come in Cup competitions. He has one goal and two assists in 247 minutes of play in actual MLS competition. Lionel Messi has been fun, but let's hope the league doesn't make a mockery of itself by actually giving Messi either honor.

1 hour 30 mins to kick: As if Inter Miami's predicament tonight wasn't difficult enough, requiring a victory to keep their playoff hopes alive, it will have to come against the best team in Major League Soccer through the 2023 regular season.

FC Cincinnati won the Supporters' Shield as the regular season champion, confirmed on Wednesday despite suffering defeat. It's been an exceptional season for the club, and they won't stop here just because they have nothing tangible left to gain over the final few matches.

1 hour 45 mins to kick: It's Fan Appreciation Night at DRV PNK Stadium, where they're giving out Inter Miami bucket hats to the first few fans through the gates.

That's nice and all, but the best way to appreciate the fans would be to not price out the loyal supporters from season tickets next year. Instead, Inter Miami has jacked 2024 membership rates to put the club amongst some of the most expensive tickets in not just MLS, but the world.

While there will certainly be folks who can afford those high-demand tickets, many of those individuals won't be the same fans who have supported the club from its inception in 2020. This means Inter Miami have chosen to secure maximum profit at the expense of its fanbase, and a high turnover amongst the regular in-person support from this season to next is likely.

2 hours to kickoff: A report from well-connected Argentine journalist Gaston Edul last night indicated that Inter Miami are likely to have Lionel Messi back for this match in some capacity. Edul reported that ""the idea is for Leo Messi to get minutes when Inter Miami plays FC Cincinnati"".

That makes it sound like Messi will only be available off the bench, but it's better than nothing to have a game-changer like him available at all.

Inter Miami vs FC Cincinnati lineups & team news

There was a report that Lionel Messi could finally make his return from injury, and while it felt unlikely that Messi would start three days after missing out entirely, he appears on the bench today and could be available for a second half appearance if required.

Jordi Alba remains sidelined with a hamstring injury, missing since his injury just minutes before Messi, and without a publicly known timeline for a return. Also missing is striker Leonardo Campana who was absent from the midweek defeat to the Chicago Fire with a muscle injury, although Gerardo Martino described his issue as ""minor.""

Important midfielder Gregore, who has missed most of the season with a foot injury, is back in training and should return to the field at some point, although when is not known. Defender Tomas Aviles is back from suspension and starts in the three center-back system.

Inter Miami starting lineup (5-3-2): Callender (GK) — Yedlin, Aviles, Kryvtsov, Miller, Allen — Ruiz, Busquets, Cremaschi — Farias, Martinez.

Inter Miami subs (12): Dos Santos (GK), Sailor, Taylor, Mota, Arroyo, Ulloa, Robinson, Messi, Stefanelli.

Defender Alvas Powell is suspended for the match after being sent off against the New York Red Bulls last time out, with Santiago Arias stepping in at right-back.

FC Cincinnati are otherwise light on availability concerns, with only a leg injury for Arquimides Ordonez and a long-term injury to young midfielder Stiven Jimenez to worry about.

Talisman forward Luciano Acosta was partially rested midweek, coming off the bench to score the team's only goal against the Red Bulls in 32 minutes of play, so he is ready to go as he chases the league's Golden Boot award. Also rested midweek was Alvaro Barreal who leads the team in minutes and also logged just 32 of them on Wednesday.

FC Cincinnati starting lineup (5-3-2): Celentano (GK) — Arias, Hagglund, Miazga, Murphy, Barreal — Nwobodo, Acosta, Moreno — Vazquez, Santos.

FC Cincinnati subs (9): Kann (GK), Kubo, Mosquera, Angulo, Badji, Pinto, Halsey, Valenzuela, Boupendza.

sports,Andy Hunter,2023-11-24T22:30:32+00:00,"Sean Dyche is confident Everton’s season will not be derailed by their 10-point penalty for breaching Premier League financial rules but has warned his players that they cannot rely on the club’s appeal to rescue them from another relegation battle.

The Everton manager said he was shocked and aggrieved by an independent commission’s decision to impose the biggest sporting sanction in Premier League history for a £19.5m overspend in 2021-22. Dyche was ill while on holiday in Dubai when informed of the punishment by Everton’s director of football, Kevin Thelwell. He described the deduction as both disproportionate and unjust.

Dyche addressed the first-team squad at Everton’s Finch Farm training ground on Friday morning, once they had all returned from international duty. Players reacted to last Friday’s news by sharing defiant messages on their WhatsApp group. After a run of six wins in nine games in all competitions, that had lifted Everton to 14th in the table prior to being plunged back to 19th, their resolve to maintain momentum and haul the club out of danger was relayed to the manager at Friday’s meeting.

“The feeling was very positive in the sense of building on the mentality that’s been there lately,” said Dyche. “We all spoke about that, saying this hasn’t changed it and it’s building regardless of this current situation. The players are clear-minded. They have their WhatsApp group and when the news broke they put it straight on there: ‘Right lads, just another challenge, this is how we take it on’. The group is taking ownership and that’s a powerful thing.

“I got from them the sense that: ‘What we’re building, we don’t let anything disrupt that and we don’t let anything get in the way’. You can’t guarantee it’s made a difference [to players’ resolve] yet because we haven’t played any games. All I know is that the players know what we’re doing. They’ve referenced that to me probably for the last six weeks.”

Everton’s appeal against the 10-point deduction will be heard by a different three-person panel before the end of the season. Dyche, however, wants his team to forget about the appeal and accept the reality of being joint-bottom of the Premier League on four points. That outlook, he believes, will help Everton focus on hauling themselves out of the relegation zone.

On the prospect of survival, Dyche said: “I’ve never lacked confidence in my own ability, in my staff’s ability or the players’ ability. I’ve never lacked confidence since I’ve been here and, let’s face it, I’ve had some pretty tough times. But it’s not just about confidence. You’ve got to win games, and this is just another big challenge.

“It is currently a momentary thing because we don’t know what the appeal brings, we don’t know how that changes things again. But until that period, and I have made it clear to the players, be under no illusions because there are no guarantees things will change so we have to commit to what’s going on now as if that is the reality. It might be changed but, until it’s changed, we have to commit to this reality. There are no guarantees that what goes before guarantees what comes next. We have to keep pushing like we have been doing because we have lost 10 points and we have to get them back as quick as we can.”

Everton fans have a series of protests against the Premier League planned for Sunday’s home game against Manchester United, when a win could possibly lift Dyche’s team out of the bottom three. After several years of division at Goodison Park, certainly in terms of the fanbase and the club’s hierarchy, the punishment has created a collective siege mentality that Dyche wants his team to utilise.

He said: “I couldn’t wait [for Sunday] anyway because obviously we are on a good run of form – forget about all this. But I will be amazed if the Evertonians are not right on song. I’ll be very surprised if they are not, knowing what I do. I don’t know them yet but I am learning about Evertonians and how they commit to the club and the cause. I’m getting deeper in my knowledge of that and I’ll be very surprised if they are not right there with us. It doesn’t guarantee you’ll win but it gives you a better chance when they are right behind the players going: ‘Come on then, let’s take it on again’.

“I sense that the underbelly, the fans with the depth of knowledge about Everton who remember the hard-fought years and what it has been built upon – not every Evertonian just knows moneyed years – they remember when they had to fight and work to build a team and a mentality. I think they can sense it again. That’s what I think. I think they sense we are getting back to an earthiness, a determined Everton group of players who will really have a go.”

Dyche declined to comment on the implications of Everton’s punishment for Manchester City, who have been charged with 115 financial breaches by the Premier League, and deny any wrongdoing, and Chelsea, who are also under investigation by the football authorities.","Everton players and fans will be fired up by points penalty, asserts Sean Dyche",https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/nov/24/everton-players-and-fans-will-be-fired-up-by-points-penalty-asserts-sean-dyche,The Guardian
sports,Reuters,2023-12-09T20:46:25+00:00,"Eintracht Frankfurt pulverised Bayern Munich 5-1 with a sensational three-goal first-half performance to snap the champions’ unbeaten run in the Bundesliga this season. In an explosive first half, Eintracht completely overran Bayern and exposed their error-prone backline, scoring three times in 24 minutes.

Omar Marmoush opened their account in the 12th minute, drilling in the rebound after Fares Chaibi had hit the crossbar following a miskick from Bayern’s Noussair Mazraoui. After yet more slapdash defending from Bayern, Éric Dina Ebimbe doubled their lead in the 31st minute and Hugo Larsson made it 3-0 five minutes later, benefiting from a Joshua Kimmich error. Kimmich made amends just before the break with a powerful shot from 20 yards to cut the deficit but it did not stop the home side.

Eintracht put the ball in the net again, five minutes after the restart, to make it 4-1, outplaying Bayern with another textbook quick break and with Ebimbe beating Manuel Neuer for his second goal of the afternoon. Ansgar Knauff then slotted in to make it 5-1 on the hour as Frankfurt became the first team in 48 years to score five goals in one hour against Bayern in the Bundesliga since their own 6-0 win in 1975.

“There is no need for an explanation,” said Bayern’s midfielder Thomas Müller. “We have to congratulate Frankfurt who deserved the win. They took the fight out of us in that first half hour. When you lose 5-1 then a reaction has to follow. We won’t lose our heads now. We don’t have enough time but we will bounce back.”

Bayern, who have a game in hand after last week’s game against Union Berlin was postponed due to snow, remain in second place on 32 points, with the leaders, Bayer Leverkusen, on 35, travelling to third-placed VfB Stuttgart, who have 30 points, on Sunday.

Later, RB Leipzig beat 10-man Borussia Dortmund 3-2 to tighten their grip on fourth place and put a further dent in their opponents’ title hopes.

It started badly for the hosts with Mats Hummels sent off for a last-man foul at the edge of the box in the 15th minute, then a Ramy Bensebaini own goal put the visitors in front just after the half-hour.

Dortmund equalised with the last kick of the first half when Niklas Suele volleyed in from the far post. But it was only a matter of time until Leipzig scored again and they did it with Christoph Baumgartner in the 54th.

With Dortmund taking risks in search of an equaliser, Leipzig launched a counterattack and Yussuf Poulsen rifled in before Niclas Füllkrug scored deep in stoppage time for some last-gasp drama. Leipzig are fourth on 29 points and now have a four-point lead over Dortmund in fifth place.

A stunning goal from Real Betis’s Aitor Ruibal cancelled out Jude Bellingham’s strike for Real Madrid early in the second half to earn the home side a 1-1 draw in La Liga. Real Madrid remain top of the table with 39 points, one ahead of Girona, who visit third-placed Barcelona on Sunday.

Bellingham gave the visitors the lead with a fine low finish after Brahim Díaz’s brilliant chipped pass on the edge of the box eight minutes after half-time. The English midfielder reached 15 goals in 17 games across all competitions this season.

Betis bounced back in the 66th minute when Ruibal equalised with a long-range rocket into the far corner.

Internazionale defeated lowly visitors Udinese 4-0 with a dominant performance highlighted by a superb long-range effort from Lautaro Martínez to regain the Serie A top spot on Saturday. Inter moved two points clear of second-placed Juventus, who had a 1-0 home win over champions Napoli on Friday.

Inter took the lead with a penalty by Hakan Calhanoglu in the 36th minute after a foul by defender Nehuén Pérez on Martínez which was reviewed by VAR.

Five minutes later Federico Dimarco fired an unstoppable left-foot shot into the corner of the net after an assist from Calhanoglu before Marcus Thuram netted with a superb finish two minutes later from Henrikh Mkhitaryan’s cross into the box.

Martínez’s stunning effort from distance in the 85th wrapped up a convincing win.

Atalanta snatched a 3-2 victory at home to Milan thanks to a back-heel flick in added time from Luis Muriel after a double from Ademola Lookman. Muriel struck in the 95th minute after the Milan defender Davide Calabria had been dismissed for a second booking two minutes earlier.

Milan, for whom Olivier Giroud and Christian Pulisic scored equalisers, remain third on 29 points, Atalanta are seventh on 23.

Randal Kolo Muani’s late goal helped Paris Saint-Germain to a 2-1 win over Nantes to claim their eighth consecutive Ligue 1 win and extend their lead at the top. PSG moved up to 36 points, six points clear of Monaco, who beat Rennes 2-1. Third-placed Nice are on 29 points and will host Reims on Sunday.

Bradley Barcola opened the scoring in the 41st minute when he found space in the six-yard box after a solo run from the left. Mostafa Mohamed equalised for the visitors in the 55th minute from a corner, heading home from close range.

Kolo Muani restored the lead for PSG seven minutes from time by capitalising on a rebound after a save by the visitors’ keeper following a set piece.",European football: Eintracht Frankfurt hit Bayern for five in famous thrashing,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/dec/09/european-football-eintracht-frankfurt-hit-bayern-for-five-in-famous-thrashing,The Guardian
sports,Kyle Bonn,2023-12-19T22:08:00+00:00,"The 64th edition of the League Cup (also known as the Carabao Cup after its sponsor) got underway on August 8 and we're now at the semifinal strage.

After the Community Shield won by Arsenal on August 6, the League Cup will be the first domestic trophy of the 2023/24 season awarded with the final to take place on Sunday, February 25, 2024 at Wembley Stadium in London.

Manchester United are the holders of the trophy after defeating Newcastle United in the 2023 final. Last season's finalists met in round four after being draw against one another, with the Magpies gaining revenge.

In addition to silverware, the winner of the EFL Cup earns a place in the 2024/25 UEFA Conference League playoffs with a chance to qualify for the group stage of that European cup competition.

How does the Carabao Cup work in 2023/24?

The EFL Cup (Carabao Cup for sponsorship reasons) features all 92 participating clubs from the top four tiers of English football: Premier League (20 clubs), Championship (24 clubs), League One (24), and League Two (24).

The 12 Premier League clubs not involved in European cup competitions joined in the second Round, and the remaining eight sides joining in the third Round.

Why is it called Carabao Cup?

This knockout tournament has historically been called the League Cup or EFL Cup, which unlike the FA Cup which is overseen by the English Football Association (FA), is instead organised by the English Football League (EFL).

The EFL in the past incorporated each of the top four divisions of English football before the formation of the Premier League in 1992/93. Today, the EFL is comprised of the second-tier Championship, third-tier League One, and fourth-tier League Two. But Premier League clubs are still invited to participate in the League Cup (EFL Cup) every season.

Beginning in the 1990s, corporations began paying to attach their name to this tournament and the sponsor names caught on for brief periods when it was known as the Coca-Cola Cup, the Worthington's Cup, and the Carling Cup.

The latest sponsor is Thai energy drink company Carabao, which bought the title rights of the knockout tournament beginning with the 2017/18 edition, leading to the use of the Carabao Cup moniker that is popularly used today.","Carabao Cup fixtures, draws, results, TV channel, and live streams for every round of EFL League Cup 2023/24",https://www.sportingnews.com/us/soccer/news/carabao-cup-fixtures-draw-tv-live-stream-efl-league-cup-2023-24/z8v6zmiks8rfs7npmdamfjjx,Sporting News

Even with his side 2-0 up and cruising against Blackburn thanks to goals from Benoît Badiashile and a rejuvenated Raheem Sterling, the Chelsea manager was a bundle of nerves throughout what turned out to be a comfortable victory in the end.

But while the lack of cutting edge that has become a hallmark of the Todd Boehly-era in west London still looms large as he prepares for his first return to table-topping Tottenham on Monday night, Pochettino could take heart from Cole Palmer’s brilliant performance as the former Manchester City forward helped to dispatch Jon Dahl Tomasson’s inexperienced side.

Having played his part in Badiashile’s opening goal in the defender’s first appearance of the season with a cheeky nutmeg to combine with Conor Gallagher from a quickly-taken corner, Palmer was also involved in Sterling’s goal that sealed this victory in the second half.

Reece James was also a constant menace to Blackburn’s defence as he started for the first time since the opening day of the season on his return from injury and Pochettino admitted he is delighted to have his captain back.

“He is one of the best full-backs in the world and to have been without him for so long has been difficult,” he said. “But we need to be careful and little by little he will get back to full fitness.”

Blackburn’s fortunes since Andy Cole scored the winning goal that saw off Tottenham in the final of this competition more than 20 years ago under Graeme Souness have seen the Lancashire club drop down to the third tier for a season before coming close to reaching the Championship playoffs in the past two campaigns.

They currently find themselves 12th after an inconsistent start but Tomasson opted against sending out his first-choice team despite Chelsea’s recent vulnerabilities at home, with the 26-year-old captain Lewis Travis the oldest player he selected.

“It was the millionaires of the Premier League against the youngsters of the Championship,” reflected the former Denmark forward. “We should be proud of this performance.”

Blackburn certainly managed to cause problems for Chelsea even after the hosts made their intentions clear straight from the kick-off when Nicolas Jackson forced a corner when his shot was blocked. Travis was very lucky not to concede a penalty when he slid in against Sterling after 10 minutes, with no VAR to overrule what looked like a clear and obvious error from the referee Tim Robinson.

It took a good save from Leopold Wahlstedt to deny James but Blackburn then enjoyed a good period of possession in their opponents’ half. James was inches away from breaking the deadlock midway through the first half but his shot just eluded the far post before Enzo Fernández forced Wahlstedt to palm away his effort soon afterwards.

But the Swedish goalkeeper was at fault when Chelsea finally found the goal they were looking for, palming Gallagher’s cross after he had combined with Palmer straight to the feet of Badiashile and he calmly sidefooted home.

Blackburn’s supporters then felt aggrieved when a Callum Brittain cross struck Gallagher’s trailing arm but once again Robinson waved away strong appeals for a penalty.

The visitors showed they had no intention of surrendering without a fight when Harry Leonard caught Axel Disasi napping and raced onto a long ball at the start of the second half, only to curl his shot wide of the post. Not for the first time, Robert Sánchez was then far too casual as the Chelsea goalkeeper’s pass was almost intercepted.

Almost 15 minutes had passed by the time Fernández had Chelsea’s first effort of the second half. Palmer came closer from a tight angle but, having cleared the ensuing corner, Blackburn shot themselves in the foot as they tried to play out. Brittain’s pass was intercepted by Palmer and Sterling curled home from the edge of the area to give Pochettino some welcome breathing space. Jackson should have made it even more comfortable but blazed over from close range before the post denied the outstanding Palmer a goal with a deflected shot.

Sterling could and probably should have added to his tally after finding space in behind Blackburn’s defence on more than one occasion in the closing stages. But it was Palmer who was afforded a standing ovation when he was withdrawn at the end as Chelsea’s supporters celebrated only their fourth home win of the season – three of them in this competition.",Chelsea secure last-eight spot after Raheem Sterling sinks Blackburn,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/nov/01/chelsea-blackburn-carabao-cup-fourth-round-match-report,The Guardian
sports,The New York Times,2023-11-17T21:47:19+00:00,"What is it, really, about Connor Bedard’s shot — a shot that, though he’s just 18 years old, has for years been talked about as if he has patented it — that makes it so dangerous and unique?

What’s the nerdy science of it, from his feet up to his knees, hips, hands and head? How does he prep, shape and let it go? What does it look like to goalies, and to professional shooting coaches, those who’ve taught him — or, more accurately, watched him after he taught himself — and had to stop him? The Athletic spoke with five NHL shooting and skills coaches, his teammates, past opponents and him to try to take apart, piece by piece, “The Bedard.”

Their intel and stories help frame the NHL’s brightest young star’s signature skill.

If there’s one thing Tim Turk knows, it’s shooting. A self-described “shooting and scoring coach,” Turk has more than two decades of experience working with NHL stars, national federations and half a dozen NHL teams.

Turk had no idea who Bedard was when he fielded a call from agent Greg Landry of Newport Sports asking him what he was doing tomorrow.

“Tomorrow?” he said. “I’m booked up a year in advance.”

“We have these two players coming in from out west and we want you to see them,” Landry said.

“Listen, I’m booked up,” Turk said again.

“You have to see them,” Landry insisted.

After moving around his schedule, Turk found himself at Gary Roberts’ personal rink in Uxbridge, Ontario.

“Hey guys, I’m Tim Turk,” he said as he stepped into the small locker room.

“My name’s Nate,” said the redhead, extending a hand.

“My name’s Connor,” said the other, standing shorter and extending his.

“All right, well we’re just going to go out and I’m going to do an evaluation on you and do some shooting and have some fun, and I’ll make suggestions but I’m not here to change anything,” Turk said, giving the two boys his usual spiel and thinking nothing of it.

That evaluation is what he calls an “NHL protocol observation assessment,” which runs new clients through specific drills that allow him to visualize their shooting actions from a technical standpoint (he calls each player’s shot “like a fingerprint”).

That starts with Turk throwing some pucks down in the slot and simply asking them to shoot them stationary so he can watch their body formation, hip and shoulder positions, spine angles and puck preparation and positioning, paying particular attention to where the puck starts in their stance versus where it finishes.

On that day, Nate (Danielson, the Red Wings’ 2023 No. 9 pick) went first, and Turk could tell he was a talented and hard-working player with a good shot and real promise.

Then, on Connor’s turn, Turk placed him in a position and watched how he got the puck ready to shoot. Only Connor didn’t stickhandle and prepare for the shot, he just took the puck and shot it right away.

After watching him run through the same number of shots as Nate did, Turk spoke for the first time.

“Timeout one second, just give me a second here, I’m just trying to see what you’re doing so I’m going to have you take an extra few shots so that I can analyze where the puck’s starting and where it’s finishing,” he said.

Another round later, he knew that this Connor kid, whose last name he still didn’t know and who was then 16, was very different from even his high-end peers simply by his proficiency in shooting from a “frontal position.”

While almost all players point their toes at the net, set the puck at a right angle, load their shot and “drag it in and then snap it off,” Turk says, on a line of 40 to 50 degrees behind their body or at least level with their heels, Bedard brought the puck in “completely lateral.”

Instead of drawing the puck in at a 45-degree angle, he drew it at 180 degrees “right across to the plane of his spine.” Sometimes it even came in at a negative angle. It also happened in a smaller space than it does for other shooters. That lateral inward pull was “condensed — it’s compacted.”

Turk says that Vladimir Tarasenko, whom Turk calls one of the NHL’s quickest shooters, takes 18 inches to pull the puck in. Bedard did it all in 12 square inches — a one-foot box.

Turk’s reaction?

“I was like holy f—,” he said, spelling out the whole profanity, “because the only other person that I know who does it quite like that is No. 34 in Toronto (Auston Matthews), and he still doesn’t bring it in as lateral as Bedzy does.”

After the stationary shooting, they got into some motion drills.

Every time Turk introduced a new formation and shot type for Bedard, his application was “simplistic, and he made it look easy.”

View this post on Instagram A post shared by Tim Turk Hockey (@timturkhockey)

When it was over, both kids said, “This was fun, thanks coach Turky,” and Turk got in his car and drove home.

The next day, he got another call from Landry asking him what he was doing Thursday because the two boys had asked if they could have him back for another session.

“Well who the f— are these guys?” Turk finally asked him.

“Turky, it’s Connor Bedard,” Landry said.

“Who’s Connor Bedard?” Turk asked.

After the second session that same week, Turk didn’t work with Bedard again until a stick manufacturer tried to pitch Bedard, who asked if Turk could be there when he test-drove the sticks.

By then, Turk knew the Bedard name and came away from another session with another takeaway, picking up on Bedard’s eye contact and ability to change his mind mid-shot.

“What makes him unique is that he can be selective with it,” Turk said.

When he looks back on that first blind introduction, Turk laughs.

“You know, most, when you’re in a non-pressure, non-stressful situation, you’ll play around with the puck a lot and then you’ll take your shot because I’m telling them to take their time,” he said. “To me, when he takes a shot, it looks like he just bends down, picks it up with his hand and places it where he wants to.

“He believes that ‘Hey, f— it, the puck is only two and a half inches wide, I can put it wherever I want.'”

Today, Turk would take Bedard’s shot against anyone’s.

“On a shot release basis only, if I had to bet on who could get the puck off the quickest, with the most deception, with optimal speed, power and accuracy based on a starting point to a finishing point, I’m picking Connor Bedard over Auston Matthews,” Turk said. “And I’m not taking anything away from Auston. It’s just a little bit different because one’s a righty, one’s a lefty and one’s got a little bit of a higher-angle pull-in change.”

If there’s one thing Nick Quinn wants people to know about “The Bedard,” it’s that it isn’t just some natural gift.

“I can tell you firsthand it didn’t happen by accident. Connor’s worked on this since he was little,” said Quinn, an NHL skills coach who has worked with Bedard each summer for several years.

If there’s another, it’s how hard Bedard’s shot is to defend because he doesn’t show you he’s preparing for it.

“As replicated in so many other areas of Connor’s game, it’s the deception and elite multi-tasking that catches opponents off guard,” Quinn said. “Connor’s ability to create deception and change the shot angle at top speed is like very few I’ve ever seen. The multi-tasking involved with attempting these shots at top speed is far beyond most player’s capabilities.”

Another shooting coach, who requested anonymity for this story because he works for another NHL club, pointed to Bedard’s hands and legs.

“What’s really interesting is how high and left he can get his top hand,” the coach said. “So many players pull the puck in but can’t get the puck to release from under their body. His footwork is so underrated in that aspect. If you watch his front leg, at times it’s literally in the air at release — most have their back leg in the air at release. When he transfers his weight, he actually clears space for his hands to get tighter because he’s not afraid to actually lunge into the shot.”

A fourth shooting coach, who hasn’t worked with Bedard and also requested anonymity because he works for another NHL club, expressed a little more hesitancy.

“I’m in the minority I’m sure, but I am very curious to see how well his trademark shooting style works at this level,” the coach said. “He really likes to pull pucks right into his feet. I really like his mechanics with his hands off his body and whippy stick — but I feel this habit makes it easier for elite level ‘D’ to get stick on puck or in the lanes to block shots. Finding space and time to let that shot go and get clean looks, I think, will be an adjustment.”

For goalies, it’s the angle change that gets them.

Moose Jaw Warriors goalie Jackson Unger, whom Bedard scored on last year, said the toe-drag release, in particular, is a challenge.

“He changes the angle so quickly that, as a goalie, you have to adjust to it, but when he does it so fast, it’s easier said than done,” Unger said. “It’s a lot of different angles he can give you.”

Sabres first-round pick Zach Benson, who has played on teams with and against Bedard and skates with him in the summers, says it’s Bedard’s ability to set up the shot with his agility pre-shot that stands out to him.

“He can move left to right like no one I’ve seen before,” Benson said.

“It’s just trying to get out, face him, and hope it hits ya,” said Scott Ratzlaff, Seattle Thunderbirds goalie and Buffalo Sabres prospect, with a smile. “He can shoot from anywhere and he’s lethal from anywhere. You’ve just always got to be ready just in case he shoots it. And then he’s got a really good toe drag release, so it’s watching for that and making sure you’re lined up.”

A number of Chicago Blackhawks over the last few decades liked to put in extra time shooting. Patrick Kane would stay out with the young guys, including Alex DeBrincat, well after practice to play shooting games. But even they had a limit.

Bedard doesn’t have much of a limit. It’s common for him to be on the ice an hour after practice taking shots from all over the ice. He even got a few other rookies, especially defenseman Kevin Korchinski, to join him on a regular basis. As the media waits for Bedard at his dressing room stall for interviews, he shoots and shoots and shoots.

Blackhawks coach Luke Richardson has been around long enough to see that in a few other special players.

“I know Jaromir Jagr did this for a long time,” Richardson said. “Even at the end of his career — and he skated around and he had the weights around the bottom of his ankles, practiced full practices like that. It’s happened. That’s their life. They love it so much and they have to be out there. That’s where they feel comfortable and don’t get tired. Hopefully, they go home and have a nap in the afternoon and not watch ‘Young and the Restless.’ Take it easy and get ready for the next day. It does add up when you put the hours of the week in.”

Bedard has downplayed his lengthy post-practice sessions. To him, it’s not like he has weights on his ankles. He’s just shooting, nothing too strenuous.

For someone who shoots as much as Bedard does, you’d think he would gladly accept being called a shooter. He doesn’t.

“I say it a lot: I don’t feel like I’m a shooter,” he said. “I’m just trying to make the right play. If the shot’s there, I’ll take it. Obviously, the goalies are good, you got to hit your spot.”

Blackhawks goalie Arvid Söderblom would certainly call Bedard a shooter. Söderblom and Petr Mrazek have faced more shots from Bedard than any NHL goalies this season. The challenge for them is that Bedard doesn’t just shoot one way. He’s unpredictable.

“When you have that type of shot, quick release, moves his body and shifts angles on the puck, it makes it harder on the goalies,” Söderblom said. “You just saw the two goals (on Sunday against the Florida Panthers), both were quick releases. He finds that open net. He’s a pure goal scorer. It’s fun to have on the team and face him every day and see him take steps, too.”

While goalies are trying to figure out Bedard, he’s been putting in the time to do the same with them. For one, he learned to utilize his teammates more. He accumulated plenty of shots on net early in the season, but they were often from distance and more individualistic chances. Then, he scored his first NHL goal on a wraparound and his next three goals off passes from teammates.

“Look, I’m sure he’ll figure out the one-on-one and how to score that way or create chances that way,” Blackhawks general manager Kyle Davidson said. “There is also an element of working off your teammates. You are in the NHL, so everyone is a pretty good player and you’re able to create using more than just yourself. I think he’s figured that out.”

Bedard found more success on the Blackhawks’ last road trip. He left Chicago with five goals in 11 games and returned from Florida with nine goals in 13 games, scoring twice against the Tampa Bay Lightning and again against the Panthers.

Bedard wasn’t so reliant on teammates on those goals, either. They were more about the work he’s putting in on the other side of the puck.

“Even in practice, we’ve talked to him about maybe tracking harder and attacking pucks on the forecheck and showing him a couple clips,” Richardson said. “Ten, 12 games in, he’s really figuring things out and realizes — why sit back and let things come to him? Go get it.”

None of this is surprising to anyone involved. Bedard doesn’t show it if he impresses himself. And as grateful as the Blackhawks are to have drafted Bedard, this is what they expected. This is why teams lined up to take losses last season.

“It’s not the NHL that he was playing in the last few years,” Davidson said, “but the level of performance and how he could control a game and dominate a game in junior — it indicated he was going to be able to do that at some point in the NHL. You just never how quickly.

“It’s a big adjustment, especially when you’re playing against men and being focused on by the other team every single night. I’m excited for him, but I don’t necessarily feel like it’s a huge surprise how quickly he’s started to really find his groove at the NHL level. But it’s exciting to watch.”

sports,Tony Mejia,2023-12-09T22:09:48+00:00,"Although they’ve played eight games, roughly a quarter of their schedule, the USC Trojans basketball team hasn’t really forged an identity.

Andy Enfield’s team has one of the nation’s top freshmen in Isaiah Collier, a senior who most college basketball fans are familiar with in Boogie Ellis, and most recently lost to Gonzaga in Las Vegas 89-76 in a statement game.

The statement is that they’re not as good as they were expected to be.

USC posted wins over Kansas State and Seton Hall in November, but lost a tight game to a Oklahoma to end the month and then really struggled against the Bulldogs at the MGM Grand Garden Arena on Dec. 2, trailing from start to finish. Gonzaga led by as many as 18 points, overcame Ellis scoring 28 and outscored the Trojans 21-8 on fast breaks.

At the moment, USC isn’t making the most of a talented roster. We’re about to see whether Bronny James can have a positive impact since he’s expected to make his debut on Sunday against Long Beach State.

Bronny James expected to make collegiate debut Sunday

James, the oldest son of LeBron James, is going to play his first college game on Sunday against Long Beach State after suffering cardiac arrest while practicing this summer. He's expected to be on a minutes restriction, but he’ll be moving into the role that was envisioned for him as an impactful presence off the bench.

He may immediately provide a boost off the bench since USC can definitely use another body to improve depth.

James, a guard, is listed at 6-foot-4, weighs 210 pounds, and had a great prep career. ESPN viewed him as a top-20 recruit.

James excelled in the McDonald’s All-American game, made big plays to aid Team USA’s win in the most recent Hoop Summit and is expected to contribute immediately. It really doesn’t matter if he’s starting, but whether he’s on the court to close out games will be intriguing to see.

USC basketball futures odds to win Pac-12, make Final Four

Here are the latest futures odds for USC at top-rated sportsbooks:

USC hasn’t done much to enhance or tarnish its resume in the season’s first few weeks. A loss to UC Irvine doesn’t help its at-large chances but isn’t a deal-breaker either. A solid showing in Pac-12 play should see them enter the NCAA Tournament field of 68 comfortably.

While UCLA isn’t expected to be as formidable as it has been in years past, Arizona is ranked No. 1 nationally and is basically an even money choice to win the Pac-12 as a clear favorite. At most books, USC is ranked as the second choice to win the conference behind the Wildcats.

They’re listed as high as to win the National Championship depending on where you shop, so there’s definitely an opportunity to cash in on them if you’re bullish on their ability to improve and blossom into a title contender.

Collier (+3500) and Ellis () have odds on them in the Player of the Year race, with Purdue’s Zach Edey basically an even money favorite since he won last season and is off to a terrific start. Collier, a freshman, has lived up to the hype, averaging 17.3 points, 3.0 rebounds and 4.5 assists through his first eight games.

He’s scored in double-figures each time out and has set a personal-best with six assists in each of the last two games. One concern is that he went just 2-for-6 from the free-throw line in the loss to Gonzaga, but he had shot the ball reasonably well beforehand so his off night may have just been an aberration.

Ellis is one of college basketball’s best scorers, a shot creator who can get hot from the perimeter, so he should also enjoy a strong season in conference play.

Small forward Kobe Johnson, younger brother of Atlanta Hawks forward Jalen Johnson, is a great glue guy who can score, rebound and facilitate. 6-foot-6 Washington State transfer DJ Rodman, 6-foot-11 senior Joshua Morgan, 6-foot-11 freshman Arrinten Page and 7-foot-1 sophomore x-factor Vincent Iwuchukwu anchor the frontcourt, so James will have plenty of bodyguards and will presumably get minutes at the guard spots.

Iwuchukwu, who had his own health scare last season, was one of the nation’s top recruits and comes off Enfield’s bench. His potential as a game-changer is well known, but he’s striving for consistency. If he and James develop chemistry among the USC reserves, this team is going to be tough to handle over the course of 40 minutes on a nightly basis.

Long Beach State vs. USC odds: Point spread, total

Here are the latest college basketball betting odds for Long Beach vs. USC:

Spread: LBSU 14.5 (-110); USC 14.5 (-110)

Total: 159.5 (OVER/UNDER -110)

Sunday's game against Long Beach State represents USC’s last home game until conference play begins in January. The 49ers are 6-4 and have wins over major conference squads in DePaul and Michigan.

They upset the Wolverines in Ann Arbor and have beaten Iona, Montana State, and Sacramento State since then, losing to Illinois State and Louisiana. Highly respected head coach Dan Monson leads a solid team that is plenty capable of pulling off an upset at the Galen Center, so tread lightly if you’re wagering on Bronny’s debut.

Following this contest, the Trojans will visit Auburn and Alabama State as they venture into the south to prepare for conference play. USC opens Pac-12 play at Oregon and Oregon State late this month before hosting Cal and Stanford. They’ll only be an underdog against the Ducks, so there is a great opportunity on paper to get off to a strong start.

The Trojans play Arizona and UCLA twice, so their schedule is difficult, but there’s no question there’s enough talent in place to make a run at a title despite what went down last weekend against Gonzaga. If James is special as a difference maker, the Trojans are talented enough to factor into the Pac-12 race.","USC basketball futures odds to win Pac-12, NCAA tourney ahead of Bronny James collegiate debut",https://www.sportingnews.com/us/betting/news/usc-basketball-futures-odds-bronny-james-debut/1c11465b6bc450ba68c353e1,Sporting News
sports,Kyle Bonn,2023-10-12T21:11:00+00:00,"Argentina continue their start to CONMEBOL 2026 World Cup qualifying with a home date against Paraguay, the first of two qualifiers for the world champions in this international break.

Lionel Messi has been dealing with fitness concerns the past few weeks, missing significant time for his club Inter Miami, but he is on the roster and expected to play a part for the national team. According to a report from Argentina, Messi will not start tonight's match, but he is likely to play much or all of the second half.

He is helping to usher in a youth movement up front for Argentina, with Julian Alvarez and Alejandro Garnacho considered the future of the forward line. With Angel Di Maria not fit for duty this month, that will be even more in the spotlight here and in the follow-up in Peru.

Paraguay were not close to qualifying for the last World Cup, unable to reach a FIFA tournament since 2010. However, with the 2026 World Cup field — and by extension, qualifying across all federations — expanding this cycle, Los Guaranies will consider themselves real contenders for a spot and thus points will be at a premium in every match.

Argentina vs Paraguay starting lineups & team news

Argentina head coach Lionel Scaloni named a bloated 36-man squad for the matches against Paraguay and Peru this month, but Angel Di Maria, Paulo Dybala, and Juan Foyth were forced to withdraw due to injury. Lisandro Martinez is also unavailable after having to undergo another foot operation.

Now that Inter Miami's playoff run is officially over, Argentina can feel a little better about deploying Lionel Messi at full 90-minute use despite his recent fitness issues, knowing his club season is nearly over and he'll have months of rest upcoming. Messi missed the last match against Bolivia, and missed four Inter Miami games after, but he returned for a half-hour of action in their final fixture before the international break. However, he doesn't start, but is reportedly fit enough to come off the bench for most or all of the second half.

Nicolas Tagliafico started both matches in September, and while Marcos Acuna is back with the team following an injury, the former retains his starting spot. Messi's club teammate Facundo Farias was also included on the roster but it'd be surprising if he saw the field.

Argentina starting lineup (4-3-3): E. Martinez (GK) — Molina, Romero, Otamendi, Tagliafico — De Paul, Mac Allister, E. Fernandez — J. Alvarez, L. Martinez, N. Gonzalez.

New Paraguay head coach Daniel Garnero, making his debut, has rung the changes after falling to Venezuela last time out, making five alterations to that starting lineup. The entire midfield is swapped out, while Adam Bareiro takes over at striker, earning his debut international cap in place of Gabriel Avalos.

Forward Miguel Almiron is Paraguay's most prominent goalscoring threat and is in good form, with three goals in his past five matches for Newcastle United.

Paraguay have questions at goalkeeper, as mainstay Antony Silva has been phased out, leaving three inexperienced internationals currently on the roster. New York Red Bulls starter Carlos Coronel earned his first two caps in the September matches and he remains in net here. Lionel Messi's Inter Miami teammate Diego Gomez was named to the Paraguay roster but was forced to withdraw due to injury.

Paraguay starting lineup (5-4-1): C. Coronel (GK) — I. Ramirez, G. Gomez, Balbuena, Alonso, Espinoza — R Sanchez, Campuzano, Almiron, Bareiro — Sosa.

sports,The New York Times,2023-11-15T21:40:47+00:00,"Chelsea Women had created a frenzy. On Nov. 4, the English club released a statement saying their coach Emma Hayes was leaving at the end of the season to “pursue a new opportunity outside of the Women’s Super League and club football.” Hayes had just entered her second decade in charge of the club, and few knew where she would land next.

That same day The Athletic, among others, reported that Hayes’ next job would be with the U.S. women’s national team, leading a four-time World Cup and Olympic gold medal-winning program into a new era. On Tuesday, U.S. Soccer made her appointment official.

Hayes, who previously won six WSL titles in England, will become the 10th full-time coach of the U.S., but not until her final season with Chelsea is complete next May. Sporting director Matt Crocker made the final decision to hire Hayes after a search process that began in August, following the team’s surprising exit in the round of 16 at the World Cup and the subsequent departure of head coach Vlatko Andonovski.

“She has tremendous energy and an insatiable will to win,” U.S. Soccer president Cindy Parlow Cone said in a statement. “Her experience in the USA, her understanding of our soccer landscape and her appreciation of what it means to coach this team makes her a natural fit for this role and we could not be more pleased to have her leading our women’s national team forward.”

Though Hayes is seen as one of the world’s top coaches in women’s soccer, the appointment still comes as something of a surprise. Here’s how the deal got done.

Details of the deal

At least part of the surprise surrounding Hayes’ hire – and the six-month runway before she officially takes charge – is down to U.S. Soccer’s own messaging. Crocker, in a September meeting with U.S. reporters along with Cone and U.S. Soccer CEO J.T. Batson, said he hoped to have a new head coach in place by December.

But the initial contact with Hayes was made a couple of months ago, early into the search, with all three top-level executives from U.S. Soccer involved in those talks. The trio also described the interview process to journalists in that September meeting – a U.S. soccer statement describes it as involving “psychometrics and abstract reasoning tests, in-depth discussions of strategy, coaching philosophy and the current player pool, as well as evaluation on the reactions to pressure, culture-building and interactions with players and staff.” USMNT coach Gregg Berhalter went through a similar process, including an abstract reasoning test, when he was re-hired by Crocker earlier in 2023.

The hiring process included multiple rounds of evaluation, with the list of candidates becoming smaller each time. The first pass was driven purely by data, which was then whittled down to a double-digit list Crocker was considering as of September, and then a final shortlist, which also included Tony Gustavsson, head coach of Australia. Multiple sources confirmed both Hayes and Gustavsson flew to the U.S. for interviews.

One source who was briefed on the situation said the federation had also checked in on the availability of Sarina Wiegman, despite clear messaging from both the English FA and Wiegman herself in August. “I’m staying out of it. I’ve heard it (from the press officer) but no, I’m with England and I’m really happy with England, and I have a contract until 2025,” Wiegman said. A representative from her camp declined to comment for this story.

Crocker said in September that the final interviews would include lengthy technical and tactical assessments, as well as questions to determine the candidates’ cultural fit. He and the federation stayed fairly consistent on their desired start date since the head coach role opened in August, but that became one of the major concessions made by U.S. Soccer in selecting Hayes.

Hayes will remain exclusively with Chelsea through the end of their WSL campaign and the Champions League season. She will not work with the U.S. in international windows.

“I’m here until the end,” she said in her press conference on Friday. “I haven’t died, I haven’t gone anywhere. I’m here, doing this job. My full focus and attention is on what I do for Chelsea.”

Hayes could be tied up with Chelsea as late as May 25 if the London club makes the Champions League final; notably, an international window that would theoretically be Hayes’ first in charge begins just two days later, on May 27.

However, there are ways in which the arrangement will benefit U.S. Soccer. The federation won’t owe any compensation to Chelsea, and Hayes will be fully committed to the program, with a move to Chicago in the works for next year following the completion of her time in London. Eventually, she’s expected to relocate to Atlanta thanks to U.S. Soccer’s planned combined headquarters and national training facility in Georgia. As of yet, there’s no targeted date set for the move.

Hayes, too, will benefit in ways other than compensation and prestige. She spoke to reporters about looking forward to spending more time with her five-year-old son, Harry. She has never been to one of his sports days, picked him up from school or taken him to an after-school club and she wants to do that.

The main visible wrinkle in the process was Chelsea’s surprise move of announcing Hayes’ departure on Saturday, Nov. 4. With the contract not yet finalized and U.S. Soccer board approval still needed, Chelsea issued their statement at 11 a.m. ET in the U.S. in which it noted she would leave at the end of the season “to pursue a new opportunity outside of the WSL and club football.” The club feared that the news was starting to leak and wanted to share the news on its own. This began the race to confirm Hayes had been selected as the USWNT head coach.

Talks between U.S. Soccer and Hayes’ representatives continued even after Chelsea’s press release. The federation’s board convened late on Saturday, Nov. 4 to approve the selection, even without the final details of the contract settled or signed.

At the end of it all, the sides have agreed to a deal that will make Hayes the highest-paid women’s football coach in the world — though her salary is not tied to equal compensation with Berhalter. While her salary is in the same range as the USMNT head coach, it’s thought to be a reflection of the market value for Hayes. With reports that Chelsea was prepared to quadruple her salary to keep her, Hayes herself danced around the details in her first media availability with the club.

“I believe in private conversations,” she said. “Of course, I’m disappointed to hear things being said in the press. I want to make sure I maintain my own professionalism in everything I do.”

U.S Soccer’s annual financial reports reveal the salaries of their head coaches and other executives. While Berhalter received a new contract this year, his previous deal that ran from April 2021 to March 2022, earned him $1.6 million, including $300,000 in bonuses. During that same time, Andonovski earned $446,495, of which only $50,000 was bonus money. With Hayes expected to earn close to $2 million per year in her deal, this will likely create a knock-on effect for other international women’s coaches negotiating their next contracts.

U.S. Soccer’s rollout of their new head coach has not been an easy one for the federation’s communications staff, considering that Hayes is essentially unavailable for any formal ceremonies or media appearances until her time with Chelsea is complete.

“This is a huge honor to be given the opportunity to coach the most incredible team in world football history,” she said in a statement on Tuesday. “The feelings and connection I have for this team and for this country run deep. I’ve dreamed about coaching the USA for a long time so to get this opportunity is a dream come true. I know there is work to do to achieve our goals of winning consistently at the highest levels. To get there, it will require dedication, devotion and collaboration from the players, staff and everyone at the U.S. Soccer Federation.”

Looking ahead for the USWNT

Hayes’ appointment will have an immediate impact, even if she’s not immediately present. The particulars around timing and the plan moving forward have been one of the areas of discussion between Hayes and her representatives, Chelsea and U.S. Soccer that has continued through the start of November.

Unless the situation changes drastically, Hayes will only have two camps, including four friendlies, with the USWNT ahead of the 2024 Olympics in Paris. She’ll miss three international windows between Tuesday’s announcement and her planned start date, including the 2024 CONCACAF Gold Cup in February and March.

U.S. Soccer has a plan in place for the transition. Current interim head coach Twila Kilgore will continue in the role through May and will remain as a permanent assistant coach under Hayes after the swap is complete. U.S. Soccer said that Kilgore and the rest of the technical staff are working on a handoff plan for Hayes.

“This is a unique situation, but the team is in safe hands with Twila,” Crocker said. “Her stewardship will be crucial during this period as we are focused on success at the Olympics. Emma has endorsed Twila, she will be a key part of Emma’s staff when she arrives and moving forward, and we are excited for what’s to come with our USWNT program.”

GO DEEPER How Emma Hayes' winning ways at Chelsea can benefit USWNT on the field

It’s still an extremely tight turn for the Olympics, with 18 days for Hayes to get situated with the team ahead of the tournament, between the two international windows from May 27 to June 4, then July 8 to 16. The Olympic tournament will start on July 25.

There are, of course, logistical questions about roster selection over the next few months. Some of those may be answered relatively soon, with the roster for the upcoming camp that begins at the end of the month imminent. The greater challenge will likely be ongoing player evaluation over the next six months, at a time of great transition within the squad. The specifics of how that will work without Hayes’ involvement remain a mystery. It would be understandable for players to feel like they are still auditioning for an absent director until May rolls around, while still knowing they must perform at the USWNT standard.

Along these same lines, there is at least the suggestion that the federation could be willing to sacrifice coherent preparation for this upcoming Olympic tournament to focus more on the longer-term project of the 2027 World Cup. That itself represents a marked change from the expectations and pressure of constant performance and winning that the team is known for.

Is that a good or a bad thing? Perhaps a little bit of both. The USWNT shouldn’t be ruled out of contention for the Olympics by any stretch, but this past summer’s World Cup did reveal that the problems facing the team are far more foundational than just poor coaching decisions or the strange midfield chemistry. Balancing realism with the pressure to win feels like a much more sustainable path forward for the USWNT.

GO DEEPER USWNT's Emma Hayes hire could create a problem in preparation for the Olympics

What’s next for Chelsea?

Questions surrounding Hayes’ future have cropped up previously in her tenure at Chelsea. She was linked to several jobs in the men’s English Football League in the past and has always been interested in managing Spain’s national team, although there was never an official conversation with Spain’s federation. So it was a question of when, not if, Hayes would leave. Still, news of her decision came as a shock to her staff and players.

A few staff members were told on the morning of Nov. 4 before Chelsea’s away game at Aston Villa kicked off at 12.30 p.m. UK time. Most of the other staff members found out with the players in the post-match meeting minutes before the official club statement, which Hayes had no hand in writing and did not even see before publication, was released at 3 p.m.

England and Chelsea captain Millie Bright was “devastated,” and most players were understandably sad — many of whom owe their career progression to Hayes — but know they still have a job to do this season.

“It’s been a bit of a whirlwind. As a player and a person, I was devastated. I’ve been here nine years under Emma and the things I’ve learned,” Bright said. “She’s a mentor, a coach, a friend, a life coach. It’s more than just football playing under her.”

Bright credits Hayes for her on and off-field guidance. (Photo by Marc Atkins, Getty Images)

Hayes’ American assistant Denise Reddy, born in New Jersey, is likely to follow her across the pond. The former United States Under-20 coach has remained faithful to her friend of 20 years and voluntarily quit her job as assistant at Chicago Red Stars in 2010 when Hayes was fired as head coach. Chelsea’s general manager Paul Green will stay at the club. It is unclear whether any other members of Chelsea’s technical staff are expected to depart.

GO DEEPER What next for Chelsea after Emma Hayes?

The relentless nature of managing a club takes its toll and after what will be 12 years at Chelsea come the end of the season, Hayes, a single parent whose father died last month, decided that it was the right time for a change, professionally and personally.

“The biggest factors are my son, leaving at the top and giving the club enough time to be able to transition without there being too much disruption,” she said in her press conference.

The club has received several applications regarding Hayes’ replacement but has not yet started an official recruitment process. She will meet with Chelsea’s technical directors once a week to create a succession plan and will have a say in who takes the job after her.

There is the possibility of Hayes retaining a connection to the club via some sort of ambassadorial role, but it’s likely contingent upon a lack of conflict with the USWNT role and responsibilities. Under American Todd Boehly’s co-ownership, expanding Chelsea’s profile and reach in the U.S. would make sense, especially with USWNT internationals Catarina Macario and Mia Fishel playing their club football there — and CBS Sports holding WSL rights.

There is, for now, an immediate task for Hayes to focus on. Chelsea faces off against Real Madrid on Wednesday for their first match of the UWCL Champions League group stage. Her full American arrival will not come for another half a year after that.

sports,David Hytner,2023-10-20T21:30:28+00:00,"It was the moment when Reece James simply could not handle the frustration. Named by Mauricio Pochettino as the Chelsea captain, James had not played since the opening weekend draw with Liverpool at Stamford Bridge when he injured a hamstring. Now, he seethed from the sideline as his team lost 1-0 at home to Aston Villa, a game in which his replacement, Malo Gusto, was controversially sent off.

It was 24 September, Chelsea’s second home Premier League defeat on the spin after the one against Nottingham Forest and they were booed off again. James would lose his cool with an official in the tunnel and, when a Football Association charge was announced three days later for abusive conduct, it felt like only a matter of time before he was given a one-match ban.

It did not come in time for Chelsea’s visit to Fulham on 2 October, when James was still injured. That would have been too simple. Rather for their next game at Burnley on 7 October when, according to Pochettino, James was back in contention for selection.

The 23-year-old was not called up by England for the internationals over this past window and the idea was that he would work to be ready for Saturday’s home derby against Arsenal. And yet there have been stories of an injury setback, even that he may need surgery to get to the root of his hamstring issues.

Pochettino bustled his way through those questions on Friday and the best read on James’s status was that he would be back in the squad for Arsenal, most likely as a substitute. Gusto is available again after his own suspension. “It [James’s hamstring] is much better,” Pochettino said. “He is progressing well, still not at his best, 100%. But maybe to help the team at some point …. maybe, he is close to be there.”

It has not been straightforward and it seems to remain that way. Yet there were two takeaways from Pochettino on James – with a common thread running through them. First, James could be like a coiled spring when he finally returns to action. And second, Pochettino was in no mood to criticise him for his indiscipline. On the contrary. He was happier to talk up James’s passion.

“It’s part of the business,” Pochettino said. “He was upset about the situation [against Villa] and then you need to understand that he is so committed to this project from the beginning. He feels really bad because he cannot help the team [because of his injury].

“He made a mistake, we all make them and he was really sorry about it. I think he’s not going to repeat the situation. This is a young guy that wants to play football. He was frustrated and he made a mistake. That’s it. Finish.”

Pochettino made James his captain because of “his personality, his leadership, the respect he has from the club and his teammates … he has Chelsea DNA”. He described him as an appointment “for the present and the future – we cannot change captain every season, every six months”.

It is also easy to imagine that Pochettino sees something of himself in James; the self-belief, the running on the emotions of a match day. Pochettino made the point that he had got himself booked for dissent during the Burnley game. And then there is his connection with the Arsenal manager, Mikel Arteta; there are similarities, albeit this relationship is rather deeper, going back to their time together as players at Paris Saint-Germain.

There is a reason why Pochettino calls Arteta “family”. They joined PSG at the same time, early 2001; Pochettino was 28, Arteta 18. They hit it off immediately, Pochettino wowed by Arteta’s charisma and his reading of the game. “Already, he was a coach,” Pochettino said, and he has no qualms with what some perceive as Arteta’s histrionic touchline behaviour.

“It’s how you are and about your character,” Pochettino said. “He feels football. I am 51 and still sometimes I feel that decisions are no good or unfair. You are competitive. Like with Mikel or myself or other coaches that played football, in our minds, we still believe we can play. Still, we have the animal instinct. We cannot be thinkers.”

For Pochettino, it must be about channeling the emotion in the right way and not suppressing it. More broadly, he is in a better place after the wins at Fulham and Burnley, which followed the Carabao Cup victory over Brighton on the day that James was charged.

Arsenal represent an acid test of the progress and the start of a daunting run in the league; after them, Chelsea face Brentford, Tottenham, Manchester City, Newcastle, Brighton and Manchester United. Pochettino, though, pushed back against the notion that he was seeking a first statement win at the club, something to ignite his tenure. All he wants are points to drive his team up from 11th in the table.

Pochettino has appeared mired in a selection crisis since his arrival at Chelsea; James only one element of it and he will be without seven others through injury against Arsenal.

“The moment we have all the squad at a high level and fit, we can say: ‘OK, we are going to Arsenal, Manchester City and we are going to beat you.’ At the moment, with the circumstances, I don’t think this game is going to be a statement to say: ‘Be careful, Chelsea is coming,’ or something like this.”",Pochettino looks past James mistake and stakes future on his ‘Chelsea DNA’,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/oct/20/pochettino-reece-james-mistake-future-chelsea-dna-arsenal,The Guardian
sports,,2023-10-20T21:30:00+00:00,"Mauricio Pochettino and Mikel Arteta meet as head coaches for the first time on Saturday - but the Chelsea and Arsenal bosses know each other inside out. ""He's part of my family,"" says the Argentinean.

Rewind to 2001 and Arteta - just a teenager - had arrived at Paris Saint-Germain on loan from Barcelona's B side. It was his first experience in the first team of a top-flight side and he was struggling to come to terms with the transition.

Fortunately, PSG had another new recruit. Pochettino - 10 years Arteta's senior - took the Spaniard under his wing.

""It was my first professional opportunity in Paris and we arrived at the same time and lived together in a hotel for three months,"" Arteta said on Friday.

""He was critical, he has been one of the most influential people in my career, firstly as a player, he took me under the arm and looked after me like a little child, a little brother.

""He was a big part of the success I had in Paris. It was because of him because he really looked after me, gave me a lot of confidence and a lot of advice.""

Pochettino has equally fond recollections of that period and says the signs were already there that Arteta would make a successful coach in the future.

""Amazing memories. We share values and the passion for football,"" Pochettino said.

""He's part of my family from day one. We arrived in Paris together and we spent time together with our families, first of all in the hotel and then we lived very close.

""It was an amazing history. He's not surprised me with what he's doing because he was a coach already at 17!

""He was really good with how he saw football. He can be one of the greatest managers in the world.""

Image: Mikel Arteta and Mauricio Pochettino will meet for the first time as opposition managers when Arsenal go to Chelsea on Saturday

Picking out Arteta's strengths, Pochettino explained why he thinks the Gunners boss is destined for the top.

""What Arsenal are showing is because he's one of the best,"" Pochettino said. ""I don't care if he's young or not young - he's one of the best coaches in the world.

""It's not only about being good tactically - it's about how you manage people, the media, the owners, the sporting director. It's not only about being clever.""

Live: SNF

Arteta - who labelled Pochettino's early work at Chelsea as 'phenomenal' - revealed in his press conference ahead of his side's trip to Stamford Bridge that Pochettino's influence continued from those early days through his career as a player and into coaching.

""I went from playing Ligue 1 to a week later Champions League in Milan, I was all over the place,"" said Arteta. ""I didn't speak the language, it was my first professional club and I needed someone to be close to me, give me confidence, give me support, because I was thrown in there and they said 'play, you're in the starting XI'.

""So he was coaching me, talking to me. Really, really inspirational. He was really supportive. I was living with him for 2-3 months so that period was key in my career to be able to make it.

""He's an expert at giving you confidence and then keeping you on your toes all the time and being really harsh on me every time I was doing something: 'Where have you been last night?!' He really looked after me.

""The way he understood the game was phenomenal. I used to have him at my back and he was constantly coaching me. Very proud of what he has done and the way he has done it throughout his coaching career.

""I'm so grateful for what he did for me and the way he guided me in those early years. He got something else out of me that was needed in that period to make it and stayed with me in my football career as a player and coach.""

Pochettino is relishing the prospect of going head-to-head with Arteta on Saturday - although admitted there would be no favours for an old friend when the first whistle blows.

""It's going to be really nice because my love for him is there,"" said the Chelsea boss.

""He's more than a friend - he's family. It's going to be strange. But we are really competitive and you want to win. You want to destroy the opponent!""

Arteta shared a similar sentiment.

""It's great that after those years we're in this situation where you face each other and we're both managing great clubs in the best league in the world. it doesn't get better than that.

""On game day? Go for him! He is going to do the same. We are both winners.""

Friends reunited

It won't just be Pochettino and Arteta seeing familiar faces on Saturday. The derby will be the first time Kai Havertz and Jorginho have gone back to play at Stamford Bridge since leaving Chelsea for Arsenal.

""I'm sure they'll be excited,"" said Arteta. ""They were there and they talked really highly about the club. I'm sure it'll be a special day for them.""

Havertz will command particular focus after his early struggles at Arsenal. With just one goal in 12 appearances for the club there are questions about his form and role.

Armando Broja will miss Chelsea's game against Arsenal due to ""irritation"" in his knee. Late checks will be made on the fitness of Reece James, Axel Disasi and Nicolas Jackson, while Benoit Badiashile could return from a long-term injury.

Enzo Fernandez and Moises Caicedo should be available despite travelling to South America during the international break.

Ben Chilwell, Carney Chukwuemeka, Christopher Nkunku, Romeo Lavia, Wesley Fofana and Trevoh Chalobah remain unavailable.

Arsenal will make a late call on the fitness of Bukayo Saka, William Saliba and Leandro Trossard.

Saka missed the win over Man City before the international break after limping out of both the Champions League defeat at Lens and previous win over Bournemouth. He was also unavailable for England duty.

Meanwhile, Saliba was forced to withdraw from the France squad to rest a 'chronic toe injury', despite a starring role in that win over City. Trossard came off at half-time in that match and missed Belgium's games with a hamstring issue.

sports,Cody Benjamin,2023-11-19T23:51:49+00:00,"Week 11 of the 2023 NFL season has provided plenty of drama, from the Bears hanging with the Lions to the Giants getting a rebound from emergency quarterback Tommy DeVito. But the latest round of regular-season action has also brought another wave of unfortunate injuries. Here's a roundup of the latest big names to go down around the league:

QB

C.J. Stroud (Texans) left for a single play against the Cardinals after absorbing a hard hit, with backup Davis Mills entering in relief. Stroud did not receive an injury designation, however, and returned after a quick check-in from trainers.

Geno Smith (Seahawks) suffered an injury to his throwing arm after guiding a 16-7 lead over the Rams, showing frustration while trying to stretch the arm after a hit from Aaron Donald. Seattle quickly ruled him questionable to return with an elbow issue, and backup Drew Lock took over under center with 18 seconds left in the third quarter. Smith did return, however, for the final drive of the game in the losing effort. Head coach Pete Carroll said that Smith will ""make it back."" When asked if that means for Thursday's matchup against San Francisco, the coach said, ""I would think so.""

Sam Howell (Commanders) received medical attention on the sidelines after enduring several hard hits to the upper body on a touchdown run against the Giants. He was quickly cleared of a potential concussion, however, and remained in the game. Veteran journeyman Jacoby Brissett is Washington's backup.

RB

Aaron Jones (Packers) suited up against the Chargers despite a lingering hamstring issue, only to manage just five carries before suffering a knee injury. The former Pro Bowler needed help to leave the field and was then carted to the locker room, replaced by A.J. Dillon. Green Bay ruled him questionable to return, then downgraded him to out, but coach Matt LaFleur said after the Packers' win over Los Angeles that he doesn't expect the injury to be a long-term issue.

De'Von Achane (Dolphins) returned from injured reserve -- and a four-game absence -- but limped to the sidelines after his second touch of the first quarter against the Raiders. Miami ruled him questionable to return with a knee injury, and while he later returned to the sidelines from a locker-room visit, he was replaced on the field indefinitely by Raheem Mostert. Head coach Mike McDaniel told reporters on Monday that Achane is day-to-day. While he hasn't been ruled out of Friday's matchup with the Jets, he's not been given the green light either, so his status is worth monitoring.

Kenneth Walker III (Seahawks) took four carries against the Rams before leaving with an oblique injury. He was seen walking on the sidelines shortly afterward but ruled doubtful to return. Rookie Zach Charbonnet, who entered Week 11 with just over 200 rushing yards on the year, replaced Walker as Seattle's top ball carrier. Following the game, Seahawks head coach Pete Carroll told reporters Walker suffered an ""oblique strain that was legit"" and could miss time.

D'Onta Foreman (Bears) remained a headliner of Chicago's backfield against the Lions, even with Khalil Herbert back from injured reserve, but managed just 14 yards on the ground before suffering an ankle injury. He walked off with a limp and attempted to run on the sidelines but did not return to the field after the Bears ruled him questionable.

WR

Tyreek Hill (Dolphins) briefly left Miami's game against the Raiders while nursing a hand injury and was ruled questionable to return, but he took the field again soon afterward, securing seven catches for 80 yards and a score before halftime. Hill has left multiple games this year, only to return in all of them.

Cooper Kupp (Rams) had just a single catch against the Seahawks before suffering an ankle injury while blocking. The former All-Pro, who battled a lingering hamstring injury earlier this year, received attention on the sidelines after limping off, then left the game for further evaluation in the locker room. He was ruled questionable to return. NFL Media reported on Monday that Kupp suffered a low ankle sprain and will be evaluated going forward.

Darius Slayton (Giants) had a big impact against the Commanders, hauling in a deep score from Tommy DeVito, before exiting with an arm injury. He was ruled out for the remainder of the contest halfway through the third quarter.

EDGE

Joey Bosa (Chargers) appeared to injure his right leg or foot while held in a block during a first-quarter pass-rushing attempt against the Packers. He limped to the sidelines and was carted to the locker room, then ruled questionable to return.

DB

Talanoa Hufanga (49ers), who emerged as a ballhawk for San Francisco's secondary in 2022, left early against the Buccaneers with a knee injury. Coach Kyle Shanahan confirmed to reporters on Monday that the All-Pro suffered a season-ending ACL tear.","2023 NFL Week 11 injury roundup: Rams WR Cooper Kupp, Seahawks RB Kenneth Walker III among stars to exit",https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/news/2023-nfl-week-11-injury-roundup-rams-wr-cooper-kupp-seahawks-rb-kenneth-walker-iii-among-stars-to-exit/,CBSSports.com
sports,Nick Musial,2023-11-29T20:27:00+00:00,"In the final weeks of the fantasy football regular season, rolling out a strong receiver corps comprised of wideouts set up for high usage days is every fantasy owner's goal. Having those WRs in plus matchups makes it even more likely you'll end the week in the win column. Our Week 13 fantasy WR PPR rankings can help pinpoint all the studs and sleepers at fantasy's deepest position.

There aren't as many studs or sleepers this week, as six byes and some inopportune injuries thin out our rankings. Nonetheless, we still have to fill out the same number of starting spots in our lineups, so those in 12-team leagues might have to dig deep to find decent WR3s and flexes. That's where we come in.

Now that we know the backdrop to this pivotal week, let's break down our Week 13 WR rankings.

MORE: Watch NFL RedZone live with Sling (50% off first month)

Which WRs are on bye in Week 13?

With the Ravens, Bills, Vikings, Raiders, Giants, and Bears idle in Week 13, that means Davante Adams, Stefon Diggs, Justin Jefferson, DJ Moore, Zay Flowers, Jakobi Meyers, and Jordan Addison are among the most notable wideouts omitted from our rankings. Deep-league owners will also be without Odell Beckham Jr., K.J. Osborn, Gabe Davis, Jalin Hyatt, and Khalil Shakir.

WEEK 13 PPR RANKINGS:

QBs | RBs | TEs | D/STs | Kickers

Unfortunately, we also won't get to pick on the poor WR defenses of the Giants and Vikings, but it's a relief to see the Ravens' shut-down secondary on the sidelines.

WEEK 13 STANDARD RANKINGS:

QBs | RBs | WRs | TEs | D/STs | Kickers

Who are the best fantasy WRs in Week 13?

Tyreek Hill (@ Commanders in Week 13) did his thing despite a tough matchup in Week 12, resulting in Miami's WR1 returning to the top spot against a putrid Washington stop unit. CeeDee Lamb (vs. Seahawks) isn't far behind, as Dallas' WR1 aims to maintain his efficient play against Seattle.

Amon-Ra St. Brown (@ Saints) has been a target hog the past several weeks, seeing at least nine looks in each of his past six games. Don't expect his workload to decrease in a bounce-back game for the Lions. Keenan Allen (@ Patriots) looks to continue his dominant ways, as Justin Herbert's go-to target routinely has double-digit target potential.

Mike Evans (vs. Panthers) sits in our top five for Week 13, totaling four TDs over the past three weeks. A.J. Brown (vs. 49ers) faces a sound San Francisco coverage unit in Sunday's NFC Championship rematch, but his ability to dominate in the red zone still makes him a top-10 PPR play. Ja'Marr Chase (@ Jaguars) averaged over 20 yards per reception in Week 12, and although the drop-off from Joe Burrow to Jake Browning is massive, Chase still has WR1 upside given his usage.

Michael Pittman Jr. (@ Texans) faces a Texans' pass defense that's been shredded the past few weeks, so another 100-yard receiving day could be in store. Jaylen Waddle (@ Commanders) is also looking to post his second consecutive 100-plus yard day, which could come to fruition against a struggling Commanders' coverage unit. Tank Dell (vs. Broncos) continues to rise up our PPR rankings, rounding out our top 10 as a trusted option of C.J. Stroud's.

WEEK 13 FANTASY ADVICE: Sleepers | Busts | Projections | Start-sit

Who are the best fantasy WR sleepers, waiver pickups in Week 13?

Curtis Samuel (vs. Dolphins), Jayden Reed (vs. Chiefs), Lynn Bowden Jr. (vs. Lions), Jonathan Mingo (@ Buccaneers), Cedric Tillman (@ Rams), and DeVante Parker (vs. Chargers) profile as this week's crop of sleepers and waiver-wire adds.

Samuel saw a heavy dosage of targets in Week 12, and with Washington passing at a high clip, another high-usage day could be in store. Reed's scored in three straight games and while he has a higher ceiling in standard formats, he still has flex appeal in a potentially negative game script.

Bowden Jr., alongside A.T. Perry and Keith Kirkwood, are the only healthy Saints WRs right now, and a favorable matchup against Detroit gives each some flex value in deep leagues. Mingo also draws a plus matchup against a reeling Buccaneers secondary, as a potential negative game script should boost his Week 13 fantasy ceiling.

Tillman is another talented rookie who's getting more run as the season progresses, and although P.J. Walker's struggled under center, Tillman is set up for a high-usage day against the Rams with Amari Cooper (ribs) banged up.

WEEK 13 DFS:

DK lineup | FD lineup | Best stacks | Best values

Who are the biggest potential WR busts in Week 13?

Beware of Terry McLaurin (vs. Dolphins), Puka Nacua and Tutu Atwell (vs. Browns), Drake London (@ Jets), and Tyler Lockett and Jaxon Smith-Njigba (@ Cowboys) this week.

McLaurin's averaging just 42 receiving yards over his past three games, and a heavy dosage of Jalen Ramsey hinders his Week 13 fantasy value.

Nacua and Atwell see a Cleveland coverage unit who entered Week 12 allowing the fewest fantasy points per game to WRs. Heck, even Cooper Kupp, who hasn't looked like himself of late, could underperform again.

We can't trust London and the rest of the Falcons passing offense against a well-rounded Jets defense. To make matters worse, he'll be matched up against Sauce Gardner for most of the day, too.

Lockett and Smith-Njigba might be better suited for the bench in PPR leagues against a lockdown Dallas coverage unit. Geno Smith's struggles complicate their fantasy prospects, as well.

What are the biggest WR injuries in Week 13?

Entering Week 12, Tee Higgins (hamstring), Noah Brown (knee), Treylon Burks (concussion), and Kadarius Toney (ankle, hip) all failed to suit up due to nagging injuries. For now, we've placed Higgins and Brown in our Week 13 list and omitted Burks and Toney. We'll also be eyeing the Chargers' Josh Palmer (knee), who's eligible to come off the IR this week but probably won't suit up against New England.

Last week, the most notable WRs to exit their respective games with injuries include Chris Olave (concussion), Amari Cooper (ribs), Demario Douglas (concussion), and Rashid Shaheed (thigh). We've left all four WRs out of our initial Week 13 list but will closely monitor their teams' injury reports to gauge their playing prospects.

As usual, we'll update these WR PPR rankings throughout the week, so check back for the latest player movement and analysis.

sports,"Anthony Franco, MLB Trade Rumors",2023-11-13T23:16:32+00:00,"While the offseason has gotten rolling, trade season hasn’t quite arrived. The Tigers acquired Mark Canha from Milwaukee in the biggest swap of the first couple weeks. Otherwise, the GM Meetings simply served to set the stage for future transactions.

That’ll surely involve some notable trades. Unlike the summer deadline, projecting which players will change hands is difficult at this stage of the offseason.

Aside from the A’s, there aren’t any teams clearly in rebuild mode. Clubs like the Rockies, Royals, White Sox, Nationals and Angels have uphill paths to contention, yet none has indicated they’re prepared to punt on the 2024 season entirely.

The Padres, Twins, Rays, Brewers and Guardians are all aiming to contend but have questions about their payroll. That’s standard operating procedure for Tampa Bay, Milwaukee and Cleveland. San Diego and, to a lesser extent, Minnesota have shown a willingness to spend in recent years but are scaling back — in both cases, likely tied to their uncertain local television rights contracts.

That informs the offseason trade landscape, which is headlined by a few stars deep into their arbitration windows. Without many clear rebuilders, it’s possible we see more swaps of big leaguers at positions of need between teams that expect to compete.

Before we get to the list, a note on methodology. This isn’t a strict ranking of players’ trade value, nor is it solely about likelihood of being moved. We’re trying to balance both of those things, an inherently subjective exercise.

All projected salaries for arbitration-eligible players are courtesy of MLBTR contributor Matt Swartz.

1. Juan Soto, LF, Padres

Other than Shohei Ohtani’s free agency, there may be no bigger story of the offseason than Soto’s future in San Diego. He is entering his final year of club control, projected for a $33M salary that would be the highest ever for an arbitration-eligible player.

The Padres are scaling back payroll, perhaps as much as $50M. They need multiple starting pitchers and could stand to upgrade at first base and/or designated hitter.

Trading Soto would allow the Friars to recoup MLB-ready talent while clearing significant spending room for multiple smaller additions. It would also be a devastating blow to the lineup. Soto overcame a relatively slow start (by his standards) to hit .275/.410/.519 with 35 home runs this year.

The Padres are still motivated to win in the short term. Barring what would be a stunning run at Ohtani, they’re not going to acquire anyone better than Soto.

President of baseball operations A.J. Preller continues to maintain they’ll explore a long-term deal. There’s nothing to suggest an extension is particularly likely. Soto rejected a $440M offer from the Nationals before he was traded at the 2022 deadline. The price would only be higher now that he’s a year and a half closer to free agency.

In the absence of an extension or a definitive declaration that Soto is off the trade market, speculation will linger. Alden González of ESPN wrote last week that many throughout the industry believe the three-time All-Star will be available.

2. Corbin Burnes, SP, Brewers

3. Willy Adames, SS, Brewers

Burnes and Adames are tied together with good reason. They’re each one year from the open market and projected for a noteworthy arbitration salary — $15.1M for Burnes, $12.4M for Adames. Milwaukee is reportedly open to offers on the majority of the roster.

A former Cy Young winner, Burnes may be the best pitcher available in trade. The right-hander posted a sub-3.00 ERA each season from 2020-22. His 3.39 mark across 193 2/3 innings this past season wasn’t quite so dominant but is still high-end production.

Burnes struck out just under 26% of opposing hitters. While his lowest mark since his rookie season, that’s still an above-average figure.

Adames is coming off a less impressive year. The 28-year-old hit .217/.310/.407 through 638 trips to the plate. That’s slightly below-average offense, although he still connected on 24 home runs.

Adames is an excellent defensive shortstop with plus power in an offseason where there are essentially no free agent shortstops of note. Even with a mediocre on-base percentage, he’d generate plenty of interest.

4. Shane Bieber, SP, Guardians

Develop high-end starting pitching, trade a top starter as they become more expensive, replace him with talented younger arms. The Guardians have trodden this path with Corey Kluber, Mike Clevinger and Carlos Carrasco. Bieber, one year from free agency with a projected $12.2M salary, could be next.

Cleveland has the likes of Tanner Bibee, Gavin Williams, Logan Allen, Triston McKenzie and Cal Quantrill (himself a potential trade candidate) as rotation options. While Bieber is no longer a Cy Young caliber pitcher, he turned in a 3.80 ERA with a below-average but serviceable 20.1% strikeout rate over 21 starts this past season.

Bieber lost a good chunk of the second half to elbow inflammation but returned to make two appearances in late September.

5. Tyler Glasnow, SP, Rays

The Rays signed Glasnow to an extension in August 2022 when he was completing his rehab from Tommy John surgery. The big right-hander is set to make $25M next season, the largest single-year salary in franchise history.

That naturally leads to questions about whether the Rays are prepared to meet that figure, particularly in an offseason where they have a loaded arbitration class.

If they made him available — and he’s already surfaced in rumors — Glasnow would be a very appealing target. He was quite good this year, working to a 3.53 ERA while striking out more than a third of opponents over 21 starts. An oblique strain cost him the first two months of the season, but he avoided the injured list thereafter.

He’s a year away from free agency, making another extension with Tampa Bay appear unlikely. Yet dealing him would represent a tough blow to the Rays’ chances of competing in 2024. They’re already down Shane McClanahan for the entire season and will be without Jeffrey Springs and Drew Rasmussen for at least a good portion of the year.

While they’d likely bring back some kind of MLB help as part of a Glasnow trade return, the rotation depth could be a problem.

6. Dylan Cease, SP, White Sox

Cease had a disappointing follow-up to his Cy Young runner-up campaign. He allowed a 4.58 ERA over 177 innings this past season. That’s nearly two and a half runs higher than his sparkling 2.20 mark of the prior year. As is often the case, his true talent probably lies somewhere in the middle.

Cease still missed plenty of bats — 27.3% strikeout rate, 13.6% swinging strike percentage — while issuing a few more walks than ideal. His fastball averaged 95.6 mph, down a tick from the preceding season.

The right-hander has shown the ability to pitch at an ace-caliber level. He is two seasons from free agency and projected for an $8.8M arbitration salary, making him more affordable than the other high-end starting pitchers near the top of this list.

The extra year of control probably gives him more trade value than any of Burnes, Bieber or Glasnow. It also makes him less likely to be traded this offseason.

First-year GM Chris Getz has suggested no one on the roster is truly untouchable, an understandable approach for a team that just lost 101 games. Neither owner Jerry Reinsdorf nor Getz has called this a rebuild, though.

Any slim hopes the White Sox may have of competing in 2024 would be dashed by trading Cease, the only above-average starting pitcher on the roster.

7. Alex Verdugo, RF, Red Sox

Verdugo’s name has been floated in trade rumors for a few seasons. The Red Sox have held onto him thus far. They have a new baseball operations leader in Craig Breslow, who has acknowledged the team has gotten early calls on the left-handed hitting outfielder.

Jarren Duran and Masataka Yoshida also hit from the left side. Dealing Verdugo could free some at-bats for a right-handed addition while perhaps bringing in immediate help for the pitching staff or at second base.

MLBTR projects Verdugo for a $9.2M salary in his final season of arbitration. He’s coming off another league-average offensive showing, when he hit .264/.324/.421 with 13 home runs through 602 plate appearances.

Verdugo hasn’t become the All-Star player the Sox envisioned when building the Mookie Betts return around him. He’s a solid regular, a high-contact hitter who rates as a decent defender in right field.

8. Trent Grisham, CF, Padres

9. Ha-Seong Kim, 2B, Padres

If the Padres hold Soto, dealing Grisham and/or Kim could be an alternative means of trimming payroll. While neither is going to make anywhere near Soto money in 2024, they’re each on mid-level salaries of note.

Grisham is projected for a $4.9M salary in his second-to-last season of arbitration. Kim is slated for an $8M salary and will be due a $2M buyout on a 2025 mutual option at season’s end. He’ll be a free agent next winter.

Grisham has the extra year of control but is the worse player. He draws plenty of walks but has hit below the Mendoza line in two straight seasons. He’s coming off a .198/.315/.352 line over 555 plate appearances. The appeal is on the other side of the ball.

Grisham is an above-average defensive center fielder, keeping him as a low-end regular even if he’s best suited for the bottom of a lineup. San Diego could kick Fernando Tatis Jr. over to center field if they dealt Grisham, freeing right field for a bigger offensive threat than Grisham provides.

It’s a similar story with Kim. Dealing him would free Jake Cronenworth to move back to second base, opening first base for a better hitter. It’d be tough to replace Kim’s overall production, though. He’s a plus defender at multiple infield spots.

He hit .260/.351/.398 with 17 home runs and stole 38 bases in 152 games. Trading Kim isn’t as damaging to the lineup as a Soto deal would be, but it’d be tougher than parting with Grisham.

10. Gleyber Torres, 2B, Yankees

Another player one year from free agency, Torres is projected for a $15.3M salary in his last arbitration season. That’s below his market value but a notable figure for a bat-first second baseman — a general profile that the league has devalued in recent years.

Torres was New York’s second-best offensive player in 2023, hitting .273/.347/.453 with 25 homers through 672 trips to the plate.

Even if they’re not interested in an extension, New York could hold Torres for his final season of club control. They’re already light on consistent hitting beyond Aaron Judge. On the surface, trading their second-best hitter seems counterintuitive.

The big question is whether the front office believes Oswald Peraza is capable of stepping into an everyday second base role in 2024. If they feel the 23-year-old is ready, trading Torres to clear spending room while bringing back outfield or pitching help makes sense.

11. Jonathan India, 2B, Reds

The Reds’ infield surplus has fueled trade speculation on India back to the deadline. Cincinnati didn’t seem inclined to make that move midseason, pointing to India’s role as a clubhouse leader. While that’s certainly still a factor, he didn’t hit well down the stretch and finished the year with a middling .244/.338/.407 batting line. He’s a well below-average keystone defender.

There’s an argument the Reds are better off relying on an up-the-middle tandem of Matt McLain and either Noelvi Marte or Elly De La Cruz. Perhaps the offseason is a better time to consider moving India for a back-end starter.

The former Rookie of the Year is projected for a $3.7M salary and has three seasons of remaining arbitration control.

12. Eloy Jiménez, DH, White Sox

Jiménez no longer looks like a core piece for the White Sox. Various injuries have kept him off the field throughout his big league tenure. He only has two seasons of 100+ games and hasn’t gotten to 500 plate appearances since his 2019 rookie year.

Jiménez was still an excellent hitter when healthy as recently as 2022, when he ran a .295/.358/.500 line over 84 games. His production fell this year, as he posted a .272/.317/.441 slash with 18 homers over 489 trips to the dish.

That’s not especially imposing for a player who’s best suited at DH. Yet Jiménez has shown greater offensive upside that isn’t matched by many in this winter’s free agent class. If the Sox are prepared to move on, another team could look to buy low.

He’ll make a $13M salary next year, the final guaranteed season of his contract. He’s guaranteed a $3M buyout on a $16.5M club option for 2025 and the deal contains an $18.5M team option for the ’26 campaign.

13. Max Kepler, RF, Twins

14. Jorge Polanco , 2B, Twins

Minnesota president of baseball operations Derek Falvey has confirmed the team is paring back payroll. The Athletic’s Dan Hayes reported the organization could end in the $125M-140M range. At the moment, they have around $120M in projected spending.

The Twins have a few ways to clear room. Trading either Kepler or Polanco would accomplish that. The former is making $10M, while the latter is playing on a $10.5M deal. Kepler will be a free agent after next season; Polanco’s contract has a $12.5M team option for 2025 that comes with a $750K buyout.

They’re each good players. Kepler is a plus defender in right field who hit .260/.332/.484 with 24 homers this year. Polanco was limited to 80 games but ran a .255/.335/.454 showing. He’s one of the sport’s better offensive second basemen and saw some third base action for Minnesota late in the year.

The Twins have Matt Wallner and Trevor Larnach as left-handed hitting corner outfield options. They’re deeper on the infield, where Willi Castro and Kyle Farmer (another trade candidate) are possibilities at second/third base behind starters Edouard Julien and Royce Lewis.

Top prospect Brooks Lee, the No. 8 overall pick in 2022, isn’t far from MLB readiness. The Twins could look to move Kepler or Polanco for rotation depth or to bring in a righty bat to balance the lineup.

15. Randy Arozarena, LF, Rays

Arozarena hasn’t been the subject of the same level of trade speculation as Glasnow has. There’s an argument the Rays should be more willing to move the All-Star outfielder if they’re looking to create payroll room.

Tampa Bay has greater depth in the outfield than they do on their injury-riddled pitching staff. Josh Lowe, Jose Siri, Harold Ramírez, Luke Raley and Manuel Margot are all on hand. (Margot has come up in trade rumors as well.)

None of those players is as good as Arozarena. Trading star players for younger talent is familiar territory for the Tampa Bay front office though. Arozarena is projected for a $9M arbitration salary and controllable for three seasons. He’d have significant trade value if the Rays were to consider moving him.

16. Mariners SP

We initially had Bryan Woo in this spot. It could just as easily have been Bryce Miller or Emerson Hancock, so we’ll cheat and just mention the Seattle rotation in general.

They’re almost certainly not going to trade George Kirby. It’d take a lot to pry away Logan Gilbert. Moving any of Woo, Miller or Hancock could be more appealing for a front office that is looking for ways to add long-term offensive upside.

None of that trio has even reached one year of major league service. Hancock only has three big league starts under his belt. Miller and Woo spent more time in the rotation this year, starting 25 and 18 games respectively. They both turned in mid-rotation results.

Other clubs probably have differing opinions on which right-hander they prefer. (The Mariners likely have their own slight preferences.) They’d all have significant value if president of baseball operations Jerry Dipoto decided to move one for a bat.

17. Dylan Carlson, CF, Cardinals

It was a bit of a surprise that Carlson didn’t change hands over the summer. Various reports suggested the Cards were making him available as they looked for ways to add a controllable starter. It didn’t happen, but the same logic applies this winter.

Carlson has been surpassed by Lars Nootbaar as the starting center fielder. St. Louis needs multiple starting pitchers and will likely bring in at least one via trade. Carlson probably has less value than he did before the deadline. Not only did he finish with a mediocre .219/.318/.333 batting line, he underwent season-ending surgery on his left ankle in September.

There’d nevertheless be teams willing to take a shot on a former top prospect who looked like an average or better center fielder 12 months ago. Carlson is projected for a modest $1.8M salary and has three years of arbitration control.

18. Paul Blackburn, SP, A’s

Blackburn is arguably the most desirable realistic trade candidate on the Oakland roster. The A’s have torn things to the studs. They’re unlikely to compete within the two remaining years of Blackburn’s arbitration window. The right-hander (30 next month) worked to a 4.43 ERA with a decent 22.4% strikeout rate over 103 2/3 innings this past season.

He’s projected for a $3.2M salary. A Blackburn trade isn’t going to be an offseason defining move, but he has a good chance to be flipped to a contender seeking affordable back-end starting pitching.

19. Alek Manoah, SP, Blue Jays

Perhaps no player had a more disappointing 2023 performance than Manoah. Within one season, he went from Cy Young finalist to essentially unplayable. The right-hander pitched to a 5.87 ERA over 19 big league outings. His walks more than doubled while his strikeouts fell from 22.9% to a modest 19% clip.

He lost his spot in the Toronto rotation and was eventually demoted to the minors. Manoah never pitched in Triple-A and received an injection in his throwing shoulder at the end of the season.

How will the Jays proceed after that disastrous year? General manager Ross Atkins said last week the team would give him “a strong leg up” on the No. 5 spot in the rotation. The Jays aren’t broadcasting a desire to trade him, although they wouldn’t be doing themselves any favors if they declared they were ready to move on.

Dealing Manoah to bring in a lower upside but higher floor pitcher wouldn’t be a surprise with the Jays firmly in win-now mode. The former first-round pick is controllable for four more seasons and won’t reach arbitration until next winter.

20. Brandon Drury, 2B, Angels

The Halos signed Drury to a two-year free agent deal last winter. The righty-hitting infielder turned in a nice season, connecting on 26 home runs with a .262/.306/.497 line across 523 plate appearances. Next year’s $8.5M salary looks like strong value, particularly in an offseason where the supply of up-the-middle players is thin.

The Angels probably aren’t kicking off a rebuild. They could do a shorter-term retool if Ohtani walks, or they could simply look to move Drury for pitching while turning second base to Luis Rengifo and/or an external acquisition.

21. Brendan Donovan, 2B, Cardinals

Donovan is a longer shot trade possibility if the Cards move a controllable hitter for starting pitching. He’s more valuable than Carlson and less likely to be on the move.

At the same time, he’d net a clearer rotation upgrade if St. Louis were to give him up — likely turning the middle infield over to a combination of Tommy Edman, Nolan Gorman and Masyn Winn in that scenario.

The 26-year-old hit .284/.365/.422 with 11 homers through 371 plate appearances this past season. A flexor tendon injury pushed him to designated hitter and eventually required surgery that ended his year a couple months early. He’s expected back for spring training.

If healthy, Donovan brings excellent contact skills and a solid plate approach. He’s a multi-positional defender who can play any of the corners in addition to second base. Donovan has four years of remaining control and won’t get to arbitration until next offseason.

22. Christopher Morel, DH, Cubs

Morel is likely to be a divisive player around the league. He has huge raw power and connected on 26 home runs while slugging .508 in 107 games for the Cubs. The right-handed hitter owns a .241/.311/.471 line in just over 850 MLB plate appearances over the past two seasons. When he’s hot, he can carry a lineup.

He also strikes out more than 30% of the time and doesn’t have a defensive fit. Morel has played all three outfield spots and each of second base, third base and shortstop in the majors. He hasn’t rated well anywhere.

The Cubs used him mostly at designated hitter this year and have suggested they’ll get him first base run in 2024. That’s not a great fit for a plus runner with top-of-the-scale arm strength, yet Morel hasn’t shown himself capable of handling more important positions on a regular basis.

How teams project Morel defensively could impact both whether he’s traded and what kind of return the Cubs could receive. As a first baseman or DH, he’s a fringe regular with a statistical profile that’d paint him as a lumbering slugger as opposed to a dynamic athlete. If another team feels he can hold his own at second base or in center field, he becomes far more desirable.

The Cubs have no urgency to trade him. Morel is controllable through 2028 and won’t reach arbitration for at least another season. Yet president of baseball operations Jed Hoyer has alluded to the possibility of a deal, saying last week that “another team might be able to put him [at second base],” where the Cubs have Nico Hoerner.

23. Christian Vázquez, C, Twins

Trading Vázquez is another route Minnesota could consider to clear money. The Twins signed the veteran catcher to a three-year, $30M free agent deal last offseason. He had a tough first season in Minneapolis, limping to a .223/.280/.318 line over 355 plate appearances — albeit with his typical brand of excellent defense.

Ryan Jeffers easily surpassed him as the No. 1 option on the depth chart. A $10M per year backup catcher is a luxury for a team trying to trim salary.

Minnesota likely wouldn’t be able to offload the entire deal, but they could try to shed around half the money or take on a smaller contract in return.

Vázquez’s year wasn’t much worse than a season that got Omar Narváez two years and $15M last winter, while Tucker Barnhart secured a two-year, $6.5M guarantee despite a much lesser offensive track record.

24. Luis Robert Jr., CF, White Sox

Robert has the most trade value of any player on this list. He may also be the least likely to move. Last week, Getz called him a franchise building block and noted he had no plans to proactively shop Robert even as he left open the possibility of listening to offers on anyone.

It’s not hard to understand why. Robert’s an elite defensive center fielder who connected on 38 home runs while hitting .264/.315/.542. It was the first time he stayed healthy for a 162-game schedule. The result was a season that’ll get him down-ballot MVP support.

Robert is a prime-aged superstar and, unlike Soto or Burnes, he’s nowhere near free agency. He’ll make $12.5M next year, $15M in 2025 and is controllable via $20M team options for 2026-27. Trading Robert would signify a complete teardown that the Sox probably don’t want. Yet the haul would be astronomical if they decided to go in that direction.

25. Pete Alonso, 1B, Mets

Alonso was the subject of early offseason trade speculation. With the Mets projecting a less active offseason and placing a priority on 2025, it wasn’t out of the question he could be available. Alonso is projected for a $22M arbitration salary and will be a free agent after next year.

New York has subsequently walked back some of their statements about a possible retool. They’re still aiming to compete in ’24 even if they’re signaling they won’t blow away the top of the free agent market.

First-year president of baseball operations David Stearns has twice publicly said he anticipates Alonso being the Opening Day first baseman in Queens. That won’t stop teams from trying, but an offseason deal looks decidedly unlikely.

sports,Vinnie Iyer,2023-11-13T21:54:00+00:00,"Week 10 in the NFL had some of the league's best teams not playing. But that didn't stop the excitement, with five teams winning on walk-off field goals and more games coming right down to the wire.

With that, there were some surprising results and expected domination. Some favorites dug deep to win. Some underdogs turned in shocking upsets.

Putting the latest wins and losses into a blender, here's Sporting News' updated look at how all teams stack up against each other, 1-32 going into Week 11:

NFL WEEK 11 PICKS: Straight up | Against the spread

NFL power rankings Week 11

1. Philadelphia Eagles 8-1 (previous week: 1)

The Eagles enjoyed a bye trying to get a little healthier for the more difficult stretch run in a top-heavy NFC as they have tough games at the Chiefs (the Super Bowl 57 rematch), vs. the Bills, vs. 49ers and at the Cowboys in the next four. They still look like the conference team to beat as they have proved they still win in many ways around Jalen Hurts.

2. Kansas City Chiefs 7-2 (3)

The Chiefs had a pretty good week off given they jumped back into the AFC's top seed and home-field advantage spot with the Ravens losing. They already are rolling defensively and expect them to figure out a lot more around Patrick Mahomes after the key Andy Reid bye.

3. Detroit Lions 7-2 (5)

The Lions are becoming like the Eagles, and that's what makes them the second-best team in the NFC. They can win shootouts with Jared Goff, Amon-Ra St. Brown and their passing game. They also can dominate with the running game. They can win with offense or defense. Dan Campbell is coach of the year.

4. San Francisco 49ers 6-3 (8)

The 49ers had a surprise offensive get-well game in Jacksonville with Brock Purdy leading the way and all his key supporting weapons doing damage, even without Christian McCaffrey scoring. The biggest development was the defense going back to dominating a good offense.

5. Baltimore Ravens 7-3 (2)

The Ravens' offense is just fine with the running and passing of Lamar Jackson, but he still can't afford to make big mistakes, which he did vs. the Browns. The defense needs to pick up the pieces, too, stat, ahead of facing the Bengals on a short week.

6. Miami Dolphins 6-3 (6)

The Dolphins got a much-needed bye to figure out how to beat the better teams in the league. Their defense should be getting a little better to support their often explosive offense. They should feel good about a Week 11 rebound vs. the Raiders.

7. Pittsburgh Steelers 6-3 (9)

The Steelers are playing the way Mike Tomlin wants, with the running game rolling to big totals with Jaylen Warren and Najee Harris and the defense doing what it needs, more so vs. pass than run, in key moments. You can't argue with the overachieving results.

8. Cleveland Browns 6-3 (10)

The Browns proved they can win games with defense in another way, with big plays. They also have more offensive pop when Deshaun Watson plays well and the running game doesn't slump. Their playoff hopes look much better after their stunning comeback vs. the Ravens.

9. Jacksonville Jaguars 6-3 (4)

The Jaguars got an NFC wake-up call against the 49ers, who were much more prepared after a Week 9 bye than they were. Jacksonville needs to forget that debacle and get back on track, stat. The team gets a division double vs. Tennessee and Houston before facing Cincinnati.

10. Dallas Cowboys 6-3 (11)

The Cowboys took advantage of their ""no contest"" vs. the Giants at home with Dak Prescott continuing to ball as a passer and runner. They need to keep the defense and running game success, too, in bigger games going forward.

MORE: Inside the Cowboys historic offensive explosion vs. Giants

11. Seattle Seahawks 6-3 (13)

The Seahawks needed every ounce of their offense around Geno Smith to rally to beat the Commanders, but the get-well performance worked well for him, Kenneth Walker and the wide receivers. The defense could be more consistent.

12. Minnesota Vikings 6-4 (14)

The new man on the Vikings, Josh Dobbs, keeps producing the same results they were enjoying offensively with Kirk Cousins, thanks to more help from the running game for Kevin O'Connell and the defense overall under Brian Flores. Their 0-3 and 1-4 starts are distant memories as the Vikings look for a sixth straight win in Week 11 vs. Denver.

13. Houston Texans 5-4 (16)

The Texans are looking great with C.J. Stroud leading their offense and now they've found some running game, too. The defense is just making enough plays to put them in position to win high-scoring games. Houston is a legitimate playoff contender under rookie coach DeMeco Ryans.

14. Cincinnati Bengals 5-4 (7)

The Bengals are battling some key injuries, leaving them much less room for error. Unfortunately, Joe Burrow made key mistakes and the defense wilted against run and pass at home in the loss to the Texans.

15. Buffalo Bills 5-5 (12)

The Bills fell right into the trap game against the Broncos at home, losing because of more mistakes from Josh Allen. The defense can't tolerate those mistakes with all of its injuries.

16. Las Vegas Raiders 5-5 (22)

The Raiders are hot, having won two consecutive games for interim coach Antonio Pierce, bringing up flashbacks to the playoff push they made with Rich Bisaccia in 2021. They are right back in the AFC wild-card race with the Dolphins, Chiefs, Vikings ahead.

17. New Orleans Saints 5-5 (15)

The Saints will go into a bye not knowing what do at quarterback. with Derek Carr further hurting his right shoulder and needed to be checked for a concussion. Jameis Winston did provide a spark, too little too late at Minnesota. But the division lead is precarious with poor QB play overall.

19. Indianapolis Colts 5-5 (19)

The Colts stopped scoring at least 20 points in every game during their ugly, run-heavy victory in Germany vs. the Patriots. At least Jonathan Taylor is doing his normal things and the defense is playing well again while Gardner Minshew looks meh.

18. Los Angeles Chargers 4-5 (17)

The Chargers got well offensively with Justin Herbert, Keenan Allen and Austin Ekeler against the Lions. But the defense went back to crumbling vs. big pass plays and added wilting against the run. The pressure is right back on Brandon Staley with a trip to Green Bay next.

20. Tampa Bay Buccaneers 4-5 (23)

Baker Mayfield and the offense is back on track to move the ball well after a brief midseason slump. They're still not lighting it up, but the Bucs are back to playing smart complementary football with their defense rebounding and still might have found a long-term QB answer.

21. New York Jets 4-5 (18)

Aaron Rodgers can't come back soon enough, and going for a December miracle might be too late after two straight key losses to the Chargers and Raiders. Zach Wilson will always cap the potential of a talented offense that keeps making mistakes. The Bills and Dolphins in back-to-back division games next might be their season.

22. Denver Broncos 4-5 (24)

The Broncos got another big win against a AFC power, sandwiching their Week 9 bye with upsets over the Chiefs and Bills. The offense has hit a balanced grooved with Russell Wilson and the defense is making a lot more plays, too.

23. Washington Commanders 4-5 (21)

The Commanders should be pleased about Sam Howell and the offense showing more fight with additional weapons and the running backs look better all-around again. But the reeling defense and pass protection continue to be un-winnable assets.

24. Atlanta Falcons 4-5 (20)

The Falcons were forced into another QB change because of injury. They found a few more answers offensively but that position still made it an overall mess. The defense also doesn't seem to be well prepared to different styles of offenses.

25. Green Bay Packers 3-6 (25)

The Packers saw some improved work from Jordan Love and his young weapons as they spread the ball well in the passing game, but the run defense woes and key holes in coverage have all but doomed their playoff hopes.

26. Los Angeles Rams 3-6 (26)

The Rams are hoping to find a few more answers during a bye, as Sean McVay has seen his good coaching job earlier in the season go by the wayside with key offensive injuries. They need Matthew Stafford to help save face the rest of the way or the season will look a lot like 2022.

27. Tennessee Titans 3-6 (27)

Will Levis is going through rookie lumps after his dazzling debut as the brutal offensive line woes exacerbated by injuries are getting to him and the entire Titans offense. The Titans still need to keep starting him, because they can't overcome those systemic problems or those in overall pass defense.

28. Chicago Bears 3-7 (29)

The Bears don't care how they win, but they should be pleased their running game and defense bailed out their limited passing game with Tyson Bagent to secure another win in Week 10. They will hope to finish strong with Justin Fields soon.

29. Arizona Cardinals 2-8 (32)

The Cardinals got an immediate spark for their offense with Kyler Murray and James Conner back. They also seemed invigorated for Jonathan Gannon on defense and special teams. Look for the Cardinals to finish strong and play a whole lot of spoiler.

30. New England Patriots 2-8 (28)

The Patriots tried to win a game by hiding Mac Jones and their quarterbacks in general. They almost pulled it off with the running game dominating and short-handed defense making a lot of plays, but they didn't see the results in Germany ahead of a tough bye for Bill Belichick.

31. New York Giants 2-8 (30)

The Giants can just flush away this season without Daniel Jones and Tyrod Taylor. The injuries go to their offense early and remained relentless, and now their defense is falling apart, too. The question is, will Brian Daboll get a massive mulligan after his rookie playoff leadership?

sports,Edward Sutelan,2023-12-03T23:24:00+00:00,"MLB's winter meetings are always a prime time for moves to happen as many of the top executives, players and agents all come together at the same spot.

Last year's winter meetings wound up being explosive. Aaron Judge, Justin Verlander, Trea Turner and Xander Bogaerts all came away with new contracts.

This year's winter meetings could wind up being similarly busy. There is a growing sense Shohei Ohtani could sign during the winter meetings, and a move of that magnitude could kick off the next wave of moves. There's also a number of top players on the trade market, including star Padres outfielder Juan Soto.

Starting Sunday, Dec. 3, and running through Wednesday, Dec. 6, expect MLB's offseason to really kick into high gear.

It has been expected since before he hit free agency that Ohtani would set the record for the largest fully guaranteed contract in North American sports history, with Passan reporting the deal could reach as much as $600 million.

Who will hand him that contract has been much more of a mystery. Little has been leaked about the top suitors for Ohtani beyond the usual suspects. Passan reported that at least three teams initially believed to be in the running — the Mets, Rangers and Red Sox — are believed to be out now.

Much of the rest of the names on the trade market are arms.

sports,Brad Cox,2023-12-06T23:27:00+00:00,"Manchester United got themselves back to winning ways thanks to a superb Scott McTominay brace against Chelsea.

The victory remarkably puts them within three points of rivals Manchester City, after the reigning champions were defeated by Aston Villa, and keeps them in reach of the top four places.

McTominay is now United's top scorer for the season with six goals, one ahead of Bruno Fernandes and Rasmus Hojlund. The Red Devils' captain had a first-half penalty saved by Robert Sanchez and United's Danish striker was substituted after another Premier League game without a goal, despite making 11 appearances.

Erik ten Hag's side were dominant in the first half and finally pounced on Chelsea's inability to take control in midfield. Mauricio Pochettino's men attempted to break at pace but Sofyan Amrabat made a vital interception and Fernandes found Alejandro Garnacho out wide. The youngster then cut the ball back to Harry Maguire whose effort rebounded perfectly into the path of McTominay. The Scotland international took one touch before blasting past Sanchez.

United led for the majority of the first 45 minutes but failed to build on their lead and were pegged back by the former Manchester City man, Cole Palmer. The 21-year-old, who made the transfer from the Etihad Stadium to Stamford Bridge in August, stroked the ball into the far corner with deadly accuracy. It was his fifth Premier League goal of the season and his first from open play.

But United continued to put Chelsea under pressure in the second half and after numerous attempts, McTominay headed powerfully past Sanchez. The Scotsman had seven shots, his most ever in a league game. Despite a flurry of late attacks driven by Reece James, Ten Hag's team stood strong and held on to see out the victory.

United have now won their past 19 Premier League games at Old Trafford when scoring first, including all 16 under their Dutch manager.

Ten Hag: Crisis? What crisis?

The United manager faced a demanding week amid reports indicating disunity within his team and his players did exceptionally well to block out the noise and focus on footballing matters.

When asked about a potential crisis, he said: “Crisis? Not for us. We keep calm. We know where we have to build. We are going in the right direction. This team is capable to be successful.”

And United were successful tonight, thanks to McTominay. Ten Hag explained how his midfielder has managed to become more involved in an attacking sense this season: ""He has a very good smell when to arrive and a very good finish.

""It is not a frustration, in the end, we won but we could have made our lives much easier,"" he said. ""We started very good, proactive, brave, we created a lot of chances in that moment, we could have gone up with two or three goals.""

Man United vs Chelsea live updates, highlights from Premier League

FT: United can breathe a sigh of relief and hold onto a crucial three points!

90th minute: Broja hits the post! That was so close to the equaliser for Chelsea. There are four minutes of added time.

80th minute: Garnacho so nearly makes it 3-1 to United but his delicately finish toys with the goalline.

74th minute: An insane recovery run and block by Reece James denies Garnacho from doubling United's lead. He was picked out superbly by Onana to kickstart a rapid counter by the hosts.

70th minute: GOAL! 2-1 United! And it's McTominay who has a brace! It's a great ball to the back post by Garnacho and McTominay meets the header from inside the six-yard box. He's in terrific goalscoring form and becomes United's top scorer this season.

69th minute: Antony tries one of his trademark curling efforts from the right after cutting in on his left but it's wide of the goal.

62nd minute: Penalty appeal for United! Shaw rockets an attempt goalwards and it looked as though Colwill may have blocked it with his hand. VAR took a quick look and play continues.

61st minute: Antony's trivela is deflected for a corner, it may have been going wide.

54th minute: Unfortunately for Garnacho, lightning doesn't strike twice. His latest acrobatic effort is well wide of the goal.

49th minute: Jackson has a glorious chance at the back post to make it 2-1 but he can't keep his header down!

46th minute: Both sides make a change at the break. Sergio Reguilon comes on for Lindelof and much to the delight of the Chelsea fans, Reece James comes on for Cucurella.

HT: That's all from a hectic first half, hopefully more of it to come in the second!

45th minute: GOAL! 1-1! The former City man finds the bottom corner with a delicate stroke past Onana. It's a wonderful goal from Cole Palmer to pull level right before the break.

36th minute: And that should be the equaliser! Mudryk finds himself in the box on his weak foot but the Chelsea forward drags his effort wide.

32nd minute: McTominay should have his second! Fernandes picks him out beautifully from the left but the Scotsman heads directly at Sanchez. Either side of the Chelsea goalkeeper and United would have a two-goal lead.

25th minute: Penalty appeal for Chelsea! Sterling drops to the floor after very minimal contact with Victor Lindelof but neither the referee nor VAR buy his theatrics.

19th minute: GOAL! 1-0 United! Scott McTominay finishes off a scrappy period of play and United have a deserved lead.

18th minute: Silva's block denies Antony the opener. He's not scored at Old Trafford since his debut...

15th minute: It's all gone a bit wild here as neither side appears to have a midfield capable of dictating the play. Chelsea have just had two glorious chances but Mudryk couldn't beat Onana and Fernandes made a brilliant recovery run to prevent the other attack.

9th minute: SAVED! It's a woeful penalty from Fernandes and Sanchez makes an easy diving save to his right.

7th minute: PENALTY! It's United who are rewarded for their bright start as Antony was brought down by Enzo Fernandez in the box. Chris Kavanagh originally waved play on, however, VAR instructed him to take a look at the monitor and the referee gives the penalty.

4th minute: Sanchez makes a great save to deny Hojlund the opener, who was well found by Luke Shaw.

3rd minute: Dalot picks out Fernandes on the edge of the box who blasts well over the bar with a first-time strike.

1st minute: The visitors get us underway.

15 mins until kickoff: The teams have headed down the tunnel here at the Theatre of Dreams and kickoff is next...

30 mins until kickoff: The warm-ups are underway at Old Trafford on a chilly night. Ten Hag has just told MUTV that Chelsea do not ""like to defend"" and that United must take advantage of that this evening.

45 mins until kickoff: Raheem Sterling has failed to score in any of his 24 matches against Man United. Could tonight be the ex-Liverpool and Man City player's night?

1 hour until kickoff: Team news is in! The eyebrow-raising decision from Erik ten Hag is that Marcus Rashford starts from the bench. Mauricio Pochettino starts the former Man City man, Cole Palmer.

1 hour 30 mins until kickoff: Chelsea have won three of their last four Premier League away games but are without a league win at Old Trafford since 2013...

2 hours until kickoff: It's been a relatively busy start to the week off the pitch for Erik ten Hag, it's time to see what happens on it.

They need not only to somehow turn their horrendous form around to win all four of their remaining matches, including an upcoming date with table-toppers and tournament favourites India, but also to hope numerous other results, including Australia to lose at least two and probably three of its own four games, to reach the knockout stage.

As expected, the reaction from the UK, and from a swathe of English cricket greats, was scathing.

Leading the charge was the always outspoken Sir Geoff Boycott, who wrote in The Telegraph that the team were paying the price for poor preparation in the lead-up to the World Cup, as well as shoddy team selection extending back to The Ashes earlier this year.

“It is an old saying: “By failing to prepare, you prepare to fail”,” Boycott wrote.

“History shows that England rarely bat well in India where the ball spins. Our guys are okay on flat pitches but if it turns they have a problem.

“So the best way to try and overcome that would have been for our squad of players to get to India early and play four or five warm-up matches. What did England do?

Plan only two warm-up games with one getting rained off. Not smart planning… batting and bowling against stiff opponents sharpens your game and puts you on your mettle. Against Sri Lanka, they were once again exposed.

“Too many of our guys just want to play crash, bang wallop all the time irrespective of the type of pitch or opposition. Again not smart.”

The brunt of Boycott’s criticism of England’s team composition was directed at the continued struggles of Jonny Bairstow, who has averaged just 25.2 this tournament, and all-rounder Chris Woakes, whose nightmare campaign continued against Sri Lanka with figures of 0/30 from six overs and a fourth-ball duck.

“Bairstow has struggled since his horrific injury [breaking his leg 12 months ago],” Boycott wrote.

“I have said before I believe Jonny came back too soon and was short of fitness and match practice. In the recent five Ashes Tests his keeping at Lord’s was poor with missed chances and he made only three significant batting scores out of nine innings. That shortage of runs has carried over to his patchy one day performances.

“Chris Woakes is an excellent bowler of swing and seam on English type pitches. His record abroad is poor as he does not have the pace or guile for flat batting surfaces. It is not the lad’s fault. He was selected but how could people picking the squad go against all the statistics.”

However, Boycott isn’t blaming captain Jos Buttler for the team’s woes, saying the skipper has an impossible job pulling together a ‘dysfunctional squad of players’ and that not even a ‘miracle man’ would have much of a prayer of salvaging any pride from the wreckage in India.

“Too many people are criticising the captaincy of Buttler and judging him against the captaincy of Eoin Morgan when England won the World Cup four years ago,” he wrote.

“Morgan’s England team was a finely tuned machine with everyone knowing their role and most of them at the top of their form… all Morgan had to do was pull the strings of a great unit of cricketers and he did it well, but my Mum could have captained that lot.

“On the other hand Jos has a dysfunctional squad of players. Poorly selected, poorly prepared, not a settled team, many not sure of their roles, patchy form, confidence wobbly and to cap it all England’s best two and most influential white-ball players have not been available.”

Boycott’s voice was added to by former England Test captains Nasser Hussain and Michael Atherton, who have both decried the sudden decline of the team’s previously dominant white-ball set-up, having entered the World Cup as reigning ODI and T20I champions.

Hussain said post-match on Sky Sports that “back to back, I’ve not seen England play as badly as that”, adding that the team’s issues are less to do with the frequently-criticised The Hundred or a lack of 50-over cricket in the build-up to the tournament as it is the sudden and collective loss of form of the English batting order.

“If you walk in that dressing room now and asked them to put their hand on their heart and say, are you in good nick? I reckon maybe one or two could say that,” Hussain said, later doubling down with a scathing editorial in the Daily Mail.

“They have all collapsed as a unit and their form has deserted them. Compare that to South Africa and their batting lineup, everyone’s in nick. You look at India and their batting lineup, Rohit [Sharma], KL Rahul, Virat Kohli, Shubman Gill – all in nick.

“Some of those cricketers on that park today would go in your best ever England white ball XI. It’s just been a bridge too far for most of them.

“What I don’t like is giving players a cop out… when we win the 50-over World Cup and the 20-over World Cup, aren’t they great? We’re brilliant. And when the wheels come of it’s the structure. It’s the structure of English cricket, we’re a disgrace.

“We play 20-over cricket, we play 100-ball cricket, we don’t play enough 50-over cricket – how much 50-over cricket domestically has Virat Kohli played? Or Heinrich Klaasen or anyone out here?

“That’s what’s made this great side over the last six years, travelling round the world playing T20 franchises. It’s such a lame excuse.”

Atherton described the England players as looking ‘dazed and shell-shocked, unable to comprehend what has befallen them’, and wrote in The Times that the Sri Lankan defeat officially represented the ‘end of an era’ for English white-ball supremacy.

“Each defeat, now four in five matches, has chipped away at the confidence of a group of players at the end of a cycle,” Atherton wrote.

“No batsman looks in any kind of form. Every player has been used; some discarded and used again. They lost faith in their all-rounder strategy before the South Africa match, making three changes, and then went back to it here, making three more.

“Players sense uncertainty in decision-making – and there has been a lot of uncertainty.

“It was hard to think that they could put in a worse performance than in Mumbai but they managed it with the bat in Bengaluru.”

Speaking after the match, Buttler admitted his team had been ‘short of our best by a very long way’, saying there is ‘no clear answer’ as to how to turn their fortunes around.

“It’s incredibly tough, an incredibly disappointing tournament. As captain, you feel that a lot,” he said.

“We’ve been short of our best by a very long way. I’m disappointed for myself and the boys that we’ve not given a good account of ourselves… if there was one golden nugget that we’re not doing then we’d pick that up.”

sports,Brian Campbell,2023-12-23T21:01:30+00:00,"They might not be fighting each other this weekend in Saudi Arabia but Anthony Joshua and Deontay Wilder each enter separate tests on Saturday that could be the final hurdle before seeing the former heavyweight champions finally share the same ring in early 2024.

Joshua (26-3, 23 KOs) welcomes former title challenger Otto Wallin (26-1, 14 KOs) in the main event of a blockbuster pay-per-view card dubbed ""The Day of Reckoning"" from Kingdom Arena in Riyadh (live on DAZN beginning at 11:30 a.m. ET --subscribe now). Wilder (43-2-1, 42 KOs), meanwhile, returns from a 14-month layoff to face former champion Joseph Parker (33-3, 23 KOs) in the co-main event as Saudi Arabia continues to pour money into the sport of boxing to make the kind of fights that have been difficult in the past.

Considering the 34-year-old Joshua, who lost his trio of titles to Oleksandr Usyk in 2021, has been linked to talks of a fight against Wilder, 38, dating back to when both first became titleholders in 2015, the prospect of them fighting in March, in the first of a rumored two-fight deal, is incredibly exciting.

That doesn't mean it's difficult not to ask the knee-jerk question most boxing fans are thinking: After such a long build toward this seemingly inevitable fight, why not just pair them together now?

Eddie Hearn of Matchroom Sport, Joshua's long-time promoter, cut right to the chase during a recent interview with ""Morning Kombat,"" referencing how hastily this weekend's card was assembled after months of rumors that the two heavyweights could appear on the same card.

""I think we had six weeks and the card was put together quickly,"" Hearn said. ""By the way, I think Otto Wallin is a very dangerous fight six weeks out. [Joshua] is in there with a southpaw who is just coming off a victory over [former cruiserweight titleholder Murat] Gassiev. And Joseph Parker is full of confidence and Wilder has been out for a long time.

""But, look, the reason they are fighting on the same card and the reason we are all going to Saudi Arabia is that we want to make Joshua and Wilder in Saudi Arabia. But everybody wants that fight to happen and if they both win on [Saturday] there is a great chance that you see what I think is the biggest fight in boxing.""

The main problem with marination in boxing over the past few decades is that placing big-name fighters into bouts they could lose -- which is the case for both Joshua and Wilder, despite each being sizable betting favorites -- has proven to be a major mistake because of upsets. In this case, neither Joshua nor Wilder are champions, so it's possible that the fights against each other still take pace, regardless of defeat, simply due to the sizable investment from Saudi Arabia.

""I think a win makes it look great on paper for both of us [in terms of] fighting each other,"" Wilder said during Monday's ""Morning Kombat"" interview. ""But it's no added pressure on my end. Maybe for Joshua, there's more pressure for him than I because I know what I'm coming to do. I'm blessed with God-given power and it's natural. There is nothing I have to inject my body with. There is no type of contaminated meat that I have to eat to make me feel some kind of way. I don't have to alter my gloves in any way, it's all natural to me.""

After coming up empty in the final two fights of his trilogy with Tyson Fury, both of which ended via violent stoppage, Wilder sat out a full year before returning last October to knock out Robert Helenius in Round 1. Wilder went on to enjoy a bit of a spiritual rebirth after attending an Ayahuasca retreat in South America and has been noticeably happier as a result.

This is a far cry from the more combative side of Wilder that shared more than a few conspiracy theories as to why he lost to Fury, and even fired co-trainer Mark Breland for throwing in the towel to save Wilder from further punishment in his 2020 Fury rematch.

""My mindspace is in a wonderful place. It's in an over-happy place,"" Wilder said. ""I'm always smiling nowadays. It's a joy to be able to enjoy life. Life passes us by so quickly because we are living in borrowed time, nothing is promised. You have to enjoy every moment.""

Joshua, the global star from the United Kingdom, has also traversed a difficult road mentally from his pair of title losses to Usyk, which triggered yet another trainer change and more than a few bizarre interviews where Joshua has appeared defensive and agitated. He recently attended a darkness retreat where he spent four days alone in a pitch black room in isolation.

The troubles for Joshua appear to link all the way back to his 2019 upset loss to late replacement Andy Ruiz Jr. at New York's Madison Square Garden, which came as part of a much-publicized U.S. debut. Even though Joshua would regain his titles in their immediate rematch, as Ruiz came to Saudi Arabia in obese physical shape, he has been undergoing a bit of an identity crisis as a boxer in the aftermath, even with a pair of 2023 rebound victories over Jermaine Franklin and Helenius (who also fought Joshua as a late replacement).

""This is just purely about doing the right thing and being 100 percent perfect every second that I am in that ring,"" Joshua told CBS Sports. ""That way I will be victorious and victory will come by knockout if I carry out my plan A, B and C; it will lead me to the KO.

""Otto Wallin is a southpaw so he's very tricky. We have to be very clever. He has a character that is very resilient, as we saw against Tyson Fury. He can box off the back foot and come forward so it's going to be a good challenge for us because he's a complete fighter.""

Wallin, a 33-year-old native of Sweden, is considered much more a live dog than Parker. Standing only half of an inch shorter than Joshua's 6-foot-6 frame, Wallin is a southpaw whose reputation was extremely bolstered in 2019 when he lost a title shot against Fury despite opening up a cut that required 47 stitches above Fury's eye and came close to giving Wallin a stoppage win.

The 33-year-old Parker, a New Zealand native who lost his WBO title to Joshua in their 2018 unification bout, is younger than Wallin but not considered as big of a threat to upset Wilder due to the gap in punching power between them. Still, Parker is an experienced boxer who owns wins over Ruiz, Hughie Fury and Derek Chisora. And despite a reputation damaging stoppage loss to Joe Joyce in 2022, has had plenty of experience in recent years under head trainer Andy Lee in the camp of Tyson Fury, who was 2-0-1 in this three fights with Wilder.

""Tyson has been very helpful and has given good advice,"" Parker told CBS Sports on Monday. ""[Andy Lee and I] came up with a good plan and have leaned on Tyson for a bit of advice. The big difference is that I don't have the same height and reach [as Fury]. But my strengths are different to his strengths and I will use mine to the best of my ability.

""You will see on fight night, I'm going to put on the best performance. I'm going to be quick and I'm going to be fast and I'm going to be punching with a lot of power. I'm going to be deliberate and I'm going to smash his face.""

The undercard is loaded up with other top heavyweights looking to make a splash and stay in title contention as Tyson Fury and Oleksandr Usyk prepare to crown an undisputed champion in early 2024. A win on Saturday for any of these men could put them in line for a shot at one of the four recognized titles at some time next year.

Predictions

Although the rest of Saturday's super card features recognized names, including 2022 fighter of the year Dmitry Bivol, the majority of matchups are one-sided on paper. Luckily for fans, both Wilder and Joshua have signed up for fights they could very well lose.

Yet, given the amount of money at stake in the pending two-fight series between the two, and the lack of finishing power from both Wallin and Parker, it's more likely things go to plan for the big-money investors who have spared no expenses to not only make the event happen but continue Saudi Arabia's plans to be a new global hub for big-time combat sports events.

Even with the layoff, Wilder has the power and conditioning to eventually catch Parker, even if the former champion is able to outbox Wilder leading up to a possible late stoppage. For as much as Wilder often gets criticized for his technical disadvantages, despite being a former U.S. Olympic bronze medalist, he has long shown the patience to make opponents pay for even the slightest mistake late in a bout.

Joshua, on the other hand, will likely have to work harder. He committed too much to being a boxer in both losses to Usyk, when playing the role of physical and mauling puncher could've been a more sound strategy. And was both passive and boring for the majority of his fight against Helenius before delivering a perfect knockout blow that reminded fans of his power and natural finishing skills.

As long as Joshua commits to playing the role of the bigger man, it's likely he does enough to take a decision. The same result that would be difficult to see Wallin get the nod for winning unless he does so in dominant fashion given the financial commitment that region has given to employing Joshua's services as a global star.

While it may be a bit more of a dicey walk for Joshua than Wilder on this day, both bouts are expected to be competitive.

Palmer left City for Chelsea in a deal worth around $A82 million in September and showed supreme composure to fire past Ederson in the dying stages.

Rodri had looked like securing a win for Pep Guardiola’s team with a deflected effort with four minutes left of regulation time.

But referee Anthony Taylor pointed to the spot when Ruben Dias slid into substitute Armando Broja in the box and, after a delay, Palmer swept his shot into the corner to stop City moving three points clear at the top.

Chelsea had dented Tottenham’s title ambitions with a wild 4-1 win against Ange Postecoglou’s team on Monday and proved a challenge for City, too, by coming back from behind three times.

City lead the table on 28 points with Liverpool going into second on 27, above Arsenal on goal difference. Tottenham are fourth on 26 after successive defeats.

Erling Haaland fired City ahead from the penalty spot in the 25th after VAR adjudged Marc Cucurella to have fouled the Norwegian.

Thiago Silva evened the score four minutes later with a header from Conor Gallagher’s corner.

Another former City player, Raheem Sterling, put Chelsea 2-1 up in the 37th by tapping in Reece James’ cross after a sweeping attack,

The score was even again in first-half stoppage time when Bernardo Silva crossed for Manuel Akanji to head in.

City re-took the lead two minutes after the break, with Haaland scoring again — sliding in to convert from close range.

Chelsea boss Mauricio Pochettino said: “That is why we always say the Premier League is the best in the world. We want to do something special here and this is how we need to play. We scored four goals against the best team in the world. It’s good to go into the international break like this.

“The approach of the game was good. We were brave. That is the idea of football. I am so proud and happy. The players never gave up. The reaction of the players was amazing.”

Pochettino struggled to stay composed during the game and apologised for his behaviour.

“Maybe I crossed the limit because I was emotional on the touchline. I want to apologise to everyone and the referee. It’s trying to help and encourage the players to keep going. We faced an amazing team.”

City coach Pep Guardiola said the scoreline was a fair reflection of the game.

“The Premier League has quality players with the ability to drive the ball from deep. I’m happy for the result. We were close. I think it’s a fair result. We were controlled enough.

“I always have to think about what we can do to get better. It’s not going to happen that we come here and win 7-0. They are trying to rebuild. We have no complaints.”

He described the midfield battle as “like chess. They had Enzo, Gallagher and Caicedo. They are so dangerous. Liverpool couldn’t do it. They were much better than Arsenal. It’s Chelsea. They have speed, physicality and a bench. We go into the international break top of the league and I didn’t expect that after the Arsenal defeat.”

While Tottenham are now fourth, two points adrift, City are just a point clear of second-placed Liverpool, who beat Brentford 3-0 with Mohamed Salah continuing his remarkable Anfield scoring record with two more goals to bring up his 200th in English football.

sports,Dan Treacy,2023-10-22T23:28:04+00:00,"Deion Sanders once said, “If you look good, you feel good, and if you feel good, you play good."" The Eagles looked good on Sunday night, donning Kelly Green jerseys and helmets for their matchup with the Dolphins.

And their play absolutely matched the look.

Philadelphia rolled to a 31-17 win over Miami on ""Sunday Night Football,"" keeping the Dolphins' offense off the scoreboard in the second half and playing smart football every step of the way down the stretch.

The Dolphins quickly made up a 17-3 deficit, scoring a touchdown just before halftime and finding the end zone again in the third quarter when Jerome Baker intercepted a deflected pass from Jalen Hurts for a pick-six.

The defining series of the game came right after the pick-six when Hurts shrugged off the turnover and led a surgical touchdown drive. After the Eagles' defense clamped down on Tagovailoa and the Dolphins, the offense pieced together a touchdown drive spanning nearly seven minutes to ice the game.

A.J. Brown overcame a slow start and shined for the Eagles, posting 137 yards and a touchdown in the win. Brown has now ripped off five consecutive games of at least 125 yards and seems to be on his way to a career-best season.

Hurts, Brown and the Eagles have higher goals than just individual success, and a win over one of the AFC's best teams is one way to make a statement. Philadelphia moves to 6-1, while the Dolphins miss a chance to open up a two-game lead in the AFC East and fall to 5-2 ahead of a matchup with the Patriots.

11:16 p.m. — And that'll do it. The Eagles finish strong and get back on track with an impressive win over the Dolphins.

11:12 p.m. — D'Andre Swift goes 22 yards for a first down, so the Eagles will simply kneel it the rest of the way.

11:09 p.m. — The Eagles take over on downs and will have the chance to just run out the clock on Miami.

11:07 p.m. — Tagovailoa is sacked on back-to-back plays, and this game has quickly spiraled for the Dolphins. It's 4th & 10.

11:00 p.m. TOUCHDOWN — Kenneth Gainwell hits the Dolphins with the spin move and likely ices this game! The Eagles lead 31-17 with just under five minutes remaining.

10:58 p.m. — The Eagles might've just hit the Dolphins with the dagger. Hurts goes downfield and hits A.J. Brown for a huge 42-yard gain. Philadelphia is knocking on the door after a long, long drive.

10:55 p.m. — The Brotherly Shove works AGAIN. It wasn't close, either. The Eagles are churning away, soaking up valuable time.

10:53 p.m. — Hurts' sneak is a success, as usual. The Eagles have a fresh set of downs.

10:52 p.m. — It's 4th & 1, but it looks like the Eagles will go for it deep in their own territory. It's a risk, even with the Brotherly Shove at their disposal.

10:47 p.m. INTERCEPTION — The Dolphins have been impressive on third down tonight, but not that time. Tagovailoa's pass to Mostert is picked off by Darius Slay, and Miami's defense suddenly has to meet the moment to keep this game within one possession.

10:44 p.m. — You think the Dolphins are happy to have Waddle back on the field? He rescues Miami's drive with a first down catch on 3rd & 12.

End of third quarter: Eagles 24, Dolphins 17

Dolphins 17, Eagles 17

10:23 p.m. TOUCHDOWN — Watch out! Kader Kohou deflects a pass from Hurts and it's returned by Jerome Baker for a touchdown. That's a pick six, and the Dolphins have tied the game just like that after the no-call.

10:22 p.m. — This looks more obvious than a certain penalty on James Bradberry from February.

10:20 p.m. — James Bradberry appears to get ahold of Cedrick Wilson's face mask on 4th & 3, but no flag flies. The Dolphins turn it over on downs.

10:19 p.m. — Tyreek Hill just can't hang onto what would've been a big-time catch. It's not a fumble, but it is a fourth down for the Dolphins. They'll go for it.

10:16 p.m. — Raheem Mostert is running wild. He rips off back-to-back runs of 21 and 15 yards, respectively, and the Dolphins are deep into Eagles territory just like that.

10:11 p.m. — The Eagles manage only one first down on the drive, and the Dolphins have a chance to get pretty strong field position after Philadelphia's first punt of the night.

10:10 p.m. — Zach Sieler gets to Hurts and takes him down for a loss of three yards.

10:06 p.m. — The Eagles will be backed up deep in their own territory to start the next drive, but it's a big opportunity for Hurts and co. to stretch the lead back to two possessions.

10:05 p.m. — Miami will punt from just past midfield, after a drive that started with some promise.

10:04 p.m. — The Dolphins face 3rd & 18, largely the result of a holding penalty. Tagovailoa has already converted one of these tonight.

10:01 p.m. — Raheem Mostert has struggled to get going, but he takes the Dolphins into Eagles territory with a solid 7-yard gain.

10:00 p.m. — Hill picks up where he left off and goes 17 yards to give this Dolphins drive an early spark.

End of first half: Eagles 17, Dolphins 10

9:45 p.m. — Any hope the Eagles had of doing something before halftime ends with a Jaelan Phillips sack of Hurts. Philadelphia will go to halftime up 17-10.

9:43 p.m. — Hill is up to 65 yards on eight catches. No other Dolphins receiver has more than two catches, and Hill now has 879 yards on the season.

Eagles 17, Dolphins 10

9:39 p.m. TOUCHDOWN — Tagovailoa hits Hill in the end zone for a touchdown! Hill was facing double coverage but simply beat both defenders. Miami has the deficit back to one possession.

9:38 p.m. — Rookie Nolan Smith sacks Tagovailoa with 44 seconds remaining in the half.

9:37 p.m. — The Dolphins are down to the Eagles' 29-yard line after catches by Braxton Berrios and Tyreek Hill. They have a chance to score on back-to-back possessions, as they get the ball out of halftime.

9:33 p.m. TWO-MINUTE WARNING — Woah! Tagovailoa rescues a Dolphins drive that was headed in the wrong direction with a 29-yard pass to Cedrick Wilson. Great job by Wilson to keep both feet in after the grab.

9:30 p.m. — Jaylen Waddle walked back to the locker room and is questionable to return with a back injury. Major blow for the Dolphins.

9:23 p.m. — What a fourth down play for the Eagles! Hurts comes under heavy pressure but gets away and finds A.J. Brown for what was initially called a touchdown. Instead, Philadelphia will be at the goal line looking to take a 17-3 lead.

9:22 p.m. — Hurts is very fortunate to see Smith (and not a Dolphins defender) come down with a pass after he was hit during a throw.

9:19 p.m. — DeVonta Smith with a nice catch on a dart from Hurts to take the Eagles into Miami territory. Aside from the one turnover, the Eagles are putting together long, sustained drives.

9:15 p.m. — Julio Jones is on the board with his first catch as an Eagle. It's a three-yard gain for the future Hall of Famer.

9:12 p.m. — The Eagles have the Dolphins' offense uncomfortable so far. Miami is punting after another Tagovailoa incompletion, and this will be a big moment for the Dolphins' defense.

Eagles 10, Dolphins 3

9:06 p.m. TOUCHDOWN — Happy National Tight Ends Day! Dallas Goedert with a great catch-and-run all the way into the end zone to give the Eagles the lead.

9:05 p.m. — Christian Wilkins gets called for roughing the passer, pushing the Eagles right to the edge of the red zone.

9:03 p.m. — On 4th & 1, you already know what the play is. Hurts gets two yards on a quarterback sneak to keep the Eagles' drive alive.

End of first quarter: Dolphins 3, Eagles 3

8:57 p.m. — DeVonta Smith has the Eagles into Dolphins territory after an eight-yard grab.

8:56 p.m. — Boston Scott with a really nice return to set up the Eagles at their own 39-yard line.

Dolphins 3, Eagles 3

8:52 p.m. FIELD GOAL — The Dolphins can't capitalize on the opportunity, so Jason Sanders ties the game with a field goal.

8:51 p.m. — A Tyreek Hill touchdown is erased by a holding penalty.

8:50 p.m. — The Eagles have lost yardage on three different plays in this quarter, which doesn't seem sustainable. It'll be 3rd & Goal from the 12.

8:48 p.m. — Jaylen Waddle goes airborne to bring down a Tagovailoa pass on third down and set up a 1st & Goal opportunity for Miami.

8:46 p.m. FUMBLE — Jaelan Phillips and Bradley Chubb get in there to knock the ball out of Hurts' hands! The Dolphins have an instant scoring opportunity just outside the red zone.

Bradley Chubb jars it loose and the Dolphins take over with great field position

8:44 p.m. — David Long is all over Hurts, quickly deflecting his second down pass. A key 3rd & 8 here for the Eagles.

8:40 p.m. — The Eagles quickly force a punt after Tagovailoa's pass on 3rd & 15 falls short. So, neither of these explosive offenses start with a touchdown.

8:39 p.m. — Haason Reddick swallows up Raheem Mostert for a five-yard loss to quickly set the Dolphins back.

8:38 p.m. — Tyreek Hill is on the board with a 15-yard catch on a Tagovailoa pass.

8:33 p.m. FIELD GOAL — Elliott connects from 24 yards out, and the Eagles strike first despite their promising drive fizzling out.

8:32 p.m. — Eagles fans are unhappy after Philadelphia opts for three consecutive runs in the red zone. It'll be a field goal try for Jake Elliott.

8:30 p.m. — Jalen Hurts is celebrating National Tight Ends Day by hitting Dallas Goedert on back-to-back passes for a total of 45 yards. The Eagles are into the red zone.

Fitting that the first big play of the game goes to Dallas Goedert on #NationalTightEndsDay

8:28 p.m. — Swift has five touches already. No one else has seen the ball.

8:26 p.m. — The Eagles are riding D'Andre Swift early, as the running back is up to three carries through three snaps. He gets Philadelphia a first down.

8:23 p.m. — The Eagles will start the game with the ball, and we are underway!

8:18 p.m. — As many have pointed out, Tua Tagovailoa and Jalen Hurts were once teammates and competitors at Alabama. Both have something to prove tonight, considering Hurts hasn't looked like himself for much of this season.

8:10 p.m. — The Dolphins can open up a two-game AFC East lead on the Bills with a win tonight. Buffalo was upset by the Patriots earlier today.

7:41 p.m. — Believe it or not, Tyreek Hill has a chance to break 1,000 yards tonight. He would need 186, but with the way he's played this season, that at least seems to be within reach.

7:29 p.m. — Don't forget the Eagles will be back in Kelly Green tonight. This will be a fascinating uniform matchup.

7:20 p.m. — It's 55 degrees and dropping in Philadelphia. That's not unusual for the Eagles, but will Tua Tagovailoa be able to rise to the occasion in cooler weather?

Sunday, Oct. 22 Start time: 8:20 p.m. ET

Sunday night's game between the Dolphins and Eagles is set to kick off at 8:20 p.m. ET from Lincoln Financial Field in Philadelphia, Penn.

The Eagles haven't beaten the Dolphins since 2011, when Miami's loss resulted in the firing of coach Tony Sparano the following day. The Dolphins got the better of Philadelphia in both 2015 and 2019, but none of those matchups carried the anticipation that this one does.","Dolphins vs. Eagles live score, updates, highlights from NFL 'Sunday Night Football' game",https://www.sportingnews.com/us/nfl/news/dolphins-eagles-live-score-highlights-sunday-night-football/5cba865492a875c07c3fdf58,Sporting News
sports,Dan Treacy,2023-11-27T23:32:04+00:00,"The honeymoon period is over for Joshua Dobbs in Minnesota.

The folk hero quarterback threw four interceptions in the Vikings' 12-10 ""Monday Night Football"" loss to the Bears, leading a sluggish offense that didn't find its footing until the fourth quarter in a game that Minnesota wouldn't have needed many points to win.

The Bears' defense swarmed Dobbs throughout the night, sacking him only twice but bringing a great deal of pressure as the defensive backs made plays. Despite the barrage of turnovers, Chicago largely failed to take advantage. The Bears scored only three points off of the four Dobbs interceptions.

MORE: How Joshua Dobbs got his 'Passtronaut' nickname

Meanwhile, Chicago's first turnover of the night — a deflating fumble by Fields when the Bears had a chance to extend their lead to two possessions — was quickly turned into a touchdown by the Vikings. It looked like that score might be the difference, particularly after Fields fumbled away the ball again on the next possession, but the Bears' defense put the ball back in his hands in the final minutes. Fields delivered.

Facing 3rd & 10 outside of field goal range, Fields hit an open D.J. Moore for a 36-yard gain. At that point, all the Bears needed to do was kneel and put Cairo Santos in position to win the game. Santos drilled the 30-yard attempt with 10 seconds remaining, and that would seal it for Chicago.

As he embarks on a crucial stretch that could determine his future with the Bears, Fields flashed the good and the bad. He was excellent on Chicago's opening drive, albeit one that ended without points, but missed throws and costly turnovers allowed the Vikings to hang around. When it mattered most, though, Fields was poised and sealed the Bears' first win over an NFC North opponent since 2021.

While Chicago's hopes are still extraordinarily distant at 4-8, the Vikings saw their playoff chances take a hit on Monday night. Minnesota (6-6) dropped to the No. 7 seed in the NFC with the loss, with the Packers, Rams and Saints all just a half-game behind in the wild-card race. While a win would have put the Vikings in position to compete for the division crown down the stretch, just holding onto a playoff spot will now be a battle for Kevin O'Connell's squad.

Bears vs. Vikings results, highlights from 'Monday Night Football'

(All times Eastern)

Final: Bears 12, Vikings 10

11:07 p.m. — This game is OVER. The Bears don't score a touchdown and barely take advantage of the Vikings' four turnovers, but they walk out of Minnesota a winner as the Vikings fall back to .500.

Bears 12, Vikings 10

11:04 p.m. FIELD GOAL — The Bears are back in front! Santos drills it, and the Vikings have 10 seconds to work a miracle.

11:03 p.m. — The Vikings are using their two timeouts, but there isn't much they'll be able to do once this hits fourth down. Once the Bears kneel it on third down, Santos will be running out for what should be an automatic field goal.

11:01 p.m. — Fields hits Moore for 36 yards! That puts the Bears well into field goal range, and it's exactly what Chicago got Moore to do.

11:00 p.m. — A pair of incompletions set up a crucial 3rd & 10 for the Bears. They're not in field goal range at the Vikings' 49.

10:58 p.m. — Fields picks up a first down with his legs to take the Bears just over midfield. Chicago doesn't have timeouts, but there are still 85 seconds on the clock.

10:55 p.m. — Fields hits Moore for a 16-yard gain on the first play of the drive, gathering some momentum for the Bears ahead of the two-minute warning. Chicago has plenty of time to sneak into field goal range.

10:52 p.m. — Now it's the Vikings' turn to throw behind the line of scrimmage, which means it's the Vikings' turn to lose yardage. Minnesota passes on a long field goal attempt and instead will punt it away with 2:36 remaining and the lead just a point.

10:49 p.m. FUMBLE — Fields loses the ball AGAIN. Josh Metellus knocks it out for the second time, and this time Anthony Barr recovers. This has been an ugly, ugly sequence for the Bears.

10:47 p.m. — Fields throws behind the line of scrimmage to Mooney, and Mooney is predictably dropped for a four-yard loss. That play call has not worked for the Bears in this half.

Vikings 10, Bears 9

10:43 p.m. TOUCHDOWN — The Vikings turn the Fields fumble into the first touchdown of the night! Hockenson goes up and gets Dobbs' pass for the score. The Vikings lead, 10-9.

The first TD of the game is a Dobbs dot to Hockenson!

10:41 p.m. — Dobbs hits Hockenson and pushes the Vikings into the red zone. Minnesota is driving. No one has scored a touchdown yet tonight.

10:40 p.m. — Addison's catch stands, and an Alexander Mattison run has the Vikings at the edge of field goal range. They want more than three points, but it's early enough that they absolutely could settle for a field goal if it got to that point.

10:37 p.m. — Matt Eberflus throws the challenge flag on a nice grab by Addison to give the Vikings a first down. This one looks like it will be tough to overturn...

10:34 p.m. — Wow, Jordan Addison would've had a walk-in touchdown, but Dobbs' throw takes him out of bounds. Addison couldn't have been more wide open.

10:33 p.m. — Brandon Powell has been the Vikings' biggest playmaker at two key points tonight. He goes 18 yards here to put Minnesota near midfield.

10:29 p.m. FUMBLE — That's exactly what CAN'T happen if you're the Bears. Fields loses the football, Sheldon Day recovers, and the Bears waste an opportunity to make this a two-score game.

10:27 p.m. — Fields finds Mooney for a big third down conversion as the Bears get firmly into field goal range.

10:25 p.m. INTERCEPTION — Josh Dobbs throws his FOURTH interception of the night. Justin Jones nearly had it, but it was Kyler Gordon who came away with it. Everything the Vikings have done on the offensive side of the ball tonight looks like a chore.

10:24 p.m. — A third down catch by Jordan Addison extends the drive for Minnesota. Addison only has 25 yards tonight.

10:23 p.m. — Ty Chandler gets the ball on second down and gets nothing. Chandler has not looked very effective tonight with 11 yards on five touches.

Bears 9, Vikings 3

10:18 p.m. FIELD GOAL — After Santos missed from 48 earlier, he drills it from 55. It's 9-3, Cubs Bears.

10:16 p.m. — Byron Murphy comes in to break up a third down pass by Fields, and Santos will come out for a long 55-yard field. He's already missed from 48 tonight.

End of third quarter: Bears 6, Vikings 3

10:14 p.m. — The Bears are starting to look respectable on third down again, this time completing to D.J. Moore to move deeper into Vikings territory. Chicago still might need another first down to give Cairo Santos a fair shot at a field goal.

10:08 p.m. INTERCEPTION — Dobbs throws his third interception of the night! Jaylon Johnson deflected it, Edwards caught it, and interestingly, the Bears have less favorable field position than they would've if it had fallen incomplete.

And Edwards follows it up with the Bears 3rd INT of the game ‼️

10:06 p.m. — After a hold by Jaylon Johnson gifts the Vikings a first down, they still can't capitalize. Ty Chandler can't make T.J. Edwards miss on third down, so Minnesota will go for it on fourth down.

10:02 p.m. — The running game is working, the passing game is not for the Vikings. Mattison has 19 yards three plays into this drive for Minnesota.

Bears 6, Vikings 3

9:58 p.m. FIELD GOAL — A questionable play call on third down as Fields throws behind the line of scrimmage to Moore, who gets nothing. Cairo Santos is able to extend the Bears' lead with a field goal, though.

9:56 p.m. — Fields runs right up the middle for a first down and a bit more as the Bears look to get into field goal range (or better).

9:54 p.m. — Roschon Johnson picks up a first down to keep the Bears' drive alive. He's looked impressive in spurts tonight.

9:50 p.m. — Woah! Kevin O'Connell goes for it on 4th & 7, but Hockenson only gets six yards. The play looked good, the Bears' defense looked better. It's Chicago's ball with favorable field position.

The Bears defense comes up big with a 4th down stop

9:47 p.m. — The Bears answer right back and sack Dobbs, with Sweat and Brisker in there to take him down.

9:46 p.m. — Alexander Mattison has drawn the ire of Vikings fans all season, but he just got Minnesota's second half of to a booming start with a 21-yard run.

End of first half: Bears 3, Vikings 3

9:32 p.m. FIELD GOAL — Greg Joseph drills it from 34 yards out, and this mess of a game is all tied at three entering the half.

9:30 p.m. — The Bears' defense has suddenly morphed back into an elite unit on these last two plays, forcing intentional grounding by Dobbs and pressuring him heavily on the following play. It's 3rd & 24 for the Vikings, who might just settle for a gain of a few yards to set up the field goal.

9:27 p.m. — Another first down by K.J. Osborn drives the Vikings into Bears territory, and the Vikings suddenly find themselves 13 yards from the end zone after Kyler Gordon is called for interfering with T.J. Hockenson. The Vikings have a chance to take the lead with 38 seconds on the clock.

9:25 p.m. — What an effort by Brandon Powell to turn around and make a 28-yard grab while falling to the ground. That's the biggest offensive play of the night for the Vikings.

A perfect catch from Brandon Powell on a perfect pass

9:22 p.m. — Fields had all day to find open receivers on third down and couldn't locate any. Chicago is 0-for-6 on its last six third down opportunities. The Bears are preparing to punt after the two-minute warning.

9:19 p.m. — Fields hits Moore for a 22-yard gain, but his next pass is nearly intercepted by D.J. Wonnum. Neither offense has been able to string together positive plays since that opening drive by Chicago.

9:16 p.m. — Dobbs is nearly intercepted by Jaylon Johnson (again) on third down. The last turnover wasn't Dobbs' fault, but this one should've been a pick. The Bears' defense is all over the Vikings tonight, and Minnesota can't get out of its own way.

9:13 p.m. — Addison, trying to make up for the drop that turned into an interception, looks like he goes for 17 yards, but replay shows his knee was clearly down. It becomes a much smaller 4-yard gain.

9:09 p.m. — Fields comes under pressure on third down and misses D.J. Moore. He's starting to miss these receivers after a hot start. Somehow, the Vikings will have a chance to tie this game or take a lead before halftime.

9:04 p.m. — Dobbs is picked off again! That's two interceptions and just nine passing yards for the Vikings quarterback, but this one doesn't look like his fault - Jordan Addison saw it bounce off his hands. It's Jaquan Brisker with the pick.

9:01 p.m. — Another penalty gifts the Vikings a first down... Both teams are piling on the mistakes.

8:58 p.m. — A roughing-the-passer call goes against the Bears and gives the Vikings some breathing room early in the drive.

8:54 p.m. — Fields overthrows Darnell Mooney on third down, and Mooney gets destroyed in a collision. The Vikings will get the ball back, still somehow only trailing by three. Fields will want that one back.

8:50 p.m. INTERCEPTION — Jaylon Johnson intercepts a throw from Dobbs! That just hung up there. The Bears have been all over Dobbs and the Vikings' offense early on. A taunting penalty after the play hurts Chicago's field position.

Bears 3, Vikings 0

8:44 p.m. FIELD GOAL — The drive fizzles out, and the Bears opt to kick the field goal on 4th & 3. It's good. The Bears are out to an early 3-0 lead, but they've left plenty of points on the board.

End of first quarter: Bears 0, Vikings 0

8:39 p.m. — What a play by Fields to get the ball to a wide open Kmet! The Vikings brought intense pressure, allowing Kmet to get wide open and go for 24 yards. The Bears are in business.

8:38 p.m. — 2nd & 22 becomes 2nd & 27, but the Bears make up 17 yards on two plays. It's 4th & 10, and Chicago is lining up to got for it.

8:36 p.m. — Sacks are killing the Bears in this game. Multiple Vikings defenders wrap up Fields for a 12-yard loss and quickly set Chicago back to 2nd & 22.

8:35 p.m. — The Bears' offense is picking up where it left off. After Fields takes off for 14 yards, he hits Roschon Johnson for 22 yards to take Chicago into Vikings territory.

8:31 p.m. — That's what the Bears got Montez Sweat to do. Sweat sacks Dobbs on third down to force a quick three-and-out and get the ball right back in Fields' hands.

8:27 p.m. — A great start for the Bears ends with zero points as Cairo Santos misses a 48-yard field goal. That's a deflating sequence for Chicago.

8:25 p.m. — The rookie Ivan Pace Jr. finally gets to Fields and drops him for a five-yard loss. It'll be 3rd & long for the Bears.

8:24 p.m. — Fields throws on the run to find Roschon Johnson for a first down, and he quickly follows up with a 13-yard pass to Khalil Herbert. The Bears are driving, and Fields doesn't have an incompletion yet.

8:21 p.m. — The Bears have taken it into Vikings territory with a string of short gains. For Chicago, that's progress.

8:19 p.m. — Fields finds Moore for a short gain and the first 1st down of the night.

8:16 p.m. — The Bears will start with the ball on the road, looking to build early momentum.

8:00 p.m. — Will the Josh Dobbs show continue tonight? He’s had good command of the Vikings’ offense in three games since a trade out of Arizona, flashing an especially strong connection with T.J. Hockenson.

7:45 p.m. — It’s 15 degrees in Minnesota with a feels like of 2, so the roof will come in handy tonight at U.S. Bank Stadium.

7:25 p.m. — Vikings legend Adrian Peterson is in the building to watch his former team.

7:17 p.m. — The Bears enter tonight with the No. 1 and No. 4 picks in the 2024 NFL Draft, and they'll remain in those slots with or without a loss thanks to the strength of schedule tiebreaker.

7:10 p.m. — Heading into Week 13, tonight's game is the difference between the No. 6 and No. 7 seed for the Vikings. The ramifications could be much bigger than that, though. A loss would mean the Packers, Rams and Saints only trail Minnesota by a half-game in the wild card race, while a win would keep the Vikings well within striking distance in the NFC North.

6:55 p.m. — D'Onta Foreman remains out for the Bears, along with CB Tyrique Stevenson.

6:40 p.m. — There's no understating the importance of these final six games for Justin Fields, who is fighting to prove he's the Bears' franchise quarterback. Chicago has a strong chance of landing the No. 1 overall pick in April's draft, thanks to the Panthers' ugly season.

6:20 p.m. — The Vikings are officially without Justin Jefferson tonight, as they'll hold out their star receiver until they return from their bye in Week 14.

sports,Travis Pulver,2023-12-05T20:45:25+00:00,"NFL award longshots can be easy to overlook since each has a favorite(s). The longshot may be playing well, but other players have commanded the spotlight, making it easier for them to go unnoticed.

Whatever the reason, they have not gotten the credit they deserve. However, with five weeks left in the regular season, there is plenty of time for a longshot to become a contender.

But if you wait too long before placing a bet, your payout will be a lot less than if you were to roll the dice on a longshot right now.

Longshots to consider for NFL MVP, OPOY, DPOY, Coach of the Year and Comeback POY

There is always a reason why a player or several players have relatively short odds — they've been the best at their position throughout the season. Consequently, there is just as good a reason why longshots have odds as long as they do.

So, keep your bets small, or use a bonus bet (if you have one available), on longshots. If they do go on to win, smile all the way to the bank while you tell everyone, ""I told you so.""

NFL MVP

Current favorite(s): Brock Purdy , Dak Prescott , Jalen Hurts

, Dak Prescott , Jalen Hurts Longshot(s): C.J. Stroud , Jared Goff

The MVP often ends up being someone, typically the quarterback, from one of the top-seeded teams. Hence, Brock Purdy, Dak Prescott and Jalen Hurts sit atop betting boards after Week 13.

But, by that logic, Jared Goff should be in the conversation. He has played well this season — his Lions are 9-3, poised to win the NFC South and in contention for the No. 1 seed in the conference.

Compared to the 49ers, Cowboys and Eagles, Goff and the Lions may have the easiest schedule to finish the season.

But bettors should also pay attention to C.J. Stroud. He leads the league in passing yards, is one of four quarterbacks eho have started the whole season with a passer rating over 100, and his touchdown to interception ratio is the best in the NFL (4 to 1)

As for the value of his play, Stroud has taken one of the worst teams in the NFL (11 total wins the last three seasons) and turned it into a playoff contender and potential division champion.

Current favorite: Tyreek Hill

Longshot: CeeDee Lamb

There's a good reason why Tyreek Hill is such a heavy favorite to win OPOY. The Dolphins wide receiver is on track to become the first player with 2,000-plus receiving yards in a single season.

But there is a solid chance he does not hit that mark. Of Miami's five remaining opponents, four have pass defenses ranked in the league's top eight. If he slows down, someone like CeeDee Lamb could catch up.

Based on his current season average, Lamb is on track for close to 1,600 yards, but based on his production over the last seven games, he could finish with closer to 1,800 yards.

He will probably need Hill to fade down the stretch to have a shot. But if Hill does and he continues to produce, Lamb could steal OPOY from Hill.

Defensive Player of the Year

Current favorite(s): Micah Parsons , Myles Garrett , and T.J. Watt

, Myles Garrett , and T.J. Watt Longshot: Danielle Hunter

Hunter leads the league in tackles for a loss and is third in sacks with 13.5 (behind Khalil Mack and Watt). Not only has he produced at a high level, but his play has been instrumental in the Vikings turning things around after a 1-4 start.

He may not have the name recognition that Parsons, Garrett and Watt have, but he has played as well, if not better, this season. If he can continue to produce, he at least deserves to be in the conversation, if not win.

Coach of the Year

Current favorite: Dan Campbell +200 (via DraftKings)

Longshot: Sean Payton +2200 (via DraftKings)

Campbell has done a tremendous job with the Lions, but it is fair to wonder if he's the betting favorite because of how well he has done his job this season or over the last two. This year, the team benefited from the groundwork laid last season.

If there were a reward for the best coach over two seasons, he would deserve it. As for this season, not so much.

Sean Payton should be at the forefront of the conversation. It's one thing to turn around a team that was dreadful last season. But he has taken one that got off to a horrible start and turned things around in-season.

Oh — and he has resurrected Russell Wilson's career.

That alone should put him at the top of the list, but he may need to get Denver into the playoffs to convince voters.

Comeback Player of the Year

Current favorite: Demar Hamlin

Longshot: Russell Wilson

Coming back from a life-threatening injury like a cardiac arrest makes Hamlin a great candidate to win CPOY. However, it would be understandable if voters were to look elsewhere since Hamlin has seldom been active on game day and rarely seen the field.

It will depend on how vital voters deem playing to be.

Wilson was supposed to be the next great franchise quarterback for the Broncos when they acquired him prior to last season. But rather than lead the team back to prominence, Wilson was terrible and so was Denver.

This season, Wilson has played well even when the Broncos have not. He is not producing mind-blowing stat lines, but he is keeping his team competitive, playing efficiently and not making many mistakes.

Until his three-interception day last week, he had the best touchdown-to-interception ratio in the league. But even with those picks, his is still second-best.","NFL awards odds: Six longshots bettors should consider for MVP, OPOY, DPOY and more",https://www.sportingnews.com/us/betting/news/nfl-awards-odds-longshots-mvp-opoy-dpoy/ed7dc8b5ba19eb3e71c53349,Sporting News
sports,Heath Cummings,2023-12-19T20:51:32+00:00,"There will be many difficult decisions to be made in Week 16. It is the Fantasy Football semifinals in most leagues and there is a certain finality to every decision. There's no shortage of things to stress over as a Fantasy manager. Whether or not you start Rashee Rice shouldn't be one of them. While Rice is just WR29 on the season, that's mostly due to a slow start, and his hot start has pushed him into must-start, borderline top-12 territory.

The Chiefs' star rookie has four straight games with at least nine targets and he's scored at least 14 PPR Fantasy points in all of those games. Since Week 12, only Deebo Samuel and CeeDee Lamb have scored more PPR Fantasy points that Rice.

On paper, the matchup doesn't look great, because the Raiders have been above average in terms of limiting the Fantasy production of wide receivers. But this hot stretch started against the Raiders, when Rice scored 24.7 PPR Fantasy points against them in Week 12. They are playing a style of defense that limits big plays but allows throws underneath which fits Rice and his 4.3 ADOT perfectly. While the Raiders have surrendered the 11th-fewest passing yards this season, they've given up the fourth-most yards after the catch.

If Rice is on your roster, he's in your starting lineup. You have plenty of other things to stress about.

Last week was the first time since Week 9 that Lamb failed to reach the end zone and the second time since Week 5 that he didn't score at least 17 PPR Fantasy points.

sports,Dave Richard,2023-10-12T21:23:16+00:00,"Fantasy Football is all about the matchups. Even though you drafted your team with certain hopes and intentions, your weekly lineup decisions shouldn't be determined by the order you picked your players in. You need to check who your players play and make sure you've got the right guys in -- and the wrong guys out.

It's too early to be absolutely sure on which matchups will be easy and which ones will be tough, but we can take some educated guesses based on healthy personnel, defensive schemes, track records and key details of offenses. The things we know can help us minimize the impact of the things we don't know. This should lead to better decisions being made.

We'll go through every game and highlight the players who aren't obvious starts and sits (because you don't need to be told to start Justin Jefferson). You should feel more comfortable starting or sitting players based on the information given, and feeling comfortable with your Fantasy lineup before the games start is the best feeling in the world.

It's also important to have a keen eye for matchups dictated by the remaining schedule. I am now updating my projected Strength of Schedule rankings our broken down by position available on SportsLine. My objective is to break down how the schedule affects every Fantasy relevant player for the upcoming four weeks, the playoff stretch and the entire season. You'll also be able to find my key takeaways on which players you should buy low, sell high and more trade advice.

Sit Him (Lineup Decisions) Projections powered by Sportsline Jaleel McLaughlin RB DEN Denver • #38

Age: 23 • Experience: Rookie Weekly Breakdown MATCHUP @ KC KC -10.5 O/U 47 OPP VS RB 6th PROJ PTS 11.8 RB RNK 26th YTD Stats RUYDS 160 REC 7 REYDS 46 TD 3 FPTS/G 9.3 There isn't a Broncos running back you'll have much confidence in starting because they'll all split the proverbial pie too much. I'd start McLaughlin over Williams, but I would rather start Brian Robinson, Alexander Mattison, Rachaad White, Jerome Ford and Rhamondre Stevenson.

LAST WEEK: Despite splitting first-half snaps almost evenly and losing out on second-half snaps considerably, McLaughlin made three splash plays of 21, 22 and 38 yards including a touchdown on a tipped-then-secured designed screen that pierced through the middle of the Jets defense. Those three touches were his best -- his other nine touches each failed to exceed 3 yards. And as mentioned two sentences ago, he played just 10 snaps in the second half when the Broncos were trailing.

FILM: McLaughlin has good vision and speed, both of which were essential in reading the Jets defense at the first and second levels and choosing the correct paths to run on his big plays. His lateral agility was a differentiator on his touchdown catch. McLaughlin's worst asset is his power as he just won't finish runs with physicality like his backfield mates do. But the biggest detriment is that he can't consistently overcome bad blocking, which has been a consistent problem for the Denver O-line all year and certainly something that impacted Javonte Williams in his first handful of games.

WHEN TRAILING: When the Jets were up by eight or more points in the second half, McLauglhin played 4 of 15 snaps and had two carries. That's in line with a trend we've seen from Denver all year: Of the 117 snaps they've played when down by eight or more points, McLaughlin has played 26 snaps (13 touches, seven at Chicago), Williams has played 27 snaps (15 touches, almost all against Miami) and Samaje Perine has played 58 snaps (13 touches) -- more than both backs combined. The only guy who's averaged a strong number on the ground in this specific situation? You guessed it -- McLaughlin (6.1 yards per carry).

CHIEFS: Tend to build leads on their opponents. They also have given up just four rushing plays of 12-plus yards this season, and that includes a fake punt run by the Vikings last week. Kansas City has given up one rushing TD to a running back this season. Impressive numbers considering they're giving up 4.5 yards per carry and rank in the bottom-10 in yards before contact and yards after contact. The secret? Teams don't run the ball that much against them (16.4 attempts per game, fourth-fewest) because ... they tend to build leads on their opponents.

CHIEFS: David Montgomery and Alexander Mattison are the only two running backs to tally at least 10 Fantasy points (PPR or non-PPR) against Kansas City this year. Both scored.

BRONCOS: When McLaughlin, Williams and Perine were all part of the Broncos game plan in their Week 3 blowout loss, Williams had the most work (13 touches) and the most PPR points (8.5). The only time a Denver back had 15-plus touches came in Week 1 when Williams had 17 against the Raiders (and had 9.7 PPR points, a season-high).

But Tennessee's run defense has weakened a bit and the Ravens could be apt to take advantage. Of course there's upside for Flowers to haul in a couple of long targets, and that really is what keeps him in the flex conversation. But I would rather start Christian Kirk, Marquise Brown, Michael Pittman and Jakobi Meyers as WR2 options this week.

Sneaky Sleeper in PPR (Lineup Decisions) Projections powered by Sportsline Justice Hill RB BAL Baltimore • #43

Age: 26 • Experience: 5 yrs. Weekly Breakdown MATCHUP @ TEN BAL -4 O/U 41 OPP VS RB 14th PROJ PTS 7.5 RB RNK 29th YTD Stats RUYDS 115 REC 7 REYDS 25 TD 3 FPTS/G 9.3 It's a little gutsy to go with Hill, who has been inefficient for much of the year. We're counting on the Ravens outsmarting the big size of the Titans defensive line and utilizing Hill for his speed along the edges and in the passing game. His high-value touch share is the icing on the cake and hopefully can lead to him scoring just over 12 PPR points for the second week in a row. I'd take my chances with him over low-upside running backs like Gus Edwards, Antonio Gibson and Jonathan Taylor (for now he's low-upside).

LAST WEEK: I surmised that Flowers would be targeted more if the Ravens run game couldn't get going. Sure enough, it didn't, and Flowers saw a season-high 11 targets at Pittsburgh. Unfortunately, Flowers underwhelmingly caught just five balls for 73 yards with two drops that would have pushed his yardage over 100 had he held on to both targets.

AIR YARDS: Flowers was targeted downfield more last week than in any game this season with a 15.27 Average Depth of Target (ADOT). It was the first time he had a double-digit ADOT and more than six targets. He lined up wide on the majority of snaps (66.7%) and hitches were still his route of choice but there was more diversity there than before. It's also notable Flowers did this while sharing the field with Odell Beckham and Rashod Bateman back on the field.

TITANS: Run defense started the season strong but got smashed last week by Zack Moss and the Colts to the tune of 6.3 yards per carry and four explosive runs (they had allowed two total headed into the game). Moss beat a stacked box on his 56-yard TD scamper. And even when Richardson wasn't on the field the Colts averaged 4.7 yards per run against Tennessee.

TITANS PAST TWO: Against the Bengals and Colts, the Titans allowed at least 2.79 yards before contact per rush in each game and were decimated by zone-scheme runs (at least 6.0 rush yards per carry by RBs).

RAVENS RUN GAME: Have called zone runs half as many times as power runs even though they average a half-yard better per carry on zone runs. They'd be smart to do more of that this week against Tennessee. Hill has the team's best rushing average and highest rush EPA on zone runs.

HILL: In the three games he's played the most snaps in (Weeks 1, 2 and 5), he's played 24 of a possible 43 third-down snaps (56%) and 14 of 20 snaps inside the 10. He's smaller than Gus Edwards, but faster and more versatile, and it's given him extended opportunities for high-value touches.

TITANS PASS DEFENSE: Rank in the bottom-five in catch rate allowed to outside wide receivers (75.8%) but handle them well otherwise (12.5 yards per catch, 3.34 YAC/reception are both top-10). They're equally adept versus hitch routes and WR screens, Flowers' two most-run routes. Tennessee has allowed exactly 50% of pass attempts of 15-plus Air Yards to all wide receivers be completed for a bottom-five yards per catch allowed rate, but they're league average in YAC/reception and touchdowns allowed on those throws, and the numbers are a little bit better for them if you discount four hiccups in Week 1.

Weekly Breakdown MATCHUP @ ATL ATL -2.5 O/U 42.5 OPP VS WR 6th PROJ PTS 12.1 WR RNK 37th YTD Stats REC 25 TAR 31 REYDS 261 TD 1 FPTS/G 11.4 The only two games McLaurin posted good numbers in were Washington's 35-33 win over Denver in Week 2 and Washington's 34-31 OT loss to Philadelphia in Week 4. This matchup has an over/under of 42.5 points, tied for fourth-lowest of the week. Tack on the ascending secondary the Falcons seem to have and the Commanders' diffusion of targets and McLaurin is at best a low-end flex. I'd rather roll the dice on Drake London, Tyler Lockett or Garrett Wilson.

LAST WEEK: Hopeful that his target edge over his teammates would keep growing, and even in a favorable game script where the Commanders were trailing by three scores before halftime, McLaurin only saw five targets against the Bears' heavy zone coverage.

FILM: On the 10 third-down routes McLaurin ran last week, he drew extra coverage on four of them, got open on two of them (Howell threw elsewhere) and was a decoy on Curtis Samuel's touchdown. What happened? Sam Howell was getting rid of the ball quickly and to shorter distances as the Bears were getting some pressure on him. By the end of the game McLaurin's body language seemed dispirited.

COMMANDERS: Throw to their wideouts on 58.7% of their targets, which is below league average (but not as bad as, say, the Falcons at 36.4%). What makes that number worse is that McLaurin has just one more target (31) than Jahan Dotson (30), who has three more targets than Curtis Samuel (27). They're all nearly even after five games and each of them has had a turn leading in targets at least once.

FALCONS: Are expected to play a heavy dose of zone coverage, if only because the Commanders have struggled to be explosive against zone coverage this year. Atlanta also gave a full dose of snaps last week to outside cornerback Jeff Okudah, who wasn't flawless but does offer another sizable body to help against stronger perimeter receivers. Between Okudah and A.J. Terrell there isn't a matchup that's great for McLaurin.

McLAURIN: Has an impressive 91.3% catch rate versus zone coverage this year, but is averaging just 9.3 yards per catch with it on a sub-9.0 ADOT. His target share is below 20% regardless of the kind of coverage he sees.

Start Him (Lineup Decisions) Projections powered by Sportsline Logan Thomas TE WAS Washington • #82

Age: 32 • Experience: 9 yrs. Weekly Breakdown MATCHUP @ ATL ATL -2.5 O/U 42.5 OPP VS TE 31st PROJ PTS 8.4 TE RNK 11th YTD Stats REC 18 TAR 25 REYDS 183 TD 2 FPTS/G 11.6 Streaming Thomas is worth the risk considering how the Falcons have let up numbers to tight ends. The Commanders clearly value the position in their offense, Thomas sees the most throws from Howell, and if Atlanta plays heavy zone coverage then it should mean a bunch of underneath throws for Thomas to take in. You're hoping for at least seven targets here, which is possible. He's worth the nod over Jake Ferguson, Dalton Schultz and Tyler Conklin, and it's close in full PPR over Kyle Pitts.

LAST WEEK: Thomas was a big-time benefactor of the Commanders chasing points against Chicago's heavy zone coverage, seeing 10 of his 11 targets once the Bears built a 17-point lead in the first half. A 24-yard catch on the final play of the first half against prevent defense didn't hurt either.

FALCONS: See the third-most targets per game to tight ends (9.0) which in turn has made them bottom-five in raw stats like total catches and yards allowed. But they float around league average in catch rate allowed (77.8%, below league average) and yards per catch (8.9, better than league average). However, no team has allowed more first-down receptions to tight ends (17). Keep in mind, this defense hasn't seen tight ends better than Evan Engram, Sam LaPorta or Dalton Schultz.

COMMANDERS: Throw to their tight ends on 26.3% of their throws, fourth-most in football. But that hasn't always meant a huge target share for Thomas. In Weeks 1 and 5 he saw at least 22.9% of Sam Howell's targets. He left Week 2 after suffering a concussion and was absent in Week 3; then was not part of the game plan much in Week 4 (7.7% target share against Philadelphia). Perhaps it's all health related and Thomas' volume from last week will stick.

ZONE COVERAGE: Atlanta usually plays a lot of zone coverage early on and if it works they stick with it for the whole game (Week 5 was an example of that). In Weeks 3 and 4 against the Lions and Jaguars they played much more man coverage, especially when they needed a fourth-quarter turnover. And because Howell is much less explosive against zone looks, I expect the Falcons to stick with zone much more this week.

Start Him (Lineup Decisions) Projections powered by Sportsline Kyle Pitts TE ATL Atlanta • #8

Age: 23 • Experience: 3 yrs. Weekly Breakdown MATCHUP vs WAS ATL -2.5 O/U 42.5 OPP VS TE 10th PROJ PTS 10.3 TE RNK 9th YTD Stats REC 18 TAR 32 REYDS 208 TD 0 FPTS/G 7.8 If last week had been Week 1 then I would have been encouraged by Pitts' performance and would probably keep expectations high. But we've seen four really measly weeks from Pitts before Week 5, so forgive me for not rushing back to him as a must-start tight end. The truth is that the matchup is a little tougher for him and for Ridder, plus teams have beaten the Commanders on deep shots to wide receivers, not lumbering tight ends, so I'm not convinced Pitts will maintain his target share or develop more explosive plays. He's still worth trotting out there over Logan Thomas, Dallas Goedert and Cole Kmet, but keep expectations around 70 yards on six catches.

LAST WEEK: Came alive against the Texans' zone-heavy defense with season-highs in targets (11), catches (seven) and yards (87). This was his second game of his last three where his target share was over 23%. It was nice to see him as a key part of the offense, but I can't help but notice he played a season-low 53% of the snaps.

FILM: Two things helped Pitts out: One, he looked a little quicker off the snap and a little faster when running straight. He's still lumbering when he changes directions in his routes but perhaps he's slowly getting healthier. Two, Desmond Ridder seemed very comfortable throwing into tighter windows to Pitts in zone coverage as the two had some good timing down, mainly on dig and out-breaking routes.

PITTS: Continues to harvest a high ADOT -- last week it was 11.36 yards and on the season it's 11.72, the highest among all qualifying tight ends. He also has the lowest catch rate (56.3%) and worst YAC/reception average (1.33 yards) among all qualifying tight ends. Of his 208 yards, just 24 have come after the catch.

COMMANDERS: Play zone coverage at a slightly lower-than-league-average rate, typically turning to man coverage as soon as games get sideways (like in the second quarter last week or the fourth quarter against the Bills). Opponents average 32.0 pass attempts per game against them, ninth-fewest in football, and against tight ends that line up in the slot or out wide like Pitts, the Commanders rank among the top-five in yards per catch, YAC/reception and have yet to allow a reception of 20-plus yards.

DEEP PASSES: The Commanders have allowed the seventh-most receptions of throws that traveled 15-plus Air Yards this season with 19. Of those 19, only two were caught by tight ends (Cole Kmet, Dallas Goedert) and neither went for more than 23 yards.

Hockenson has been a much more relied-upon weapon. They should have more targets than Osborn. And the expected zone coverage Chicago will play further will limit Osborn unless he sees more targets than expected. He has more upside than Jerry Jeudy, Jahan Dotson and Tutu Atwell but I'd rather take a shot on Drake London, Terry McLaurin or Chris Godwin.

LAST WEEK: Over 19 snaps without Justin Jefferson last week, Osborn ran 18 routes and caught both of his two targets for 30 total yards. The receiving average was delightful, but the small-sample target share (12.5%) was saddening. What's funny is that Osborn's target share was much higher when Jefferson was playing (23.3%) but his receiving average tanked (6.3).

FILM: Osborn didn't beat coverage with his speed last week and his burst and agility were just OK. His 22-yard catch came on a Kirk Cousins scramble where he waited in a spot and Cousins hit him, then Osborn ran inside instead of outside where he might have been able to score. He also ducked under an end-zone target instead of leaping for it. It's worth noting that a 36-yard crosser he ran against the Chargers flies in the face of this as he separated from man coverage with speed and technique, then turned upfield and ran outside before racing past a defender and diving for the pylon.

OSBORN: Has a 50% catch rate on the year and that includes whether he faces zone coverage or man coverage. He sees more targets per route run against man coverage and averages more yards per catch and yards after catch against man coverage. Over his career, targets do seem to come more frequently against man coverage and he has been more explosive with them.

BEARS: Play zone coverage at the fourth-highest rate of any defense this season (79.2%). And because Cousins is much more explosive of a passer against man coverage, expect Chicago to keep up their zone defense.

HISTORY: In 20 career games with at least five targets, Osborn has scored at least 12 PPR points in 13 of them. Eleven of those 13 involved him catching a touchdown. Osborn has two career games with over 100 yards -- and one came last January at Chicago.

Start Him (Lineup Decisions) Projections powered by Sportsline Cole Kmet TE CHI Chicago • #85

Age: 24 • Experience: 4 yrs. If you start Kmet, you're buying into his role as Fields' change-up to D.J. Moore -- and in the case of this week, a change-up to the Bears' depleted run game. I especially like his red-zone role and his touchdown opportunities. I'm ready to chance it with Kmet over Kyle Pitts, George Kittle and Dallas Goedert.

LAST WEEK: Kmet kept rolling as Justin Fields' second-favorite target, turning five throws into a 5-42-1 stat line versus a Commanders defense that had shut down the Cardinals, Bills and Eagles tight ends to start the season.

PAST TWO GAMES: Really since the Bears told Chase Claypool to take a hike, Kmet has become a focal point of the offense. He's averaged seven targets per game with a 24.6% target share to go along with four red-zome targets and three end-zone targets. He's second to D.J. Moore in all of those categories except red-zone targets, where he's first -- and by a lot (no one else has more than one, including Moore).

BEARS: May need Kmet as a short-area target to help make up for some of the run game as the Bears are expected to not only be without Khalil Herbert but also rookie Roschon Johnson. In an effort not to overwork their backs, who won't have it easy against the Vikings, Kmet could handle more short-area throws than normal. His ADOT over the past two games has been 7.64, which isn't far from his season average of 6.69.

VIKINGS: Allow the fewest yards per catch to rival tigh ends (5.9 yards), even keeping a lid on Travis Kelce last week (6.7 yards per catch). But they've also seen the fourth-lowest ADOT from tight ends (5.0 yards per target), almost as if teams know they won't be able to succeed on downfield shots against them (zero completions of 20-plus yards from tight ends). These numbers are tough but if Kmet gets the target volume we've seen him have over the past couple of weeks he can still put up palatable numbers. And, tight ends have scored three times in the Vikings past three games.

It may also come to pass that the Seahawks are trailing in the game and thus have to throw. Consider Lockett more of a top-30 receiver who you should sit for Zay Flowers and Gabe Davis but start over Chris Godwin, Nico Collins, Garrett Wilson and Drake London.

BENGALS: Consistently tailor their defensive coverage to the weaknesses of the offenses they face. So when a quarterback struggles against zone coverage, they'll play more zone. This worked in their favor in all but one game this year (Ravens, Week 2). Cincinnati also has turned on the juice for their pass rush, getting a pressure rate of over 40% in each of their past three games, all versus teams with suspect offensive lines.

BENGALS: Are expected to be without top cornerback Chidobe Awuzie, and they also are rotating one of their safety spots between Nick Scott and Jordan Battle. D.J. Turner is expected to replace Awuzie.

GENO SMITH: Has a 47.8% completion rate and a lowly 4.1 yards per attempt average against man coverage so far this season. He's also barely thrown deep (4.3% of his attempts went 20-plus Air Yards). A huge reason for the low numbers is because his pass protection has been dreadful. The anticipated return of left tackle Charles Cross should help him have more time, which in turn helps his receivers.

OUTSIDE WRs: Have caught just 50% of their targets against the Bengals this season, third-lowest in football. However, when those receivers have caught the ball they've averaged 17.9 yards per catch, which is the third-most in the league. The Bengals defense has really only let up big games to receivers who catch touchdowns.

LOCKETT: Already the team leader in target share for the season, Lockett sees more targets on a route-run basis against man coverage (28%) compared to zone (21%). He also does better with them, averaging a full 2.0 more yards per catch and with a much higher explosive play rate (14.3% compared to 5.0% against zone).

Remember, Wilson's injury was to his abdomen, not his legs, so there might not be much of a limit on how much work he'll do (though it's unlikely he'll have a ton of touches). I'd take my chances with him over Samaje Perine, Jerick McKinnon and Antonio Gibson.

WILSON: Started practicing this week after being sidelined with finger and abdomen injuries since late August. He and his fresh legs are back just in time as rookie sensation De'Von Achane hit Injured Reserve this week with a knee injury.

DOLPHINS: Aren't quite the bastion of rushing that some headlines have made them out to be, but they're just over league average in rush rate at 43.7% and above league average in RB runs per game at 22.6. All of these numbers are weighted heavily by their 50-point win over Denver in Week 3 when they ran the ball 42 times with their running backs. Their 7.6 yard per carry average is due to Achane's breakout start more than anything else.

McDANIEL: Prefers to use two running backs from game to game, and in Miami's past three games there's been a relatively close split in carries between two backs (18 and 13 in Week 3, 8 and 7 in Week 4, 11 and 10 in Week 5).

LAST YEAR: Wilson was efficient in his eight games in Miami, averaging 4.7 yards per carry with three touchdowns and just over 60 total yards per matchup. That includes two games he barely played in (under 20 snaps) -- take those out and he averaged 78.2 total yards per game.

SALVON AHMED? Was a healthy scratch last week and figures to be no better than a special-teams player this week. In fact, in the seven games Raheem Mostert, Wilson and Ahmed were all active for with the Dolphins last year, Ahmed played 18 offensive snaps and 25 special-teams snaps. Wilson played 213 offensive snaps and 10 special-teams snaps.

PANTHERS: Rank in the bottom five against running backs in rush yards per carry allowed (5.2), rushing touchdowns allowed (right), explosive run rate allowed (9.8%), yards before contact per rush allowed (2.26). Every running back with at least 10 carries against the Panthers this season has posted at least nine non-PPR points. There's been one every game, but multiple running backs have had 10-plus non-PPR points in two games through five weeks.

It's purely a hunch but because Taylor is still ramping up and it takes as many as four weeks to ""get right,"" Moss should lead the way and could see as many as 15 touches. I'd start Moss as an RB2 over Rhamondre Stevenson, Emari Demercado and Taylor.

I'd view Taylor as at best a bye-week replacement with an eye on his Week 9 matchup at Carolina as his breakout game.

LAST WEEK: The Colts eased Jonathan Taylor back into action after sitting out the first four games and barely practicing at all. He played just 16% of the snaps to Zack Moss' 80%, and Moss handled nearly every third down, fourth down and snap inside the 10-yard line. Of note, Taylor played just three second-half snaps.

FILM: Taylor looked as big and strong as I remember, and he wasn't shy about contact at all. I liked how he fought for yardage on pretty much every carry. He did seem rusty when it came to processing his blocking and figuring out where to run -- it felt more like he ran up the backs of his linemen more than scan for space to make cuts and elude defenders. It was a good first step.

FILM: Moss, meanwhile, had consistently great vision and used his combination of speed and power to crash through the Titans' front, especially when they stacked the box against him on his 56-yard touchdown run. There's nothing to suggest Moss is struggling, which means his playing time doesn't figure to dwindle.

THIS WEEK: Colts coach Shane Steichen said he's ramping up Taylor's workload in practice, and the official team website believes Taylor's snap share will increase both this week and as the season goes on. But Moss still figures to be the lead back and handle a majority of high-value touches.

JAGUARS: Last week's showing against a Bills run defense that was disinterested in running the ball helped push their run defense numbers to new heights. On the season they've given up one touchdown on the ground, 3.6 yards per carry, a 6.0% explosive run rate and 2.27 yards after contact per rush to running backs. Only the explosive run rate doesn't register among the top-six across the league.

It also helps the cause that the Jaguars aren't exactly terrible against the run (3.6 yards per carry allowed), meaning that the Colts can't easily dominate on the ground for four quarters. He's best as a low-end WR2 in PPR leagues but no better than a flex in half- and non-PPR. For example, I'd start Zay Flowers, Tyler Lockett and Amari Cooper over Pittman in non-PPR, but not in PPR.

WEEK 1: Came alive in the second half against the Jaguars and finished with a season-high 97 yards on eight catches with a well-documented 39-yard catch-and-run for a touchdown.

SINCE WEEK 1: Has been above 14 PPR points once (Week 3 at Baltimore, a game Gardner Minshew started). Over the past two weeks Pittman has totaled just 12 targets against the Rams and Titans for six catches and 67 yards. It's a far cry from Week 1.

MINSHEW: Clearly more of a developed downfield thrower than Anthony Richardson and has thrown at Pittman on 26.4% of his routes run including four red-zone targets and an end-zone target. Even last week when Minshew played less than a half Pittman saw a target once every five routes he ran with Minshew.

JAGUARS: Rank fifth with a 77.7% zone coverage rate, and they've consistently played a lot of zone in every game. They were also busted up by outside receivers (over 17.0 yards per catch) last week against Buffalo and two weeks ago against the Texans. Pittman tends to play outside more than in the slot. Finally, an outside receiver has scored at least once against the Jags in every game this season, including Pittman back in Week 1.

PITTMAN: Tends to do better against zone coverage than man, though he was much better last year than this year. This year he's actually been about even in catch rate and yards per catch against man and zone coverage but does have a higher explosive play rate against zone (9.7% compared to 6.7% against man). That tracks back to last year, by the way -- his explosive play rate was nearly twice as high against zone than man.

Flex Starter In PPR (Lineup Decisions) Projections powered by Sportsline Nico Collins WR HOU Houston • #12

Unfortunately, neither of his matchups are particularly favorable. I could see Collins getting a lot of short targets and for that reason alone I'd be OK starting him as a flex option in PPR ahead of Tyler Lockett and Chris Godwin, but behind Jakobi Meyers, Jaylen Waddle and Gabe Davis.

LAST WEEK: Even in a game where the Texans lost Tank Dell to a concussion before the half, Collins couldn't get much going. That included in the second half when he saw one target and couldn't catch it. He definitely wasn't shadowed by anyone and was almost never double-teamed, though there were a couple of routes where a safety was in proximity. It could have had more to do with the Texans attacking the middle of the field against the Falcons' zone coverage.

SAINTS: Have played the fifth-fewest snaps of zone coverage this season and have ignored tendencies some quarterbacks have had through the early portion of the season. It's just what they like to do. Stud cornerback Marshon Lattimore has not followed receivers much this season, playing 87% of his snaps at right cornerback (to the left of the quarterback). Their other primary outside corner, Paulson Adebo, has allowed a 50% catch rate on the season with minimal YAC.

COLLINS: It's minor but Collins does see a higher target per route run rate against man coverage (25%) than zone (22.2%). He also has a higher catch rate (87.5%) and higher receiving average (23.3) against man than zone (65.4% and 17.8). However, he's run nearly four times as many routes against zone coverage compared to man.

MATCHUPS: It's also worth pointing out that Collins' two really big games came in Week 2 (vs. Indianapolis) and Week 4 (vs. Pittsburgh), both teams that rank in the bottom-10 in Fantasy points allowed to wide receivers. The Saints are in the top half.

STROUD: Has been outstanding against man coverage all year, completing a higher rate of passes (67.6%) for 3.5 more yards per attempt (11.1) than versus zone (7.6). However, he is nowhere near as impressive when he's pressured, completing 48.1% of his throws for a weak 4.3 yards per attempt.

The Cowboys wound up paying the price through the air for playing a ton of zone coverage instead. It was suggested by a friend that they didn't want to get burned by long runs by Christian McCaffrey. I guess that worked. The combination of the 49ers defense running hot and the Browns offense figuring to get stuffed should make for at least a game script for Purdy to have decent numbers. I'm not making the mistake again of benching Purdy -- I'd start him over Trevor Lawrence, Geno Smith and Jared Goff.

LAST WEEK: Took on one of the toughest pass rushes in football and slayed them for four touchdowns on just 24 pass attempts. Of his seven incompletions, one was dropped, two were batted at the line of scrimmage, another was a throwaway and two more were defensed. Purdy was off-target on 0.0% of his throws.

FANTASY: Has hit at least 20 Fantasy points in 9 of his 10 regular-season starts, and it really should be 10 for 10 because of a touchdown that was ruled a lateral back in Week 2. If you include the two playoff games he completed, Purdy has delivered at least 20 in 10 of 12 games. And in six of those 10 he hit at least 23 Fantasy points including each of his past three games.

BROWNS: Have played the least amount of zone coverage snaps of any team in football this season, and they've done it consistently. There isn't a game this season where they've played even 65% of zone coverage snaps, and there have been only three quarters when they've called more than 70% of their snaps in zone coverage. Plus the Browns just saw the Cowboys play 90% of their snaps in zone coverage and Purdy cooked them like BBQ chicken.

PURDY: Has been sensational against both man and zone coverages this season. His completion rate and yards per attempt are noticeably higher against zone, but five of his seven passing touchdowns have come versus man coverage. However, Purdy's been at his worst when pressured (like most quarterbacks), completing 50% of his throws for 6.7 yards per attempt with a gaudy 15.9% off-target rate. These stats are actually better than they were last week.

BROWNS: Rank third in pass rush pressure rate at 41.5% and blitz at an above-average 29.3% rate. Granted, the Cowboys ranked higher than that last week and got beat anyway.

LAMAR JACKSON: Faced the Browns in their last game, saw a ton of man coverage and was pressured a bunch and he still threw two touchdowns and completed 79% of his throws for 9.8 yards per attempt. And he did it without his starting left tackle and two of his top receivers. His defense turning over an ill-prepared Browns offense helped a bunch.

In PPR you can hope for another game with five catches, which honestly isn't a stretch since he just had one against a good defense two games ago. Maybe he's good enough to start as an end-of-the-barrel RB2, but I'd feel better going with Rachaad White, Alexander Mattison or D'Onta Foreman.

SINCE CHUBB GOT HURT: Ford has averaged 4.3 yards per rush and 7.7 yards per catch with three total touchdowns (including the catch he had on the play after the Chubb injury). His 69-yard cross-field run at Pittsburgh has certainly helped his numbers out; without it he has zero touches of 20-plus yards and his only run for more than 10 yards came with a holding penalty.

SNAPS: Ford has yet to dominate snaps at running back for the Browns, playing right around 60% in Weeks 3 and 4. In fact, Ford does not have more than 14 touches in a single game since taking over for Chubb, but it's been just two games.

HERE COME THE 49ERS: On the year they've held enemy running backs to 3.7 yards per carry with an explosive run rate of 1.7% (which somehow is only second-best in football). The only rush defense metrics they're not top-five in are Defensive Rush EPA (just below league average), yards before contact per rush (0.88 yards, they're sixth), yards after contact per rush (2.80, just above league average). They even lead the NFL in fewest missed tackles. Tony Pollard had an 8-29-0 rushing stat line against them last week.

WHAT ABOUT THROUGH THE AIR? Even though the 49ers see the fifth-most RB targets per game, they're better than league average in catch rate allowed (75%) and top-10 in both yards per catch (5.7) and YAC/reception (6.10) allowed to running backs. Pollard caught 4 of 5 passes for 35 yards last week.

P.J. WALKER: Has thrown 17.2% of his career pass attempts to running backs. For 2023, the NFL league average of QB throws to running backs is 18.2%, so he's just below the current league average.

Sit Him (Lineup Decisions) Projections powered by Sportsline Amari Cooper WR CLE Cleveland • #2

Age: 29 • Experience: 9 yrs. If you start Cooper, you should not only have lower expectations but basically pray to the Fantasy Gods for some garbage production or ludicrous target volume. It's hard to trust Cooper to come through for a reliable stat line, and there's a lot of downside for a single-digit-point week. He's at best a low-end No. 3 receiver; I'd rather start Tyler Lockett, Chris Godwin or Drake London.

LAST GAME: With rookie Dorian Thompson-Robinson at quarterback, Cooper saw six targets and caught one for 16 yards. Half of the six targets were uncatchable. In his previous three with Deshaun Watson he had at least seven targets in each, and at least 16 PPR points in the past two.

SINCE THEN: Watson hasn't practiced with the team. P.J. Walker was named the starter despite being on the team's practice squad and took reps this week in preparation for their game against the Niners.

WALKER: Was cut by the Bears after the preseason before linking up with Cleveland. Has five career passing touchdowns in 15 games (seven starts). He's had multiple passing scores in one NFL game. Only twice has a receiver had 100 yards from Walker (both by D.J. Moore, once in 2020, once in 2022). Two other times has a WR had at least 70 yards (Curtis Samuel in 2020, Terrace Marshall in 2022). In his NFL career, Walker has thrown specifically to wide receivers on 71.2% of his throws, which basically the only good thing you can take away from this paragraph.

COOPER: In effectively 30 career games without Dak Prescott, Derek Carr or Deshaun Watson on the field (meaning he played with a backup), Cooper has 13 touchdowns (seven from Brissett) and seven with 100-plus yards (four with Brissett). More importantly, Cooper had at least 15 PPR points in 13 of the 30 games (six with Brissett), so 43% of the time.

BRISSETT VS WALKER: Comparing their play over the past four seasons, Brissett had a considerably higher completion rate (63% to 57.5%) with a lower interception rate (1.7% to 4.8%) and lower off-target rate (10.3% to 18.9%). Brissett didn't throw downfield as much as Walker, contributing to a higher ADOT for Walker, but not by much (8.8 to 8.3). Both quarterbacks were right around 6.5 yards per pass attempt.

49ERS: Oh yeah, the matchup isn't great. No team allows fewer yards per catch to wideouts than the Niners (9.7), and they're thrown at a ton by offenses that have to play from behind. Only three receivers -- Puka Nacua (20 targets), Marquise Brown (10 targets) and Michael Wilson (two touchdowns) have had more than 15 PPR points against them. And only one other receiver -- Tutu Atwell (nine target) -- had more than 12 PPR points.

Some might say dumping Elliott and giving more work to Stevenson would make sense, but Elliott actually has a higher rushing average and better before/after contact rates than Stevenson does! Maybe the Patriots will turn to another running back in hopes of finding anything that can help take pressure off of their depleted passing game. I can't recommend Stevenson as a start until we see proof of him playing well -- a favorable road matchup alone isn't enough. I'd rather start Jerome Ford, Zack Moss and D'Onta Foreman.

LAST WEEK: Was the first time Stevenson did not have 16 or more touches in a game. He had eight carries and no receptions. He also played a season-low 50% of the snaps but did handle 10 of 16 snaps on third/fourth downs. Stevenson started and played the first two series, then Elliott started off the next two series, but they rotated in and out for each other the whole game. Elliott continued to be the Patriots RB of choice in the two-minute offense to end the first half.

STEVENSON: Nothing has changed in terms of his efficiency. We can blame the offensive line to some degree but Stevenson has averaged 0.97 yards before contact per rush this season. That ranks 30th out of 41 qualifying running backs. And if you think that's bad then consider his yards after contact per rush average of 1.79, which is dead last among those same 41 qualifiers.

EXPLOSIVE RUNS: Stevenson has one (1) explosive carry of 12 or more yards. It was against Miami. It went 12 yards. This is a big change from 2022 when he had 21 explosive runs and an explosive run rate of 10%, which was eighth-best.

RECEIVING: Is averaging 3.6 targets per game and catching 67% of them but is getting just 7.3 yards per catch and has one (1) explosive catch of 16 or more yards. That one went for 32 yards against the Eagles in Week 1. Since then his longest reception has been for seven yards.

PATRIOTS: Have run one (1) play inside the opponents' five-yard line this entire season. That should help explain the lack of touchdowns for Stevenson.

RAIDERS: Rank in the bottom 10 versus RBs in yards per carry allowed (4.3) and yards after contact per rush allowed (3.04). But they're also in the top-10 in most rush attempts by RBs faced (24.4 per game) and they've given up just three rushing touchdowns and an explosive run on 4.9% of their snaps (that's actually 10th best). And would you believe only one running back has scored more than 15 PPR points against the Raiders this season? It's James Cook.

Think of Demercado as a candidate for 10 PPR points and perhaps four non-PPR points. I'd rather start both Colts RBs, Javonte Williams and Chuba Hubbard if Miles Sanders is out.

LAST WEEK: After James Conner left with an injury, Demercado played 100% of the Cardinals snaps. They could have used veteran RB Corey Clement to help him out but kept him on special-teams duty. And Demercado actually played fairly well, flashing solid speed and physicality on his runs with some patience blended in. He's not as big as Conner but he played kind of like him.

THIS WEEK: Arizona released a depth chart with second-year back Keaontay Ingram as the first stringer. It is expected that Ingram will work with Demercado in the Cardinals backfield this week.

INGRAM: Through 15 regular-season games over two years, Ingram has averaged 1.9 rush yards per carry. His career-long run is 13 yards. This past preseason Ingram did rock for 4.4 yards per run but no carry went more than 11 yards. His 2022 preseason wasn't better than his 2023 preseason.

THIRD DOWNS: Demercado has worked as the Cardinals third-down guy since Week 2, playing 74% of those snaps. He's also had some reps in their two-minute offense. It's not a stretch to say he's been Arizona's passing downs RB. That should remain as part of his role moving forward. But honestly, unless Ingram gets a hot hand early, Demercado should be given a chance to work running downs too.

RAMS: Have taken a step forward as a decent run defense. In their past three games, they're holding running backs to 3.6 yards per carry and are better than league average in yards before and after contact as well as in missed tackles. A rival running back has 13-plus PPR points in three of their past four games, but each of those backs had at least 20 touches. No one looks like even a 12-touch back for the Cardinals.

Age: 29 • Experience: 8 yrs.

But the Buccaneers defense deserves some credit for holding up against their opponents. Plus, Goff's two big games came against bad secondaries and suspect pass rushes. This one is a little tougher. I think Goff is good enough to start ahead of Trevor Lawrence, Sam Howell and Geno Smith, but I would put Matthew Stafford and Brock Purdy ahead of him.

LAST WEEK: Even without two of his most explosive targets, Goff exploited the Panthers defense for 236 yards and four total touchdowns on 28 pass attempts. And in the one specific area where you might have thought David Montgomery would have gotten the ball -- inside the 5 -- Goff threw two of his scores and dove for another.

BUCCANEERS: Have been zone-heavy in three games but went man-to-man in an attempt to get back into their game against the Eagles in Week 3 and couldn't help their cause. That's their only loss on the season. The Bucs also blitz at the third-highest rate in football (41%) but even so they don't get a ton of pass rush pressure on the quarterback.

GOFF: Has proven to be a little bit better against man coverage than zone this season, but his stats against both coverages are just fine (his QB rating against both are over 105 each). He has a better TD rate and attacks downfield a little more when he sees zone coverage. As for when he's blitzed, Goff's completion rate is sensational either way (over 68%) but naturally he has better numbers when he is not blitzed. The difference is noticeable but not detrimental.

ROAD WOES: I have to bring it up even though I don't like bringing it up -- since arriving in Detroit, Goff has topped 20 Fantasy points (six points per passing touchdown) twice in 16 road games.

BUCCANEERS: Only one quarterback, Jalen Hurts, has posted over 20 Fantasy points this season on the Bucs. And only one quarterback, Kirk Cousins (on 44 attempts) threw two touchdowns against them.

Flex Starter (Lineup Decisions) Projections powered by Sportsline Garrett Wilson WR NYJ N.Y. Jets • #17

Age: 23 • Experience: 2 yrs. Weekly Breakdown MATCHUP vs PHI PHI -7 O/U 41 OPP VS WR 31st PROJ PTS 11.7 WR RNK 29th YTD Stats REC 24 TAR 43 REYDS 279 TD 2 FPTS/G 12.8 Wilson's situation continues to hold him back from the potential he so clearly has. If he couldn't put up a monster game against the Broncos, it's a tough sell that he'll do so against the Eagles. I do think volume will be in his favor, so counting on him for close to 16 PPR points (half that in non-PPR) is fair. That gives him flex appeal over Nico Collins and Tyler Lockett, but not over Jakobi Meyers, Zay Flowers or Gabe Davis.

LAST WEEK: Coming off the heels of what felt like a step in the right direction, Wilson couldn't take advantage of a favorable matchup against the Broncos. He led the Jets in targets (seven) but was second behind Tyler Conklin in catches and yards. Wilson's 26.9% target share was a season low. Getting shadowed by Patrick Surtain on all but one of his targets didn't help, nor did having a pass bounce off his hands within five yards of the end zone.

ZACH WILSON: Was off-target on 15.4% of his throws for the second consecutive week even though he had a higher completion rate (73.1%) and passing yard average (7.7 yards per attempt). It's a byproduct of Wilson attempting just 26 throws after putting the ball up 39 times the game before.

UNCATCHABLE: Of the 43 targets Garrett Wilson has seen from Zach Wilson, 14 of them (33%) have been uncatchable.

EAGLES: Have let up a slew of receiving numbers by virtue of seeing so many passes thrown against them (27.4 targets per game just to wide receivers). So naturally they rank in the bottom five in catches allowed, YAC allowed and touchdowns allowed. But on per-target metrics they're doing all right. A 60.6% completion rate allowed is 10th-best, 11.4 yards per catch allowed is seventh-best and 4.06 YAC/reception is on par with the league average.

PASS RUSH: As overworked as the Eagles secondary has been, their pass rush has been solid. Against soft O-lines in Washington and L.A., the Eagles have put pressure on at a rate of 37.6% and have blitzed 33.3% of snaps. Given the state of the Jets offensive line after losing guard Alijah Vera-Tucker to a season-ending injury, it wouldn't be a surprise if the Eagles were to spook Zach Wilson frequently, leading to shorter throws, off-target throws and sacks.

LET'S DO MATH: If the Jets are forced to throw much more than they did last week, say it's 39 times, then roughly 30% of those targets will go to Garrett Wilson. That's 12 targets. That's great. But of those 12, one-third figure to be uncatchable, meaning that we're looking at eight receptions at best for Wilson. And even though Wilson is averaging 8.7 yards per catch on the season, he deserves the benefit of at least 10.0 yards per catch since the Eagles are allowing 11.4 yards per catch to receivers. So maybe he can deliver just past 15 PPR points. Not too shabby.

Age: 31 • Experience: 7 yrs. Weekly Breakdown MATCHUP @ BUF BUF -14 O/U 44.5 OPP VS TE 4th PROJ PTS 10.2 TE RNK 7th YTD Stats REC 23 TAR 34 REYDS 239 TD 0 FPTS/G 9.4 Waller is a safe bet to lead the Giants in targets, but everyone in the stadium will know it. That includes the Bills, who could easily drape a second defender near him to force the Giants quarterback (whoever it is) to throw elsewhere. Waller is a low-end starter in the same range as Kyle Pitts and Cole Kmet -- and only ahead of them because of the volume we're hoping he gets.

LAST WEEK: Waller was a focal point of the Giants offense and caught 8 of 11 targets for 86 yards at Miami. Four of the targets came from Tyrod Taylor (for 3-31-0), all in the fourth quarter. That was a 33% target share just from Taylor. And Waller could have had a bigger game as he was close to corralling some deep targets from Daniel Jones.

TAYLOR: Has a career target rate of 22.4% to his tight ends, which is real nice. As recently as 2020 he leaned on Hunter Henry while with the Chargers, and even in two of his hey-day years with the Bills did he work tightly with Charles Clay. He shouldn't be a detriment.

THIS SEASON: Waller has the highest target share on the G-Men, but it's 20.8%. His ADOT also sits at 8.9, and both that number and the target share got lifted up by the Giants' decision to force-feed targets to Waller last week. He also ran more downfield routes than we're used to seeing. If the Giants stick with this then Waller can meet some of his lofty expectations. But I think if Brian Daboll had it his way he'd try to find explosive plays from all of his receivers and spread the ball around.

BILLS: Got their first test against tight ends last week in Evan Engram and swarmed him -- he caught 4 of 8 targets for 28 yards. He is used similarly to Waller, which makes Buffalo's game plan for slowing Waller down easy to carry over this week. Their pass rush should also impact the Giants passing game and may force Waller to run shorter routes so he gets open quicker.

Weekly Breakdown MATCHUP @ LAC DAL -2.5 O/U 51 OPP VS QB 21st PROJ PTS 18.9 QB RNK 15th YTD Stats PAYDS 1061 RUYDS 45 TD 5 INT 4 FPTS/G 13.8 Trusting Prescott is a tall task, even in what looks like a favorable matchup. The Cowboys might pivot to a slower approach with Tony Pollard handling the run game more than he has been over the past couple of games. That could take pressure off of Prescott, but it doesn't mean he'll unload statistically. I'd rather start Sam Howell, Jared Goff and Matthew Stafford.

LAST WEEK: A nightmare scenario as Prescott tried to get aggressive on downfield throws early and missed until he hit KaVontae Turpin for a 26-yard touchdown. Then Prescott HAD to throw deep to try and climb back into the game and got sloppy on two of his interceptions (a third bounced off of Michael Gallup's hands). He didn't even play the last 12 minutes of the game and the Cowboys got blown out.

THIS SEASON: Prescott's completion rate is fine (69.4%) and his off-target rate is low (8.1%). So what's the problem? Prescott's ADOT is 6.5, ranking 28th among 33 qualifying quarterbacks. He's actually second-to-last in pass attempts of 10-plus Air Yards; only Daniel Jones has thrown fewer. And the scary part is that his ADOT was over a yard lower (5.4) going into last week's game, so the Cowboys tried to let him air it out and the plan completely backfired.

O-LINE: It's possible that injuries that go as far back as to Week 2 along with some declining play from Tyler Biadasz and Terence Steele could be contributing factors for Prescott's low ADOT. He doesn't want to get hit, so he's getting the ball out as fast as he can. Even against the 49ers he sped up his motion and overshot those targets. He's just not as comfortable and the offense isn't adjusting well enough.

CHARGERS: Traditionally play a good amount of zone coverage but have changed it up more often this season and used more man-to-man, including versus Miami in Week 1. But despite some headliners in the front seven and 16 sacks in their past three games, the Chargers rank fourth-worst in pass rush pressure rate at 29.5% this season. They also blitz at about the league average rate. In theory this should not be a difficult matchup for Prescott, but

KELLEN MOORE: Prescott's QB coach and/or playcaller for the prior five seasons will be coaching the Chargers offense on Sunday, but he's sure to have spilled the beans on Prescott's tendencies. We've seen offensive coordinators come back to wreck their old teams all the time and could see it again on Sunday.

The fiery NFC championship game rematch also featured 49ers’ touchdowns on six straight possessions and a pair of ejections that showed this year’s title game may not run again through Philly, after all.

49ers' Dre Greenlaw has been disqualified from tonight's game after this incident on the Eagles sideline. pic.twitter.com/2N4W17N8u9 — FOX Sports: NFL (@NFLonFOX) December 3, 2023

The 49ers (9-3) left Philly 10 months ago battered in the NFC championship game behind injuries to Purdy and his backup, and they never stood a chance in a 31-7 loss. The 49ers spent an offseason chirping at the Birds – Samuel called one Eagles cornerback “trash” – and then entered the Linc as a rare betting favorite against a 10-win team at home.

The Eagles (10-2) suffered a scare when Hurts jogged off the field in the fourth and went straight to the locker room. He was cleared to play and returned to action with about 10 minutes left. It was not immediately clear when Hurts was injured.

By the time last season’s NFL MVP runner-up returned, the Eagles trailed 35-13 and were on their way toward their first home loss of the season. Hurts did hit DeVonta Smith for a two-yard TD on his return drive. He finished 26-of-45 passing for 298 yards. Purdy put the finishing touches on the win with a 46-yard TD to Samuel.

Perhaps all that braggadocio paid off for the 49ers. Hard feelings spilled into the game, highlighted by a scrap in the third quarter that got 49ers linebacker Dre Greenlaw and the the Eagles’ chief security officer tossed.

Dom DiSandro, a constant presence on the Eagles’ sideline, pulled Greenlaw off Smith after a reception. Greenlaw popped up and reached over two officials to touch DiSandro’s face with a closed fist. Greenlaw was ejected. DiSandro, a cult hero in Philly for his ever-present backup when Eagles are out in public, also was told to leave and walked to the locker room to a roaring ovation.

Los Angeles Chargers 6-0 New England Patriots

Justin Herbert threw for 212 yards and set up a pair of Cameron Dicker field goals that were all the Los Angeles Chargers (5-7) needed for their first shutout in six years. Keenan Allen came back from a thigh injury to catch five passes for 58 yards. But the only scoring the Chargers could manage was a pair of 38-yard field goals in the second quarter. New England made a quarterback switch, benching Mac Jones in favor of Bailey Zappe. But the Patriots (2-10) still lost their fifth straight game. For the first time in franchise history, the Patriots have been shut out at home twice in a season. Zappe was sacked five times – two by Khalil Mack, giving him a career-high 15 for the season and 99 in his career. Zappe was 13 for 25 for 141 yards; he did avoid an interception for the first time in three games, the previous two in relief of Jones.

Tyreek Hill had two touchdowns among his 157 yards receiving to help the Miami Dolphins rout the Washington Commanders 45-15. The AFC East-leading Dolphins are 9-3 for the first time since 2001. Tua Tagovailoa was turnover-free after giving the ball away four times over the past two games. De’Von Achane ran for two touchdowns in his return after missing five of the past six with a knee injury. The Commanders have lost four in a row. Washington’s Sam Howell threw a pick-6 for a third consecutive game.

Detroit Lions 33–28 New Orleans Saints

Sam LaPorta had career highs of nine catches for 140 yards, including an early touchdown and a crucial first-down snag in the final minutes, and the Detroit Lions beat the reeling New Orleans Saints. Detroit improved to 9-3, their best record through 12 games since they went 10-2 in 1962. The Saints lost quarterback Derek Carr in the fourth quarter to back, shoulder and head injuries. Carr was hurt on a penalized hit by Bruce Irvin. New Orleans fell to 5-7, behind first-place Atlanta in the NFC South.

Kansas City Chiefs 19-27 Green Bay Packers

The Green Bay Packers picked up their fourth win in five games as they beat the defending Super Bowl champions. The 6-6 Packers are now in the NFC wildcard places after Sunday night’s win.

Denver Broncos 17-22 Houston Texans

Nico Collins had a career-high 191 yards receiving and a fourth-quarter touchdown, and Jimmie Ward intercepted Denver’s Russell Wilson in the end zone with nine seconds left to left to help the Houston (7-5) Texans hold on for a win over the Broncos. Ward leapt in front of intended receiver Lucas Krull to secure the fourth victory in five games for Houston and snap a five-game winning streak for Denver (6-6). Wilson was intercepted a season-high three times, all of them after halftime. Derek Stingley Jr had the first two picks for the Texans. Rookie CJ Stroud threw for 274 yards for Houston.

Indianapolis Colts 31-28 Tennessee Titans

Gardner Minshew threw a four-yard touchdown pass to Michael Pittman with 2:31 left in overtime and the Indianapolis Colts (7-5) beat the Tennessee Titans (4-8) for their fourth straight victory. The Colts had to score a touchdown after Nick Folk made a 46-yard field goal with 4:19 left in overtime to put Tennessee up. Tennessee lost their first true home game this season and have yet to win consecutive games. The Titans blew a 17-7 lead. Nick Folk missed his first extra point this season with 5:26 left in regulation, which would have put Tennessee up 26-25.

Desmond Ridder threw a 20-yard touchdown pass to MyCole Pruitt and the Atlanta Falcons took over sole possession of first place in the NFC South by slogging their way to an ugly victory over the punchless New York Jets.

The Falcons (6-6) have back-to-back wins for the first time since opening the season with victories over Carolina and Green Bay. Atlanta entered tied atop the division with New Orleans, who lost to Detroit.

But this game appealed only to fans of sloppy play, punting and penalty flags. The Jets (4-8) got an early safety but couldn’t get anything going – again – on offense in losing their fifth straight game. New York even pulled quarterback Tim Boyle and replaced him with Trevor Siemian in the fourth quarter to try to provide a spark, but it was more of the same misery in what appeared a half-filled MetLife Stadium.

Cleveland Browns 19–36 Los Angeles Rams

Matthew Stafford threw three touchdown passes, Puka Nacua became the first Rams rookie wide receiver to reach 1,000 yards in a season, and Los Angeles extended their winning streak to three games. The Rams have won three straight for the first time since winning the Super Bowl after the 2021 season. At 6-6, they are back in the playoff race after dropping three straight before their bye week. Joe Flacco was 23 of 44 for 254 yards with two touchdowns and an interception in his Browns debut. Cleveland fell to 7-5 and occupy the final playoff spot in the AFC.

Arizona Cardinals 24–10 Pittsburgh Steelers

James Conner ran for 105 yards and a pair of touchdowns against his old team as the Arizona Cardinals beat the Pittsburgh Steelers. It was the Cardinals’ first win at Pittsburgh since 1969. Arizona took control late in the first half with a 99-yard touchdown drive that ended with a five-yard strike from Kyler Murray to Trey McBride. The Cardinals led the rest of the way, enduring a pair of lengthy delays due to severe weather. The Steelers lost starting quarterback Kenny Pickett to an ankle injury late in the first half and scored their only touchdown in garbage time.

Tampa Bay’s Mike Evans scored on a 75-yard reception and joined Jerry Rice as the only players in NFL history to string together 10 consecutive seasons with 1,000-plus yards receiving. Evans finished with seven receptions for 162 yards, increasing his season totals to 61 catches for 1,012 yards and 10 touchdowns. Rice has the league record of 11 straight seasons with more than 1,000 yards receiving. The Bucs won for only the second time in the past eight games.

Wullaert equalised for Belgium in first-half injury time before she took advantage of Georgia Stanway’s handball to fire in a 85th minute winning penalty.

Laura De Neve earlier had curled the hosts ahead in the ninth minute before a serious collision between Alex Greenwood and Jassina Blom halted play in the 18th minute. whilst quick-fire goals from Lucy Bronze and Fran Kirby after the restart saw England fight back to lead briefly.

Belgium now sit second in the group ahead of England by one point but two points behind group leaders, Netherlands.

Having battled to a narrow home win last Friday (27 October), England began on the front foot in Leuven with a fourth minute free-kick cleared by Belgium’s Nicky Evrard.

Belgium however drew first blood in this Halloween encounter after Chloe Kelly was penalised for handball just outside of the box, which allowd De Neve to curl her ninth-minute free-kick straight into the near-top right corner beyond the reach of an outstretched Mary Earps.

England struggled to mount a response as Belgium continued to soak up their pressure and hit them on the counter attack, until Greenwood and Blom banged heads in the 18th minute as they tried to meet an aerial pass.

The impact of their clash of heads resulted in both players falling to ground which necessitated a 13-minute delay for medical treatment, with Blom eventually able to continue after concussion checks whilst Greenwood was stretchered off.

England tweeted at half-time that Greenwood was concious and talking to medical staff under observation.

Alex Greenwood is conscious and talking, and is being monitored by our medical staff. ❤️ — Lionesses (@Lionesses) October 31, 2023

That lengthy delay reignited England’s intensity which paid off as Lucy Bronze drew a 36th minute foul from Marie Detruyer, from which she headed in from Kelly’s subsequent free-kick two minutes later to restore parity.

Kelly then fired wide in 41st minute as Belgium were forced to substiute De Neves due to injury, which unsettled their defence.

That change further motivated England whilst Belgium’s defence were adjusting to the enforced change, as Bronze’s header a minute later from Keira Walsh’s cross was fired wide on the rebound by Alessia Russo.

England continued to press and got their reward in the 44th minute as Lauren Hemp was unleashed up the left flank by Walsh, which allowed her to find Kirby on the pullback to rifle in beyond Evrard to turn the tie around.

England’s lead however only lasted seven minutes into 14 minutes of first-half injury time, as Wullaert was played through on the counter-attack by Janice Cayman to slot into the far left corner to pull Belgium level at the break.

Upon the second-half start, Kirby quickly drew a foul from Kassandra Missipo but Russo fumbled control from Kelly’s free-kick and her shot was blocked as England attempted to reclaim the lead.

Evrard then saved Kirby’s shot from Bronze’s pullback pass in the 52nd minute as England continued to test the Red Flames’ defence.

England however were given an almighty scare just past the hour mark as Wullaert pounced upon a through ball and side-stepped both Jess Carter and Millie Bright, yet Earps crucially blocked her shot with a stunning save to keep the score level.

Belgium however were forced to defend for much of the last half-hour as Russo and Georgia Stanway saw shots denied, whilst substitute – Rachel Daly nodded wide in the 80th minute from Walsh’s deep corner towards the left post.

Sarina Wiegman’s Lionesses were eventually made to pay for their wasted chances as Stanway handballed Daniels’ 83rd minute spot, which led referee – Esther Staubli to award a penalty to the hosts.

Wullaert stepped up and fired the penalty into the bottom-left corner to put Belgium in front, despite Earps diving the correct way to try and make the save.

Belgium eventually clung on for victory which put them second in the group ahead of England and two points behind Netherlands, with their two rivals set to meet on 1 December in a blockbuster showdown.

What’s Next?

Belgium will meet Scotland on Friday 1 December at Den Dreef, Leuven in a 8:30pm CET (7:30pm) kick-off, with the Belgian Red Flames knowing that a win would put their fate in their own hands heading into their final group match away to the Netherlands.

England meanwhile host Netherlands that same evening at Wembley Stadium, London, in a 7:45pm GMT kick-off, with the Lionesses needing to win their last two games and hope that Netherlands plus Belgium slip up to stand any chance of qualifying for the knockout stages

sports,Andy Hunter at Anfield,2023-10-26T21:00:42+00:00,"Jürgen Klopp’s prediction that Liverpool would not “fly” through the Europa League group stage amounts to their only mis-step so far. Qualification for the knockout phase is already close at hand with the procession continuing against Toulouse.

Klopp could ring the changes before Nottingham Forest’s Premier League visit on Sunday, give a full debut to 19-year-old left-back Luke Chambers, first Liverpool outings to Calum Scanlon and James McConnell, and still enjoy a fluent, dominant display. It was polished by goals from Diogo Jota, Wataru Endo, Darwin Núñez, the highly impressive Ryan Gravenberch and Mohamed Salah. Salah’s strike with the final kick of the game was his 43rd European goal for Liverpool and took him above Thierry Henry as the most prolific goalscorer for an English club in European competition.

“I think I said it before – it is really easy to fall in love with this team, there is so much excitement,” said the Liverpool manager after a seventh win in seven home matches this season. “We have to make massive steps, we have to grow, but a lot of signs are really positive and how the team interacts with each other is really nice.”

Rivalry was forgotten and friendship remembered as Liverpool paid a warm tribute before kick-off to Bill Kenwright, the Everton chairman who died on Monday. The Hollies’ He Ain’t Heavy, He’s My Brother – the song Kenwright chose for a Hillsborough tribute at Goodison Park and became a fund-raising single for the justice campaign – was played to mass applause from the Liverpool fans inside Anfield. Kenwright’s powerful speech at the Hillsborough memorial service in 2013 and lasting support for the bereaved families will not be forgotten across Stanley Park.

Liverpool have won all three group games with something to spare, underlining why they are favourites for this season’s competition, but the visit of French Cup winners Toulouse proved the most entertaining contest so far. Granted, Toulouse’s terrible defending was a contributory factor but so too was the marauding midfield play of Gravenberch and Liverpool’s quality in front of goal.

The hosts swept into an early lead when Jota collected a Joe Gomez interception, spun away from Cristian Cásseres and Niklas Schmidt, breezed past a nonexistent challenge from Logan Costa and beat goalkeeper Guillaume Restes with a confident finish.

The travelling Toulouse contingent were in uproar as their side stunned Anfield with a fine equaliser. Aron Dønnum dissected the Liverpool defence with a first time ball to Thijs Dallinga, who kept his cool on the long run towards Caoimhín Kelleher’s goal and drilled his shot beyond the stand-in keeper.

More pedestrian defending allowed Liverpool to regain the lead via the first goal of Endo’s Anfield career. Harvey Elliott played a short corner to Curtis Jones, he found Trent Alexander-Arnold, and the Japan international guided the captain’s cross beyond the Toulouse keeper with a precise header. The towering Moussa Diarra epitomised Toulouse’s defending around the goal by standing back to admire Endo as he headed home.

Leon Bailey and Youri Tielemans – his first for Villa – put them in control in AZ Stadium after less than 25 minutes. Vangelis Pavlidis wasted the hosts' best chances but Watkins and John McGinn added more goals after the break in the Netherlands before Ibrahim Sadiq grabbed a consolation. It was the second time in two games Villa had scored four after their 4-1 Premier League win over West Ham on Sunday. Ki Klaksvik became the first Faroe Islands club to win in the group stages of a European competition with a stunning 3-0 success againt Olimpija Ljubljana. Rene Joensen, Pall Klettskard and Jakup Andreasen were the heroes at at the 6,500 capacity Torsvollur national stadium. Aberdeen's hopes of navigating a route through the Conference League group stage suffered a major blow as they threw away a two-goal lead to lose 3-2 against PAOK Salonika on a rollercoaster night at Pittodrie. Having weathered heavy pressure in a goalless first half, Barry Robson's men found themselves two goals to the good by the hour mark thanks to Bojan Miovski and Dante Polvara. But a stunning comeback saw the Greek side take three points after goals from substitutes Kiril Despodov and captain Vieirinha, and a stoppage-time penalty, awarded after a VAR check, from Stefan Schwab. Was this helpful? Thank you for your feedback.

It was soon three when Gravenberch surged through the Toulouse midfield and found Jones. The midfielder’s shot was blocked by Mikkel Desler but rebounded off Jones into the path of Núñez, who lashed a thumping finish into the roof of Restes’ net.

The second half was memorable mainly for misses. Gabriel Suazo squandered a glorious chance to haul Toulouse back into the contest when Kelleher sliced a clearance into the path of Dallinga. The goalscorer squared for Suazo who had a free shot on a goal with only Alexander-Arnold standing in it. To his despair, he managed to find the defender’s thigh.

Not to be outdone, Núñez failed to complete what should have been a stunning individual goal when he left Rasmus Nicolaisen floundering with a superb footwork and rounded the Toulouse goalkeeper. The Uruguay international struck a post instead of the open goal and was on his knees in disbelief when Gravenberch finished the job from the rebound. Salah came off the bench to end the rout and create yet more history when scoring off the underside of the bar.",Salah seals emphatic Europa League win for Liverpool against Toulouse,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/oct/26/liverpool-toulouse-europa-league-match-report,The Guardian
sports,The New York Times,2023-12-03T23:04:37+00:00,"This sport’s identity crisis has existed since the inception of the College Football Playoff a decade ago, but never before have we had to come to terms with it the way we did on Sunday.

That identity crisis? Whether the teams that play for the national championship should be the best or the most deserving. In the nine years before this season, the best and most deserving seamlessly became one, resulting in cut-and-dried decisions on which teams would make the field.

Advertisement

In the final season of the four-team era — before it expands to 12 in 2024 — the CFP committee was charged with a very difficult decision that was guaranteed to result in a worthy team feeling cheated. The committee, for the first time, was actually going to have to choose what it values more — the teams that earned it or the teams that look the best on TV.

Florida State, the most deserving, became the first unbeaten Power 5 conference champion left out of the field. The Seminoles were the ones left feeling cheated.

And with that one decision, the committee didn’t just choose teams in a given year. It revealed to the world the ugly truth about college football — this sport is a beauty contest where decisions on which teams can win the national title are sometimes made as much in a cozy hotel boardroom in Grapevine, Texas, as they are on the actual field.

The Playoff field is as follows: 1. Michigan, 2. Washington, 3. Texas, 4. Alabama.

Michigan and Washington made it through the season unscathed. Texas lost a nail-biter in its rivalry game to Oklahoma, and the Longhorns, wait for it, beat Alabama.

We wouldn’t be having this discussion if Florida State’s star quarterback, Jordan Travis, didn’t break his leg two weeks ago. But the Seminoles team that just beat Louisville 16-6 in the ACC Championship Game was relying on a third-string quarterback. The win was far from impressive.

devastated. heartbroken. In so much disbelief rn, I wish my leg broke earlier in the season so y’all could see this team is much more than the quarterback. I thought results matter. 13-0 and this roster matches up across any team in those top 4 rankings. I am so sorry. Go Noles! — Jordan Travis (@jordantrav13) December 3, 2023

The committee, knowing it was going to unjustly break someone’s heart, decided to break Florida State’s. In that room on Saturday night, the committee members decided the Seminoles weren’t good enough for us.

Advertisement

That’s not what sports are supposed to be about. And with the four-team CFP era ending after this season, fans will be viewing it as a broken system that needed to be changed rather than the first frontier of the modernization of the sport.

It’s very easy to fathom why the committee couldn’t choose between Alabama and Texas. Alabama is a one-loss SEC champion that beat Georgia on Saturday, ending the Bulldogs’ 29-game winning streak. Texas, a one-loss Big 12 champion, beat Alabama by 10 points in Tuscaloosa in September.

Many fans were hoping that the SEC would be left out entirely for the first time, but the committee — charged with picking the “best teams” — couldn’t ignore what the ultra-talented Crimson Tide accomplished. But if Alabama goes, how could the committee leave the team out that beat it?

It couldn’t.

This is probably the path of least resistance. Outside of Florida State fans, the general population will move on convinced that the Playoff semifinals will be more entertaining with more high-level teams. The best teams, as they say, won out.

The problem with choosing the best is that it’s entirely subjective and ultimately misleading given this is a sport that routinely features unpredictable results and unforeseen runs. The last time a team was relying on a third-string quarterback heading into the College Football Playoff — Ohio State in the inaugural season of the four-team field — won the national title.

The difference between those Buckeyes and this Florida State team was that Ohio State won the Big Ten title game that year 59-0. Florida State was in a close game with Louisville that was, quite frankly, not an enjoyable watch for people who love the excitement of big-time offense. Perception, wrongly, became reality.

“Florida State is a different team,” CFP committee chair Boo Corrigan said after the field was revealed. “You look at who they are as a team without Jordan Travis — they are a different team.”

Advertisement

That’s a well-informed opinion that’s probably true. It, however, is not a fact. You could make the case that Florida State is so good that it won a Power 5 conference championship game with a true freshman quarterback. In the CFP, Florida State would have gotten second-string quarterback Tate Rodemaker back with a month to prepare for a semifinal game.

Florida State was robbed.

And its head coach didn’t hide his disappointment.

“I am disgusted and infuriated with the committee’s decision today to have what was earned on the field taken away because a small group of people decided they knew better than the results of the games,” Mike Norvell said in a statement. “What is the point of playing games?”

As difficult as it would have been, the right thing for the committee to do would have been to leave Alabama out. Most of us know in our gut that the Crimson Tide — the most talented team, on paper, in the sport — are one of the four best teams. Alabama is certainly equipped to win the whole thing.

But Alabama — like peers Georgia and Ohio State, teams with a wealth of raw talent on their rosters — lost a game (at home). Better teams have been left out in the past than this Alabama team because losses had consequences.

Alabama’s loss to Texas didn’t have a consequence because we’re enamored with the SEC and what it means to beat Georgia. It didn’t matter that Alabama — though perceived to be an entirely different team in September — lost to the Longhorns. That game could have been a Playoff game in September. It turns out it was an exhibition.

There are plenty of people who are against the expansion of the field to 12 because of the sanctity of the regular season. But if the games in the regular season aren’t going to matter when it comes to picking the final four, then there are no consequences for expanding to 12.

The regular season didn’t decide who made it this year. Thirteen people did.

The games mattered. The results didn’t.

sports,Kyle Bonn,2023-11-17T21:48:03+00:00,"Canada took a major step towards Copa America 2024 qualification as Stephen Eustaquio's 85th-minute strike gave them victory in their CONCACAF Nations League quarterfinal first leg and a first win in Jamaica for 35 years.

Porto midfielder Eustaquio slotted in from Richie Laryea's surging run and low delivery, restoring the lead Canada had initially established through Jonathan David during first-half added time.

Shamar Nicholson fired in Jamaica's equaliser 13 minutes after the break but their opponents will seal their place at Copa America if they avoid defeat in the second leg at Ontario's BMO Field on Tuesday.

Jamaica vs Canada result

Score Goal scorers Jamaica 1 Shamar Nicholson (58) Canada 2 Jonathan David (45 +2), Stephen Eustaquio (85)

Starting lineups:

Jamaica (4-4-2, right to left): Blake (GK) — Leigh, Pinnock, Bernard, Lembikisa — Decordova-Reid, Latibeaudiere, Johnson, Bailey — Antonio, Nicholson

Canada (4-4-2, right to left): Borjan (GK) — Laryea, Vitoria, Miller, Adekugbe — Buchanan, Kone, Eustaquio, Davies — Larin, David

In a game rearranged for Saturday after heavy rain flooded parts of Kingston's Independence Park on Friday, David capitalised on a skilful turn and cross from Cyle Larin to score his 26th international goal as part of a dominant first half in which his side had four of the five attempts on target.

The Reggae Boyz went closest before David broke the deadlock, Aston Villa attacker Leon Bailey hitting the post with a shot from Bobby Decordova-Reid's corner.

Nicholson was aghast when his finish was initially ruled out for offside, only for a VAR intervention and pitchside monitor check by referee Mary Penso to justify Jamaica's celebrations in their technical area.

The Spartak Moscow forward had raced on to Daniel Johnson's quickly taken freekick and converted coolly to give Jamaica hope of extending their unbeaten run to six matches.

As well as a Copa America berth, the winners in three days' time will advance to the semifinals of the Nations League, where their opponents will be one of fellow quarterfinalists the USA, Trinidad and Tobago, Honduras, Mexico, Costa Rica and Panama.

How can Canada qualify for the Copa America 2024?

The Rouges' task is now ostensibly straightforward: avoid defeat against Jamaica and they will be competing alongside the likes of reigning champions Argentina at the Copa America in the US when it starts in June.

Jamaica have never won in Canada, although they showed enough here — in sunshine, mercifully, following the postponement of the game in torrential conditions the previous night — to suggest they could spring an upset.

Their task will be made harder by the probable absence of Michail Antonio, while Bailey could not match speed and timing with accurate finishes when presented with good early chances.

West Ham United forward Antonio immediately signalled for treatment before limping down the tunnel with a possible hamstring injury during the first half.

Reaction from Steven Vitoria:



""It feels great to get our first win here in 35 years. It wasn't easy, far from it. Still a lot to be done but we're one step closer to where we want to go.""#CANMNT pic.twitter.com/3YYwSNCgFm — Canada Soccer (@CanadaSoccerEN) November 18, 2023

Lille striker David had two promising early opportunities, poking a shot into Milan Borjan's arms under pressure from two markers and applying a looping header to an Alphonso Davies cross, forcing the goalkeeper to backpedal and claim.

Even if they are knocked out on Wednesday, there will be another chance for the losers of the tie to reach the Copa America.

The ousted Nations League quarterfinalists will compete for two more qualification spots, and the calibre of teams in those playoffs is likely to be weaker, with the USA looking almost certain not to need that route following their 3-0 first-leg win over Trinidad and Tobago.

Eustaquio's first international goal since 2021 also ended Canada's run of two consecutive defeats and gave them a second win in seven matches.

Reaction from Milan Borjan:



""It feels amazing. What the boys did today, in this heat and on this pitch, is unbelievable. We need to come out again and show the brotherhood in Toronto. We need a full stadium there to give us that support."" #CANMNT pic.twitter.com/lwuD0qLvp2 — Canada Soccer (@CanadaSoccerEN) November 18, 2023

Jamaica vs Canada updates from rescheduled CONCACAF Nations League match

Fulltime: Jamaica 1-2 Canada

Canada will reach Copa America 2024 if they preserve their unbeaten record at home to Jamaica on Wednesday!

The hosts are a little unfortunate, having scored an equaliser and held out until five minutes from time, but they now face a huge task to reach the semifinals.

90 mins: Jamaica 1-2 Canada

Good news for Jamaica: there will be six minutes of added time.

87 mins: Jamaica 1-2 Canada

It's been 35 years since Canada have won in Jamaica. Now would be a great time to end that run and put them within touching distance of Copa America.

85 mins: GOAL – Jamaica 1-2 Canada (Stephen Eustaquio)

Is that a huge goal for Canada?

Richie Laryea charges clear on the right, approaches the penalty area and cuts a perceptive low pass back into the path of the onrushing, unmarked Stephen Eustaquio, who slots in!

Watch:

82 mins: Jamaica 1-1 Canada

There's some choreographed dancing going on in the stands involving fans in green shirts carrying yellow pompoms. Cheering scenes.

The official attendance is a little more than 3,500.

79 mins: Jamaica 1-1 Canada

Alphonso Davies shows some invention for Canada on the left, but the ball ends up in Andre Blake's arms.

76 mins: Jamaica 1-1 Canada

Leon Bailey is booked for an altercation with his marker. It's been a while since we've had a clear chance in this game – settle for a draw all-round?

73 mins: Jamaica 1-1 Canada

It's drinks break time. Canada emerged the stronger following the first-half drinks break...

70 mins: Jamaica 1-1 Canada

Canada have never lost at home to Jamaica, so you suspect they'll be satisfied with this result. Their opponents have shown enough to suggest they could spring a surprise in the return game, though.

67 mins: Jamaica 1-1 Canada

A Canada substitution we could have mentioned...

SUBSTITUTION 🔁

64 mins: Jamaica 1-1 Canada

Jamaica have a freekick beyond the halfway line. As usual, they send a string of players towards the penalty area. Milan Borjan catches the cross.

61 mins: Jamaica 1-1 Canada

Stephen Eustáquio's freekick doesn't create a great deal of danger. Canada have only won one of their last 11 visits to Jamaica, and that record won't improve unless they can do better than that from opportunities.

60 mins: Jamaica 1-1 Canada

Canada have a freekick just outside the edge of the Jamaica penalty area on the left. This is promising. Andre Blake stands at his near post and directs some of his team-mates.

57 mins: Jamaica 1-1 Canada

Referee Mary Penso checked the pitchside monitor and agreed with Shamar Nicholson's protestations that the goal should have counted.

That goal came about because of a quick piece of thinking from Daniel Johnson, directing a freekick on to Shamar Nicholson's run while Canada appeared to have switched off.

56 mins: GOAL – Jamaica 1-1 Canada (Shamar Nicholson)

Jamaica have the ball in the net after Shamar Nicholson bursts onto a pass inside the penalty area and produces a cool, low finish!

The visiting bench celebrate but their exuberance is cooled by an offside flag going up. There will be a VAR check...

54 mins: Jamaica 0-1 Canada

Here's how Jamaica started.

51 mins: Jamaica 0-1 Canada

Canada go close! Jonathan David nears the centre of the penalty area in a central position and lashes a dipping shot towards goal which Andre Blake does well to tip behind.

48 mins: Jamaica 0-1 Canada

There's a scene that looks better suited to WWE as Richie Laryea and Shamar Nicholson both dive to the floor following a full-throttle tussle for the ball on the flank.

Referee Mary Penso rushes in to calm the situation down. Jamaica's Nicholson needs to keep his cool, having been booked during the first half.

46 mins: Jamaica 0-1 Canada

Jamaica restart the action!

Halftime: Jamaica 0-1 Canada

It wasn't all plain sailing for Canada - especially when Leon Bailey struck a post with a shot - but they are good value for their lead after having 11 of the 16 attempts at goal during that half and four of the five on target.

This would be an excellent result for their prospects of qualifying for Copa America 2024, with the home leg to come for them.

45 mins +2: GOAL – Jamaica 0-1 Canada (Jonathan David)

Canada take the lead! Cyle Larin responds to a bouncing ball inside the box by turning smartly to befuddle his two markers, then scythes a low delivery across the face of goal.

Jonathan David gratefully gobbles up the opportunity, tapping in at the far post!

Watch:

Jonathan David lights up the scoreboard for Canada! 🇨🇦 pic.twitter.com/bCVlAEQpge — Concacaf Nations League (@CNationsLeague) November 18, 2023

45 mins: Jamaica 0-0 Canada

End-to-end fare. Ethan Pinnock stops Jonathan David from getting a shot away inside the penalty area, and Andre Blake then punches Alphonso Davies' cross clear from a crowded box.

At the other end, Sam Adekugbe shows strength and speed to stop Trivante Stewart from racing clear onto a long ball.

44 mins: Jamaica 0-0 Canada

Bobby De Cordova-Reid almost set up an opener for Leon Bailey five minutes ago. This time he takes aim himself from a long way out, zipping a shot into Milan Borjan's arms.

41 mins: Jamaica 0-0 Canada

Milan Borjan is down for an extended period of treatment. The Canada goalkeeper was clutching his left calf.

Shamar Nicholson, who appeared to be the possible culprit, exchanges a hug with Borjan after he rises to his feet but is still booked for his trouble.

39 mins: Jamaica 0-0 Canada

Leon Bailey hits the crossbar! Bobby De Cordova-Reid sends a corner towards the far post, where Bailey beats his man with his run and sends his low first-time strike against the near post and away.

Jamaica could not have come any closer!

36 mins: Jamaica 0-0 Canada

Canada have had the better of the action since the drinks break. Alphonso Davies fails to beat the first defender with a corner from the right, but Canada find him in a good position on the same flank again, from where he whips a cross towards Jonathan David at the far post.

The forward loops a header back in the opposite direction, and the backtracking Andre Blake stretches to claim with reasonable ease.

33 mins: Jamaica 0-0 Canada

Alphonso Davies has a chance to send in a freekick from a useful position not far from the Jamaica penalty area in the right channel.

His low delivery bobbles through almost everyone before the hosts clear.

30 mins: Jamaica 0-0 Canada

The action resumes with a goalkick to Canada. The game has been played at a ponderous pace at times – you sense these teams need to up the ante if a breakthrough is to come before the interval, although perhaps both are happy to remain cagey during the early stages of the tie.

27 mins: Jamaica 0-0 Canada

Drinks break time. Jamaica coach Heimir Hallgrimsson is wearing a fetching back-to-front white baseball cap as he offers instructions to Trivante Stewart, among others.

A man in a marvellous yellow wig and black-and-yellow tracksuit can be seen in the stands, which are somewhat sparsely populated.

24 mins: Jamaica 0-0 Canada

Substitute Trivante Stewart turns and tries his luck from distance for Jamaica, to no avail.

These sides are yet to find their range yet.

21 mins: Jamaica 0-0 Canada

Ismael Kone sends a fierce shot from outside the penalty area wide for Canada.

Trivante Stewart has replaced Jamaica's Michail Antonio, who limped off a few minutes ago.

18 mins: Jamaica 0-0 Canada

Bad news for West Ham United fans: Michail Antonio is down for an extended period of time and asks to be substituted.

He eventually rises to his feet and hobbles down the tunnel, accompanied by medical staff. Speculatively, that could be a hamstring issue.

15 mins: Jamaica 0-0 Canada

Leon Bailey should have scored for Jamaica again! An aerial ball down the flank bounces kindly for the Aston Villa attacker inside the penalty area on the left, deceiving Steven Vitoria.

Bailey drags his first-time shot wide of the far post. Heimir Hallgrimsson applauds as Bailey's runs continue to cause Canada problems.

13 mins: Jamaica 0-0 Canada

Leon Bailey can only nod the freekick on. Milan Borjan scoops the ball up in Canada's goal.

12 mins: Jamaica 0-0 Canada

Jamaica win a freekick beyond the halfway line on the right and load the box. Well, it's not quite the penalty area, but there's a long line of players awaiting the delivery just outside of it.

9 mins: Jamaica 0-0 Canada

Best chance so far for Canada! Jonathan David breaks free inside the Jamaica penalty area on the right, sending Greg Leigh off balance and coming under pressure from Daniel Johnson as he closes in on goal.

The striker can only poke a low shot gently towards goalkeeper Andre Blake, who gathers.

7 mins: Jamaica 0-0 Canada

There isn't a great deal of action to report in the sunshine. Here's how Canada looked before kickoff.

4 mins: Jamaica 0-0 Canada

Jamaica should have scored! Leon Bailey is through on goal from a long ball but produces a tame, rushed finish that drops comfortably wide of Milan Borjan's goal with the goalkeeper well off his line.

Manager Heimir Hallgrimsson turns and shows his frustration on the sideline, while Bailey - justifiably - looks sheepish. That was well short of the quality he's capable of.

2 mins: Jamaica 0-0 Canada

Leon Bailey canters along the left flank and sends in a dangerous low cross which Canada do well to clear. Bailey is adjudged to have been offside.

1 min: Jamaica 0-0 Canada

Glorious-looking conditions in Kingston this morning, thankfully, with sunshine and a picturesque, tree-filled backdrop to this stadium.

It's a quiet start between these sides, Jamaica in their familiar yellow and green home strip, Canada in dark blue.

UPDATE (8:35 p.m. ET): Canada Soccer has made the postponement official, as the match will kick at 10:30 a.m. ET (7:30 a.m. PT) tomorrow morning .

Nothing else was announced as far as what should happen if the pitch remains water logged. That means one of two things: either the federations haven't sorted that out yet, or they are looking to keep that in-house as not to risk publicly announce plans for something that never ends up happening.

Here's to hoping that won't be necessary anyways, and tomorrow morning's kickoff can proceed as planned!

UPDATE (8:25 p.m. ET): **GAME POSTPONED UNTIL TOMORROW**

The match has been called off for the evening, and they will try again tomorrow. Journalists have announced that the match has been pushed back until 10:30 a.m. ET / 7:30 a.m. PT. No official word from the federation yet, but this seems as concrete as ever.

They tried to wait it out tonight, but it just wasn't to be.

When Canada Soccer make the decision official, we will pass that information along as well as any contingency plan made public as well for if the pitch remains unplayable at the new time.

50 mins to potential kickoff: No word on tonight's match inside an hour until the possible kick time is not good news, as further delay could mean the federation's officials are hashing out alternate plans.

It sounds like a decision will be made soon on whether tonight's match can go ahead. If it is necessary to push the game back, they would likely try to play tomorrow, but if the pitch is still unplayable at that point, then further action would need to be taken.

It's possible for them to cancel the first leg and simply play the second leg in Canada, but the teams would have to agree to that. It would put Jamaica at a serious disadvantage in a matchup with significant ramifications — Copa America qualification — on the line.

1 hour to potential kickoff: There is still no update on whether this game will take place tonight, or if so, what time. At least the players are keeping themselves loose as they wait for the weather to lighten up!

This was the update we expected, as Canada Soccer have announced that the match will not kick off before at least 9 p.m. ET. However, it does appear more and more likely that a game will indeed take place tonight. Will it clear up enough to create a playable surface, or has there been too much rain to proceed safely?

It's at the point where you wonder if this match will even take place, and there seems to be some initial chatter of it possibly being called off. Postponing international matches is extremely difficult, but player safety has to be considered.

Still, that's a tense and difficult prospect, and both sides will with to avoid that precarious situation, as missing out on the Copa America would be a monumental disappointment for both Canada and Mexico.

2 hours to kickoff: While the Canadian federation is reeling from the departure of John Herdman, one player is happy to see change happen at the top. Central midfielder Mark-Anthony Kaye had been left out of multiple squads towards the end of Herdman's tenure, and he believes his relationship with the former Canada head coach was the reason.

Me and John had some really tough conversations where he blatantly told me I wasn’t good enough to be part of the team. That was hard for me to accept,” Kaye said to Sportsnet, after also posting to social media an honest self-reflection following his New England Revolution's elimination from the MLS playoffs a week ago.

Heartfelt post by Mark-Anthony Kaye.

Jamaica vs Canada lineups & team news

Jamaica manager Hallgrimsson also described his side as being on a mission, but they faced it without New York Red Bulls forward Cory Burke because of a groin problem.

Karoy Anderson, who plays for English club Charlton Athletic, was called up for the first time. ""I was just shocked,"" the midfielder told the Addicks' website. ""I was looking at it for a long time just taking it in and I told my mum and she started crying.""

sports,Connor Andrews,2023-10-16T21:00:00+00:00,"Jim Ratcliffe’s move to Monaco in 2020 may have been bad news for the British taxpayer, but not for Manchester United fans.

The chemical billionaire looks set to buy a 25 per cent stake in the Premier League giants after fellow bidder, Sheikh Jassim, withdrew his offer.

6 Ratcliffe could still have a big say at United Credit: getty

6 His wisest move could be to land his old neighbour Mitchell

That news hasn’t been too warmly welcomed by United supporters, who would still have to put up with the hugely unpopular Glazer family in control of the club.

It could, though, mean some sort of progress, if the Manchester born Ratcliffe follows through with his vision to revolutionise the club.

Should Ratcliffe come in, talkSPORT understands that he would take charge of footballing matters, something the Glazers have been accused of having little to no interest in.

Already a top tier European owner of OGC Nice, there has been some success, but nothing compared to their French riviera neighbours, where Ratcliffe appears set to look for inspiration.

Paul Mitchell recently left the principality of Monaco, but he could well be back there in meetings with Ratcliffe who is planning to appoint a sporting director.

Mitchell fulfilled that role at Monaco after previous stints at Leipzig, Tottenham, Southampton and MK Dons, becoming one of football’s most respected executives.

A former player in England’s lower leagues, Mitchell was previously linked with Chelsea and Liverpool, and much like Ratcliffe, he’s also from Greater Manchester.

Starring mainly for Wigan and MK Dons, it was with the latter where Mitchell was moved upstairs, and made his first big move by spotting future England regular Dele Alli after being named their head of recruitment in 2010.

Two years later he joined Southampton in the same role, and that’s where he really began to show off, landing the Saints a number of players who would not only go on to become Champions League regulars, but make the club a fortune and ensure a Premier League best finish.

Showcasing his skills in casting his scouting net far and wide, Sadio Mane, Dusan Tadic, Graziano Pelle, Dejan Lovren and Victor Wanyama all went on to secure Southampton a bright future, and Mitchell a promotion to Tottenham in 2014.

6 Mane was one of Mitchell's early successes

6 But there's been many more Credit: Getty

The north London side had just unsuccessfully splurged their world record £85million from Real Madrid for Gareth Bale, and it looked like Mitchell couldn’t have picked a worse time.

However, names such as Alli, Heung-Min Son, Toby Alderweireld, Eric Dier and Kieran Trippier set the side up for a bright future, before chairman Daniel Levy got in Mitchell’s way.

Leaving what he called his ‘dream job’ after less than two years, it was reportedly due to Levy’s over-involvement in negotiations and the recruitment process, something which wasn’t an issue at his next club – Leipzig.

Ralf Rangnick landed Mitchell and more success followed. Signings such as Dani Olmo, Christopher Nkunku and Amadou Haidara again showcased what Mitchell can do with the shackles off, and again the results followed.

6 Getting Nkunku from PSG was one of Mitchell's biggest coups Credit: Getty

Many of his signings starred in a run to the Champions League semi-finals in 2020, and in 2022 won the club’s first ever trophy with a DFB Pokal.

Only leaving the side to reach the pinnacle of his job, finally stepping up from a head of recruitment to become sporting director at Monaco, Mitchell showed just how big picture he is with an interview in 2021.

“I want to continue to drive standards in each and every department,” he said. “Psychology, sports science, nutrition, medicine, the way we travel, the way we refuel.

“Everything, every element I think we need to keep pushing to its maximum to try and be the best we possibly can.”

Having worked in football management for over a decade, Mitchell’s career has always been about the long term for his club’s, with the young signings he’s made often only paying off after he’s left.

One in particular was 2022/23 Premier League top scorer Son, who perfectly sums up his philosophy.

“I took quite a lot of criticism in my first year at Tottenham for some of the decisions and Sonny was kind of at the centre of that,” he explained.

“Sometimes players need time, they’re human beings, they need to settle, Sonny had a great track record at Hamburg and Leverkusen but there was this narrative that started to grow internally and externally that he wasn’t a good finisher.

6 Mitchell is becoming an increasingly recognisable face

“I remember telling a coach ‘you’re wrong, his history shows in two different clubs he’s a very astute finisher off both sides’.”

Mitchell remains good friends with Rangnick from their time together at Leipzig, and last season made headlines when he was spotted at a youth team game while the German was interim coach at Man United.

So astute is Mitchell in his observations, he even laid out a blueprint for United's success while at Monaco.

“I think context is important to measure what Manchester United's current situation is, but I think they do need to get to the point of really putting down what Manchester United needs to be in the modern game,” he explained.

""We are a long time from the Sir Alex Ferguson era. Erik ten Hag is a top coach from Ajax but they need a top blueprint not only for now but for the next five years, and work towards that, and sometimes on that journey there are hard moments when you don't get the right results, even though you're doing the right things.

""You have to know that, over that period, the consistency of the decision-making will yield a good end result. I think we've seen that both Manchester City and Liverpool, that when you adopt that long-term strategy you can get real consistency and sustainable success.

""I think that's the biggest thing for Manchester United; putting down their identity of what they want to be today, but most crucially what they want to be in five years' time, and where they want to be, and what they want to look like; from everything from young players, to the style of play, to the whole culture peace in Manchester United.""

Almost certain to consult Rangnick before any approach from Ratcliffe, Mitchell may be warned off of a club where long-term thinking hasn’t existed.

But, should Ratcliffe get his man, it could signal exactly the change in fortunes he and every supporter has been hoping for at Manchester United.","Paul Mitchell signed Tottenham and Chelsea superstars, fell out with Daniel Levy and has tailor-made plan for Manchester United",https://talksport.com/football/1603721/paul-mitchell-man-united-sporting-director-jim-ratcliffe-takeover/,TalkSport
sports,Jonathan Burnett,2023-10-20T22:00:05+00:00,"The 2019 Rugby World Cup final between England and South Africa was one of many firsts: the game itself capped off a sensational tournament played outside of the sport's traditional strongholds for the first time; it was the first final in which South Africa scored a try, and by full-time, the 32-12 score in the Springboks' favour sealed a record-equalling third title for the Rainbow Nation.

Fast forward four years, and South Africa once again prepare to take on England in an all-or-nothing match to decide which nation gets a shot at World Cup glory — but this time around, the pair meet in the semi-finals of the 2023 tournament, rather than the decider.

That won't make an ounce of difference for either camp, though, as these two long-time rivals prepare for a battle that could re-define the definition of a 'physical encounter.'

England are the only side still competing who are yet to lose a game, and that will stand them in good stead coming into this semi-final. Dominant wins over Argentina, Japan and Chile sealed passage to the last eight, and after being given an almighty scare by Samoa in their final pool match, England overcame a Fijian fightback in Marseille to triumph 30-24. Despite being outscored by three tries to two, captain Owen Farrell kicked 20 points, sending his side into the last four at the expense of 2023's breakout stars.

The Springboks have done it tough, too, having already faced two of the tournament favourites on their way to the semi-finals. Comfortable defeats of Scotland, Romania and Tonga couldn't mask the disappointment of the 13-8 loss to Ireland, which consigned South Africa to second in Pool B. However, with Ireland sent home by the All Blacks in the quarters, the Bokke showed their World Cup mettle to edge the hosts 29-28 at the Stade de France, sneaking past Les Bleus in one of the best games of rugby you're ever likely to see.

Both sides' journeys have seen twists, turns, and bumps in the road, but it's led them both to within 80 minutes of a Rugby World Cup final. England will no doubt be looking to echo the spirit of 2019, when they beat the All Blacks 19-7 to reach the final, but in South Africa, they face a side who have taken their game to new heights just to reach the semis.

Marcus Smith hardly put a foot wrong at fullback against Fiji, but the world champions are an entirely different proposition for England to deal with at the back. The high-ball security and hulking frame of Freddie Steward returns to the No. 15 jersey in one of three changes, while at inside centre, Manu Tuilagi starts hoping to repeat his heroics of four years ago, when his early try in a dominant semi-final performance took England past the All Blacks.

England's other two changes come in the tight five, with Steve Borthwick making some big calls ahead of this game. Joe Marler starts ahead of vice-captain Ellis Genge at loosehead prop, and Ollie Chessum is replaced in the second-row by George Martin. The latter is winning only his seventh England cap but gets the starting nod alongside Maro Itoje, with Genge, Chessum and the rest of the replacements hoping to make an impact sizeable enough to overcome the Springboks' infamous 'bomb squad'.

Their time is now 🙌

England starting XV: Freddie Steward, Jonny May, Joe Marchant, Manu Tuilagi, Elliot Daly, Owen Farrell, Alex Mitchell; Joe Marler, Jamie George, Dan Cole, Maro Itoje, George Martin, Courtney Lawes, Tom Curry, Ben Earl.

England replacements: Theo Dan, Ellis Genge, Kyle Sinckler, Ollie Chessum, Billy Vunipola, Danny Care, George Ford, Ollie Lawrence.

The Springboks are unchanged from that epic quarter-final with France, having all played their part as Jacques Nienaber's side hung on in the second half. The contribution of backs Kurt-Lee Arendse, Damian de Allende and Cheslin Kolbe saw all three cross for first-half tries, with Kolbe's coming off the back of a charged-down conversion from France's Thomas Ramos. Preventing those two points proved crucial in the end.

The key contribution, though, came from Eben Etzebeth, who bulldozed his way over to score the only five-pointer of the second half and wrestle the game back into South African hands. He and Franco Mostert pack down together in the second row, while hooker Bongi Mbonambi, utility Deon Fourie, veteran Duane Vermeulen and the devilish Kwagga Smith will all be looking to back up superb quarter-final performances to take the Springboks to a second consecutive World Cup final.

South Africa starting XV: Damian Willemse, Kurt-Lee Arendse, Jesse Kriel, Damian de Allende, Cheslin Kolbe, Manie Libbok, Cobus Reinach; Steven Kitshoff, Bongi Mbonambi, Frans Malherbe, Eben Etzebeth, Franco Mostert, Siya Kolisi, Pieter-Steph du Toit, Duane Vermeulen.

South Africa replacements: Deon Fourie, Ox Nche, Vincent Koch, RG Snyman, Kwagga Smith, Faf de Klerk, Handre Pollard, Willie le Roux.

England vs. South Africa betting odds, prediction

The last time these two sides met was a tumultuous period to say the least, particularly for English rugby. South Africa's dominant 27-13 victory at Twickenham proved to be the last game in charge for Eddie Jones, the coach who had taken England to the 2019 World Cup final. In his place, Steve Borthwick was hired, and he's just one game away from repeating that feat.

England's form at this tournament has been perfect — at face value. Argentina, Japan, Chile, Samoa and Fiji have all provided highlights — Los Pumas are also in the semi-finals — and England have beaten all of them. However, only Japan and Chile were defeated with bonus points, and the narrow wins over both Samoa and Fiji in their last two games showed that England are certainly gettable.

In short, this semi-final requires a huge step up in quality for Borthwick's side, and that's why we think that the Springboks will be victorious at the Stade de France. South Africa have already shown they can match, and beat, the world's best, and we think that they'll do the latter in Saint-Denis.","Where to watch England vs South Africa: Live stream, TV channel, lineups, odds for 2023 Rugby World Cup semifinal",https://www.sportingnews.com/us/rugby-union/news/watch-england-vs-south-africa-stream-channel-rugby-world-cup/20ce7b361138e7c1a1574572,Sporting News

S﻿AINT-ETIENNE: The Wallabies will have to endure a more tortuous Sunday night watch than even the worst rom com as their Rugby World Cup fate is decided by Fiji and Portugal in Toulouse.

Australia will gather together in their plush Saint-Galmier hotel at 9pm local time (6am Monday AEDT) to view what will almost certainly be their World Cup execution.

The Wallabies are currently sitting second in Pool C but a single bonus point would be enough for Fiji to leapfrog them and advance to the quarter-finals in Marseille.

The most likely outcome is that Fiji wins easily and the Wallabies will be pushing confirm on their off-season holiday plans.﻿

""We've only got ourselves to blame, we put ourselves in this position,"" Wallabies centre Samu Kerevi, who was born in Fiji, said after an open training session in front of 1000 keen locals at the Andrezieux-Boutheon rugby club on Saturday.

""We'll sit down as a team and watch together on Sunday night. I think we understand the situation ... our results and the way we played, we put ourselves in this position. So the team understands that and we have our belief in anything's possible at the World Cup.

""But also, we understand how strong Fiji is. And we're proud for them as a proud nation. For myself, I'll be proud of it either way it goes. We'll be ready if it comes our way.""

Kerevi was photographed holding his face in disbelief in one of the defining images of the World Cup ﻿after the Wallabies were pumped 40-6 by Wales in Lyon.

The 30-year-old is undoubtedly one of the world's finest centres in peak form but injuries conspired to limit his potential in France.﻿

""I don't think I performed where I wanted to perform at a World Cup,"" Kerevi said.

""I hold myself to high standards and I just felt like I could have helped the team more in certain aspects ... I've been out of the game for nine months but I felt good coming into it ... I just felt like I was blowing a bit, but felt good towards the back end of a couple of games. But again, it's not where I want my performance to be.

Despite being dropped for Lalakai Foketi for the pool win against Portugal, Kerevi said he had no thoughts of following fellow Fijian-Wallaby ﻿Marika Koroibete into international retirement.

He wanted to regain form at club level ﻿with Urayasu D-Rocks but his hand remained up for Test selection.

""I chose to leave Australian shores and understand the ruling around that and what it holds,"" he said.

""I've got to perform for my club first and if you get the call up, you get the call up. If you don't, I'll take my three months break and enjoy that.""

Kerevi is an unabashed Jones fan.

""He's up at 4am working hard. We catch him in the gym, he's working hard and I swear he doesn't even sleep. Seriously, the amount of time he puts into effort, into his staff, into the players, always has time for us ... and I think fans don't see that,"" he said.

""At the end of the day, we didn't get the results, you know, we didn't perform the way we wanted to as a team and it's not on Eddie - it's on all of us.

""So I understand what the fans feel and they're just passionate and it's awesome to have that. But no-one realises what goes on inside. No-one realises the things that we're working on tirelessly, to work hard, but especially him and the staff, f--ing work so hard, bro.

""They're away from families, they're sacrificing as well and … I don't read into the comment stuff, but the young boys, I hear a lot that's going on, social media and stuff. But I don't think people really understand demons, everyone's fights in between.

""Eddie's a human as well and at the end of the day it's a results-driven sport, you know, we need results to get that. But he's committed to us and we love that about him.

""He hasn't thought about going home, he's thought about how we can contribute best and that's what we've done these last three days. I feel for him, you know, like as a head coach, you maybe can't show that side of himself.

Eddie Jones and Will Skelton talk at Stade Roger Baudras. (Getty)

""But he's been so strong for us and gives us strength to just be positive. And again, we put ourselves in this situation.""

Wide World of Sports also asked Kerevi to deliver a message to disillusioned Wallabies fans.﻿

""I think at home there's so many sports going on and some saying rugby's dying, but rugby's massive here overseas,"" he said.

""Last week 45,000 fans (versus Portugal), last night (60,000 in Lyon). Rugby's such a small aspect in terms of Australians but our fans have turned up here, we've seen them and spoken to them and their unconditional love for us, the fact that they came 20,000km to get here and support us, has been awesome.

""My message is just to understand that we're working extremely hard, there's no stone unturned, especially the youth in this team, to leave the jersey in a better place and just to stick with us.

""I know the results haven't been coming our way the last couple of years but when it does turn, that's what we're building towards.﻿""",The story behind anguished Wallabies star's photo,https://wwos.nine.com.au/rugby/world-cup-2023-news-fiji-vs-portugal-wallabies-watch-on-samu-kerevi-interview/9a78381c-57a8-4005-b911-86fe3b74c469,Wide World Of Sports
sports,Tony Harper,2023-11-13T23:01:20+00:00,"In March last year Graham Arnold seemed a dead man walking – the Socceroos World Cup qualification campaign was lurching towards failure and the manager was being battered from all sides.

Arnold’s team had finished seven points off automatic qualification for Qatar after a shocking run of one win in seven games left them facing a Asian playoff against United Arab Emirates and then another against Peru to make the finals.

While rumours swirled and ex-players and fans bayed for his blood, Football Australia took the pragmatic course and stuck by Arnold. It likely had more to do with the lateness of the hour and financial considerations than any overwhelming faith in Arnie to run around the fortunes.

Facebook Twitter Whatsapp Reddit Email Share

But he did just that with qualification – and an excellent run at the finals – bowing out to the eventual champions Argentina and after nearly taking them to extra time.

He got to answer critics like Mark Bosnich and Craig Foster as well – bluntly rejecting their negativity with the dismissive “who cares?”. That would have tasted sweet.

On Tuesday, FA CEO James Johnson, who held firm on Arnold 20 months ago, got to congratulate the coach on his impending record-breaking match against Bangladesh as 2026 World Cup qualifying starts on Thursday.

“Graham is one of the greatest contributors to the Socceroos,” Johnson said in a statement.

“He’s been a constant in the Australian football landscape for more than 30 years as both a player and coach, being a part of some of the Socceroos most memorable moments.

“Anyone who knows Arnie will tell you he bleeds green and gold. His love for the Socceroos and football in Australia is both infectious and inspiring. That energy and passion is a huge element to the way he’s able to lead and inspire our nation’s best male footballers in some of our sport’s most challenging arenas.

“On behalf of Football Australia, I’d like to congratulate Arnie on everything he’s achieved in reaching this milestone and we look forward to him continuing to build on what is already an exceptional legacy.”

In a remarkable few weeks last year Arnold went from on the nose to a man revived. Since then he’s been linked to club jobs in Europe but opted to stick around with the national team.

While national team coaches make important calls every game, Arnold’s record-breaking achievement is conceivably down to one big ballsy call in the playoff against Peru.

With moments left in extra time against the South Americans, Arnold dragged Mat Ryan and replaced him with Andrew Redmayne – who saved the decisive spot kick (and also threw his opponents water bottle with cheat sheet attached away from the goal).

Ryan might well have gotten the Socceroos to Qatar, but if Australia had not advanced there’s little chance Arnold would still be their coach today.

And there’s virtually no chance he’ll have to endure a similar level of stress through to the next finals – with FIFA expanding the tournament from 36 to 48 teams meaning eight direct Asian confederation qualifiers will proceed directly instead of four.

Arnold, in his second stint as national team manager, will prowl the technical area for a 59th time on Thursday, taking him clear of Frank Farina.

Arnold – who also represented the Socceroos 56 times as a player – has been involved in national team coaching ranks since 2000, first as an assistant to Farina and then Guus Hiddink, before a brief period as caretaker coach in 2006.

“It’s certainly a proud moment and an achievement that I’ll reflect on when the time is right,” Arnold said.

“I look at some of the names on that list – Farina, Arok, Thompson, Rasic – guys I played under or assisted in the early part of my coaching career, and it gives you some perspective on what a journey it’s been so far.

“I think back to that caretaker period and how much I learnt about coaching; it was a challenging experience and one that on reflection I probably wasn’t ready for. I’m grateful for the opportunity I was given and what it was able to teach me ahead of my pathway into club coaching.

“I was able to put lessons from that time into practice, develop and eventually return to the Socceroos much more prepared for the role. It’s been a privilege to be part of the national team again with the benefit of that experience, and I’m immensely proud of what this group has been able to achieve in the last four years.

“In my opinion, there’s no greater honour than representing your nation on the international stage. I look at the young players coming through the Socceroos system now full of pride in the work they’ve put in to get where they are, and the journey that’s ahead of them.

“I’ve always loved being a part of the Socceroos culture and my desire to see Australia fulfil its footballing potential is still driving me to take this group to further success.”

Australia starts the road to north America in Melbourne at AAMI Park on Thursday night, before travelling to the Middle East to play Palestine next Wednesday (1.00am AEDT).

For this stage of qualifiers there are nine groups of four teams, with Lebanon the other team in Group I.

The top two teams from each group will advance into three groups of six for the next stage. The top two from those games – from September 2024 to June 2025 – will directly advance to the play offs with another qualifying round to determine the seventh and eight direct qualifiers.",‘Bleeds green and gold’: Ballsy career-saving call that’s delivered Arnie a record-breaking moment,https://www.theroar.com.au/2023/11/14/bleeds-green-and-gold-ballsy-career-saving-call-thats-delivered-arnie-a-record-breaking-moment/,The Roar | Sports Writers Blog

“You are not representing yourself today. You are fighting for the things that happen in South Africa.

“You are tackling for the boy who didn’t get the same opportunities that you got eventually.”

Four years later and the “ego” Erasmus spoke about is what is driving the standards and expectations around the Springboks’ bid to go back-to-back.

“We explain to the whole squad why we are going a certain route. It is not about individual selection,” Springboks coach Jacques Nienaber said shortly after announcing two changes to his starting side and five in total, after going in with a forwards-heavy 7-1 bench split.

“It is for South Africa. As selectors we know there will be pressure on us if we don’t deliver a result but at the back of our minds we know this selection is for South Africa.

“The players take it like that. It is not about person or ego, not that they have egos, but you can’t think of that. You have to think about South Africa and the Springboks.”

Seemingly the Springboks are playing for more than themselves. They’re playing for their country.

It’s a powerful force, one that saw them progress through the knockout stages to reach the final after consecutive one-point victories.

Pressure? The South African laughs at the notion of what pressure is compared to the inequality and challenges the Rainbow Nation continues to experience.

The question is: how can New Zealand’s All Blacks withstand and overcome the hitherto unshakable wave of momentum and spirit the Springboks play with under Erasmus in this weekend’s World Cup final?

It would seem that, as the Springboks play for their country, the All Blacks are playing for themselves as much as anyone – and the generation of players and leaders that will call time on their international careers at week’s end.

The backlash and toxicity that followed their historic home series loss to Ireland was a humbling and public reminder of the expectation of being an All Black.

It’s why Saturday’s World Cup final is personal for the men wearing black.

All Blacks social media managers were forced to delete a thousand comments an hour following the humbling series loss in Wellington.

The pain of the days and weeks after that dark July, as well as the bumps and bruises along the way, including as recently as August when they suffered their biggest defeat to the Boks to lose the inaugural and prestigious Qatar Cup, still runs deep.

“It was quite special to hear some of the things those certain players said from the heart. You know, you think you know someone but once they open up and really be vulnerable in front of a team, it was quite special to hear,” back-rower Dalton Papali’i said this week.



“It was truly something special when you hear those boys open up. You know those leaders have been through a lot in their careers, the highs and the lows, the off-field and on-field stuff, and for them to open up, it sort of makes you feel welcomed and you want to play this game for them.



“There were a few tears and I think that’s awesome to see, players showing vulnerability, just opening up about how much this tour and this sort of game means.



“There were some (people) saying this is probably one of the most important games of All Blacks history. (The) All Blacks went through a bit of a hard path to get here, media, friends, family even criticising us and all that, and we stuck together. We weren’t even said to be in the final and now look at us, we’re here.

“Different players take it differently and some of the older players probably were hit a little bit harder and it was good to see just a bit of emotion and the want from them. Seeing that gives all the other players an extra two, three per cent to think ‘OK, we are going to the well and we’ve got to give it our all’.”

The All Blacks will experience a changing of the guard next season.

Indeed, the All Blacks’ social media channels described the team selection for the World Cup final as the “Last Dance”.

2015 World Cup winner Dane Coles will call time on his career, while his tight-five teammates Brodie Retallick and Sam Whitelock, who is bidding to become the first player to win the Webb Ellis Cup for a third time, will head overseas.

Fellow World Cup winners Aaron Smith and Beauden Barrett will also head to Japan.

Coles, who was labelled by Samisoni Taukei’aho as a “Grandad” type figure in the All Blacks, has even been denied the chance of a farewell send-off after missing selection.

“Yeah, tough,” said coach Ian Foster of the conversation with the 36-year-old around leaving him out.

“We don’t want to talk too much about post-game stuff, but that was a tough one, probably the toughest I have had as a coach. He took it the way I expected him to. He’s a champion.”

Papali’i said the All Blacks were intent on sending their leaders out on a high.

“There’s a few leaders in the team, it’s going to be their last game in the jersey, so it’s a big game for us and even the other players that are staying, knowing that we want to send those boys out on a high,” he said.

“How much they put into the jersey. We are standing on their…what’s that quote? It’s standing on the shoulders of giants.”

The generational change isn’t just occurring on the field but off it, too.

Foster will depart the All Blacks set up after 12 years, the last four as head coach.

It’s been far from smooth, having overseen their historic defeats to Argentina as well as the 2-1 series loss to Ireland on home soil.

A famous 35-23 win over the Springboks at Ellis Park saw him save his career, with Scott Robertson being lined up on the side.

But it wasn’t enough for New Zealand Rugby to back him before this year’s Test season got underway, with Robertson announced as Foster’s successor.

“Am I at peace?” Foster repeated a question during his World Cup team announcement when asked about where his mental state was ahead of his last Test in charge of the All Blacks.

“Yeah, I’m reasonably peaceful. I love the word but I’m not sure I’m peaceful right now.”

Advertisement

He added: “I’ve just started to get my back nice and straight from last year and now you’re trying to make me hunched over again!

“It’s the life of this business, it’s a tough game. It’s tough when you’re trying to get your performance right. It’s a tough game when people around you see things differently, but we’ve learned a lot about ourselves.

“We take massive pride in the jersey and making sure we reach the levels we want to. The rest of that is probably a conversation for another day.

“It hasn’t altered our vision of where we want this team to be. I know we’ve surprised a few people but I don’t think we’ve surprised ourselves.”","Legacy vs ego: The Springboks are playing for South Africa, the All Blacks are playing for themselves",https://www.theroar.com.au/2023/10/27/legacy-vs-ego-the-springboks-are-playing-for-south-africa-the-all-blacks-are-playing-for-themselves/,The Roar | Sports Writers Blog
sports,Josh Edwards,2023-11-17T20:07:09+00:00,"From From Carolina Panthers Round 1 - Pick 1 Caleb Williams QB USC • Jr • 6'1"" / 215 lbs Projected Team Chicago PROSPECT RNK 2nd POSITION RNK 1st Justin Fields is expected to return to the field this week, but is it too little, too late? Chicago will have a chance to take a quarterback No. 1 overall and it may be too much to pass up a second consecutive year.

Round 1 - Pick 2 Drake Maye QB North Carolina • Soph • 6'4"" / 230 lbs Projected Team N.Y. Giants PROSPECT RNK 5th POSITION RNK 2nd There was doubt about Daniel Jones' viability as a long-term starter when he signed his extension. Following his ACL injury, there is no less concern. New York will have to eat a grandiose amount of dead salary cap but it is a small price to pay if Drake Maye ends up being the quarterback many expect he could be.

Round 1 - Pick 3 Marvin Harrison Jr. WR Ohio State • Jr • 6'4"" / 205 lbs Projected Team New England PROSPECT RNK 1st POSITION RNK 1st Marvin Harrison Jr. is arguably the best talent available in the 2024 NFL Draft, but does that matter if he is catching passes from Mac Jones or Bailey Zappe? The Patriots have to be hopeful that they find themselves in a position to draft one of the two top quarterback prospects.

Round 1 - Pick 4 Olumuyiwa Fashanu OT Penn State • Jr • 6'6"" / 317 lbs Projected Team Arizona PROSPECT RNK 3rd POSITION RNK 1st When a new homeowner moves in, they often have a different vision of how to decorate the space. Jonathan Gannon and Monti Ossenfort are the new homeowners and they could move on from D.J. Humphries and save money toward the salary cap while likely upgrading at the position.

Round 1 - Pick 5 Dallas Turner EDGE Alabama • Jr • 6'4"" / 252 lbs Projected Team Chicago PROSPECT RNK 14th POSITION RNK 3rd Chicago traded for and signed Montez Sweat to a lucrative contract extension but Yannick Ngakoue has given them nothing. The addition of Dallas Turner allows them to have a potentially dynamic duo.

Round 1 - Pick 6 Joe Alt OT Notre Dame • Jr • 6'7"" / 322 lbs Projected Team Green Bay PROSPECT RNK 7th POSITION RNK 3rd The David Bakhtiari experience may be over in Green Bay but there is a tantalizing off-ramp with the addition of Joe Alt.

Round 1 - Pick 7 JC Latham OT Alabama • Jr • 6'6"" / 360 lbs Projected Team L.A. Rams PROSPECT RNK 6th POSITION RNK 2nd Los Angeles' offensive tackles have had two of the highest beaten rates in the NFL this season, according to TruMedia. JC Latham allows them to upgrade on one side of the line.

Round 1 - Pick 8 Brock Bowers TE Georgia • Jr • 6'4"" / 240 lbs Projected Team Tennessee PROSPECT RNK 4th POSITION RNK 1st Brock Bowers is the lone remaining blue-chip talent. If Will Levis is the future then they need to surround him with the skill talent that may give him a chance to succeed.

Round 1 - Pick 9 Jared Verse EDGE Florida State • Jr • 6'4"" / 260 lbs Projected Team Atlanta PROSPECT RNK 12th POSITION RNK 2nd Atlanta likes heavy-handed pass rushers who can set the edge and Jared Verse falls into that category. The Falcons have added some older veterans at the position but it is not a viable long-term solution.

Round 1 - Pick 10 Laiatu Latu EDGE UCLA • Sr • 6'5"" / 265 lbs Projected Team Washington PROSPECT RNK 11th POSITION RNK 1st After moving on from Chase Young and Montez Sweat, Washington has a need for rushing the passer. Laiatu Latu may end up being the best out of this draft class.

Round 1 - Pick 11 J.J. McCarthy QB Michigan • Jr • 6'3"" / 202 lbs Projected Team Tampa Bay PROSPECT RNK 21st POSITION RNK 4th Baker Mayfield is replaced in Tampa Bay with J.J. McCarthy. It was a Michigan quarterback that led the Buccaneers to the promised land last time so perhaps lightning strikes twice.

Round 1 - Pick 12 Amarius Mims OT Georgia • Jr • 6'7"" / 340 lbs Projected Team N.Y. Jets PROSPECT RNK 23rd POSITION RNK 4th The top-10 selections were not kind to a New York team that desperately needs offensive tackle help. The Jets select Amarius Mims, who is young and inexperienced, to upgrade the ceiling of their protection.

Round 1 - Pick 13 Jer'Zhan Newton DL Illinois • Jr • 6'2"" / 295 lbs Projected Team Denver PROSPECT RNK 27th POSITION RNK 2nd Jer'Zhan Newton infuses some youth into a unit that was not long ago a strength for the Broncos. Newton is a high-motor player who will help establish the culture in Denver.

Round 1 - Pick 14 Kool-Aid McKinstry CB Alabama • Jr • 6'1"" / 195 lbs Projected Team L.A. Chargers PROSPECT RNK 9th POSITION RNK 2nd J.C. Jackson never became what the Chargers had hoped when they signed him. His spot in the lineup has not been filled with a long-term candidate. Kool-Aid McKinstry is a good value midway through the first round.

Round 1 - Pick 15 Malik Nabers WR LSU • Jr • 6'0"" / 200 lbs Projected Team Indianapolis PROSPECT RNK 13th POSITION RNK 2nd Michael Pittman Jr. is scheduled to be a free agent at season's end. If the two parties can not come to terms, Malik Nabers is a good partner for Josh Downs.

Round 1 - Pick 16 Nate Wiggins CB Clemson • Jr • 6'2"" / 185 lbs Projected Team Las Vegas PROSPECT RNK 19th POSITION RNK 3rd The thought of Las Vegas taking another cornerback in the first round has to be terrifying for Raiders fans but the reality is that it remains a position of need for the AFC franchise despite adding Patriots castoff Jack Jones this week.

Round 1 - Pick 17 Cooper DeJean CB Iowa • Jr • 6'1"" / 207 lbs Projected Team Buffalo PROSPECT RNK 38th POSITION RNK 7th It was learned Wednesday that Cooper DeJean's season, and potentially Iowa career, is over. Buffalo adds him in the first round to fill out its secondary.

Round 1 - Pick 18 Keon Coleman WR Florida State • Jr • 6'4"" / 215 lbs Projected Team Cincinnati PROSPECT RNK 16th POSITION RNK 3rd Tee Higgins and Cincinnati will likely part ways after the season, which creates a need in that offense. Keon Coleman is a big-bodied receiver who can win jump balls down the field.

Round 1 - Pick 19 JT Tuimoloau EDGE Ohio State • Jr • 6'4"" / 270 lbs Projected Team New Orleans PROSPECT RNK 15th POSITION RNK 4th New Orleans adds a powerful rusher to its repertoire. Cam Jordan is 34 years old and has two years remaining on his contract. The Saints have a quality rotation of rushers until JT Tuimoloau eventually takes over.

From From Houston Texans Round 1 - Pick 20 Chop Robinson EDGE Penn State • Jr • 6'3"" / 254 lbs Projected Team Arizona PROSPECT RNK 29th POSITION RNK 6th Arizona adds an edge rusher with higher upside to Jonathan Gannon's defense.

Round 1 - Pick 21 Jayden Daniels QB LSU • Sr • 6'4"" / 210 lbs Projected Team Minnesota PROSPECT RNK 76th POSITION RNK 8th The Joshua Dobbs story has been fun but the reality is that Kirk Cousins will be a free agent after the season and the organization could opt for a change. Jayden Daniels has been one of the most productive quarterbacks in football.

Round 1 - Pick 22 Emeka Egbuka WR Ohio State • Jr • 6'1"" / 206 lbs Projected Team Dallas PROSPECT RNK 20th POSITION RNK 4th Dallas retools at wide receiver with CeeDee Lamb and Emeka Egbuka. The franchise has struggled to find a reliable complement to Lamb since the departure of Amari Cooper.

Round 1 - Pick 23 Taliese Fuaga OL Oregon State • Jr • 6'6"" / 334 lbs Projected Team Pittsburgh PROSPECT RNK 17th POSITION RNK 1st Pittsburgh probably has some offensive soul-searching ahead but there is no question that the addition of more protection is a sound investment.

From From Cleveland Browns Round 1 - Pick 24 Bralen Trice EDGE Washington • Jr • 6'4"" / 274 lbs Projected Team Houston PROSPECT RNK 26th POSITION RNK 5th DeMeco Ryans is not going to settle for one or two pass rushers. He wants an Army. Bralen Trice paired with Jonathan Greenard and Will Anderson Jr. is a solid foundation.

Round 1 - Pick 25 Denzel Burke CB Ohio State • Jr • 6'1"" / 190 lbs Projected Team Miami PROSPECT RNK 36th POSITION RNK 6th Injuries have plagued Miami's cornerback room. So the Dolphins add more depth in the form of Ohio State's Denzel Burke.

Round 1 - Pick 26 Tyler Nubin S Minnesota • Sr • 6'2"" / 210 lbs Projected Team Seattle PROSPECT RNK 44th POSITION RNK 2nd Seattle adds a ballhawk who can help capitalize on the chaos created by a surprisingly active defensive front over the past month. The Seahawks have already invested in the unit with the additions of Riq Woolen and Devon Witherspoon in back-to-back years.

Round 1 - Pick 27 Rome Odunze WR Washington • Jr • 6'3"" / 215 lbs Projected Team Jacksonville PROSPECT RNK 31st POSITION RNK 6th Jacksonville clears the deck and starts anew with Calvin Ridley and Rome Odunze. The Jaguars have to figure out their protection issues this offseason, though.

Round 1 - Pick 28 Kingsley Suamataia OT BYU • Soph • 6'6"" / 325 lbs Projected Team San Francisco PROSPECT RNK 37th POSITION RNK 7th San Francisco needs to make multiple changes to its offensive line this offseason. Replacing Colton McKivitz with Kingsley Suamataia is Stage 1 of the transformation.

Round 1 - Pick 29 Kalen King CB Penn State • Jr • 5'11"" / 190 lbs Projected Team Baltimore PROSPECT RNK 8th POSITION RNK 1st Marlon Humphrey and the entire Baltimore secondary has struggled to stay healthy. Kalen King adds some depth to the unit.

Round 1 - Pick 30 Graham Barton OT Duke • Sr • 6'5"" / 314 lbs Projected Team Detroit PROSPECT RNK 35th POSITION RNK 6th Jonah Jackson and Halapoulivaati Vaitai are slated to hit free agency. If one or both leave, then it creates a void in Detroit's offensive line. Enter Graham Barton, who has played left tackle for the Blue Devils but projects inside.

Round 1 - Pick 31 Kris Jenkins DL Michigan • Sr • 6'3"" / 305 lbs Projected Team Kansas City PROSPECT RNK 43rd POSITION RNK 5th Kansas City adds depth to its interior defensive line with the addition of Michigan's Kris Jenkins.","2024 NFL Mock Draft: Bengals' Joe Burrow gets another playmaker; four QBs go in Round 1, but Pats opt for WR",https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/draft/news/2024-nfl-mock-draft-bengals-joe-burrow-gets-another-playmaker-four-qbs-go-in-round-1-but-pats-opt-for-wr/,CBSSports.com

An investigation into Michigan's alleged sign-stealing scheme, centered on now-fired staffer Connor Stalions, continues to evolve by the hour, with one update after another adding another wrinkle to the saga that began in October. The Big Ten suspended coach Jim Harbaugh for three games on Friday with the team on a plane en route to Penn State, and although Michigan had hoped to block the suspension, the Wolverines will be without their coach on the sidelines in Happy Valley.

The Sporting News is tracking the latest updates from the Michigan sign-stealing scandal. Follow along with the newest developments below.

Michigan sign-stealing scandal updates

Michigan fires coach connected to destroying evidence in investigation

Yahoo Sports' Ross Dellenger and Dan Wetzel reported on Friday that the NCAA's investigation into the sign-stealing and advanced scouting operation has found that Stalions was at least partially funded by a Michigan booster, named as ""Uncle T,"" and that linebackers coach Chris Partridge, who was fired by Michigan on Friday, is alleged to have destroyed evidence on a computer pertaining to the sign-stealing allegations.

The report states Partridge is not believed to have had prior knowledge of the sign-stealing operation, but then later worked to cover it up. In a statement on his firing, Michigan appeared to indicate a connection between Partridge and the NCAA's investigation, which Dellenger and Wetzel reported is still in the early stage:

From the outset, our focus has been on seeking due process and allowing the NCAA to conduct a fair and deliberate investigation. Although the Big Ten has closed its investigation, we are continuing to cooperate with the NCAA as it moves forward with its ongoing investigation. Consistent with our commitment to integrity, we will continue to take the appropriate actions, including disciplinary measures, based on information we obtain. Earlier today, Michigan Athletics relieved Chris Partridge of his duties as a member of the Michigan Football staff. Due to employee privacy laws, we are unable to comment further.""

Because Michigan and Harbaugh on Thursday dropped their litigation against the Big Ten, he will not be on Michigan's sideline this week against Maryland and next week against Ohio State to end the regular season.

Former Wolverines assistant and Harbaugh confidant Biff Poggi on Friday offered his former boss an invitation. Poggi, in his first year as Charlotte's head coach, asked Harbaugh to join the 49ers for their games vs. Rice on Saturday and at South Florida on Nov. 25.

I am extending an open invitation to Jim Harbaugh to join me on the sidelines for the next two Charlotte football games. It would be my honor to stand next to you again as we did for three years — Biff poggi (@BiffPoggi) November 17, 2023

Michigan accepts Harbaugh's three-game suspension

Michigan has dropped its litigation against the Big Ten over Harbaugh's three-game suspension, and it will accept the punishment levied against the head coach.

From Michigan:

""This morning, the University, Coach Harbaugh, and the Big Ten resolved their pending litigation. The Conference agreed to close its investigation, and the University and Coach Harbaugh agreed to accept the three-game suspension. Coach Harbaugh, with the University's support, decided to accept this sanction to return the focus to our student-athletes and their performance on the field. The Conference has confirmed that it is not aware of any information suggesting Coach Harbaugh's involvement in the allegations. The University continues to cooperate fully with the NCAA's investigation.

From the Big Ten:

""The Big Ten Conference's commitment to student-athletes, sportsmanship and the commissioner's duty to protect the integrity of competition will never waver. Today's decision by the University of Michigan to withdraw its legal challenge against the conference's November 10th notice of disciplinary action is indicative of the high standards and values that the conference and the university seek to uphold, the University of Michigan is a valued member of the Big Ten Conference and the conference will continue to work cooperatively with the university and the NCAA during this process.""

Harbaugh says he'll state his case at Friday hearing

Despite the suspension, Jim Harbaugh held his usual weekly news conference Monday, though he mostly avoided addressing the only topic on anyone's mind.

He initially told reporters he would speak during a scheduled hearing Friday, but then backtracked a bit and sounded as if he wasn't committed to that course, pending legal advice.

Harbaugh said he will speak at the hearing on Friday. He said he’s looking for “due process.” Mentioned a civics class he took 40 years ago. “You’re innocent until proven guilty. I’d like that opportunity.” — Nicole Auerbach (@NicoleAuerbach) November 13, 2023

Harbaugh clarifies that he’s not sure whether he’ll testify Friday. “That’s not my dance floor,” he says. “I’ve watched a lot of shows. I’ve watched Judge Judy a lot.” — Austin Meek (@byAustinMeek) November 13, 2023

Warde Manuel issues strong statement against Big Ten

Michigan athletic director Warde Manuel did not mince words in a statement on the Big Ten's suspension of Harbaugh. He said while the program has been disappointed to hear about the allegations, it also feels that the conference skipped due process of a complete investigation in suspending Harbaugh on Friday.

Manuel described the suspension as ""completely unethical"" and ""an assault on the rights of everyone (especially in the Big Ten) to be judged by a fair and complete investigation.""

""All of the Head Coaches in the Big Ten (some who have been accused of actively participating in the trading of signals of opponents) and my Big Ten AD colleagues can rejoice today that someone was 'held accountable,' but they should be worried about the new standard of judgment (without complete investigation) that has been unleashed in this conference,"" Manuel said.

Michigan still awaiting word from Big Ten

According to ESPN's Adam Rittenberg, Michigan still hasn't heard about an impending punishment from the Big Ten as its 1 p.m. ET flight looms.

Michigan's administration has not heard from the Big Ten as of this hour, per sources. The team will begin its preparations to leave for Penn State around 1 p.m. ET.

Harbaugh still expected to fly to State College

Dinich reported earlier on Friday that punishment to Michigan could come around the time the team is expected to get on a plane and fly to Pennsylvania for its game against Penn State. But regardless of when the punishment is announced, Harbaugh's attorney, Tom Mars, reportedly told ESPN the coach will be headed to State College.

""I'm confident he's going to be on that plane one way or another,"" Mars reportedly told ESPN.

Punishment options for Michigan

Dinich has reported the punishment could be anything, ranging from ""indefinite suspension to public reprimand or lofty fine."" However, she also reported that there is potentially a limit to what the conference can do without permission from an executive board. Anything more than two games or a fine of $10,000 would require special permission.

ESPN's Adam Rittenberg reported there are a ""range of possibilities"" the Big Ten is considering as punishment for Harbaugh. The possibility of a suspension has often garnered most of the headlines, but Rittenberg reported the conference is also considering a significant fine.

While we wait ... although Big Ten has considered a suspension for Michigan coach Jim Harbaugh, it is considering a range of possibilities, including a significant fine, sources told @CFBHeather and me. Public reprimands/fines are common penalties under B1G sportsmanship policy. — Adam Rittenberg (@ESPNRittenberg) November 9, 2023

Michigan's 10-page letter to Big Ten released

Yahoo Sports' Dan Wetzel posted Michigan's full 10-page letter to the Big Ten on X (formerly Twitter). The letter outlines Michigan's belief that the Big Ten would be acting too hastily in suspending Harbaugh or levying any punishment toward Michigan before the completion of a full NCAA investigation.

In the letter, Michigan said the university has not had the chance to review all the evidence and respond, which oversteps the due process allowed for Michigan. It said Pettiti should not have unilateral authority to punish violations without first having a completed investigation and then a response from the Compliance and Reinstatement Committee, which would recommend penalties for rules violations.

Michigan noted that regarding evidence, there is nothing it is aware of to claim athletics personnel at Michigan committed the allegations, and said the rule pertaining to electronic recordings of games is limited to the use of field equipment used by the institution for the game it is currently playing. It also said Michigan has not seen much evidence, but rather has just heard a summary of second- and third-hand information.

The letter also said given the use of sign decoding by other universities, there is little reason to believe Stalions' efforts proved meaningful, and pointed out the teams' average margin of victory since Stalions was suspended. It said the information obtained is ""at most a reflection of information that teams can and easily do obtain through public and permissible sources,"" and because of that it is ""highly dubious"" that Stalions' observations would have a ""material effect on the integrity of the competition.""

The Big Ten is reviewing the ""lengthy"" official response from Michigan and Jim Harbaugh and it's unclear when a potential ruling might come down, says ESPN's Pete Thamel. His colleague Adam Rittenberg reported Wednesday that a decision was expected by Thursday.

Ohio State denies having shared Michigan's play signals with Purdue

Ohio State coach Ryan Day was asked about the allegations that Ohio State had given information about Michigan's signs to Purdue before the Big Ten championship game in 2022. He denied them forthright.

“I can tell you this right now that nobody here did any of that,” Day said, per the Columbus Dispatch. “We went through and made sure we asked all the questions and got our compliance people involved. None of that came back at all. I can answer very strongly that that did not happen.”

Michigan submits response to Big Ten

In the latest step toward a resolution, Michigan has submitted its response to the Big Ten's notice of discipline. ESPN reported earlier Wednesday that no ruling from the conference is expected until Thursday, as the Big Ten is planning to ""take time to absorb"" what Michigan has to say.

Michigan has sent its response to the Big Ten, a school official tells ESPN. Commissioner Tony Petitti now must decide how to proceed with potential discipline. — Adam Rittenberg (@ESPNRittenberg) November 8, 2023

Yahoo Sports obtained a copy of the 10-page letter sent by Michigan to the Big Ten. Within it, the school warned Big Ten commissioner Tony Pettiti against levying ""premature"" disciplinary action against Jim Harbaugh and alleged that in-person scouting and sign-stealing are commonplace across the NCAA.

""The conference should act cautiously when setting precedent given the reality that in-person scouting, collusion among opponents, and other questionable practices may well be far more prevalent than believed,"" the letter read.

Michigan also included with the letter ""two attached documents of Michigan's offensive and defensive signs allegedly stolen and shared by other Big Ten teams,"" per Yahoo Sports.

Conference awaits Michigan response

The Big Ten expects a formal response from Michigan to the notice of discipline by the end of the day Wednesday, ESPN's Pete Thamel reports. His colleague Adam Rittenberg adds that a ruling is expected to come down Thursday.

Michigan says three other Big Ten schools shared decoded Wolverines signals

While Michigan tries to navigate the storm around its program, the Wolverines are also trying to make one thing clear: they're hardly alone in trying to decipher opponents' signals.

Michigan has shared evidence with the Big Ten and NCAA showing staff members at Ohio State, Purdue and Rutgers shared intelligence on the Wolverines' signals prior to last year's Michigan-Purdue Big Ten Championship Game, The Athletic reported.

Documents breaking down Michigan's signals for numerous plays were compiled by Purdue staffers ahead of the game based on information provided by Ohio State and Rutgers football personnel, the report says. The person who supplied the documents told The Athletic he spent 10 to 12 hours per week trying to decode signals based on game video and said the practice of sharing decoded signals with other schools is common.

However, the primary difference is Michigan is accused of using in-person scouting, which has been prohibited under NCAA rules for nearly 30 years, to acquire its information.

No connection between Buckeyes coach, Michigan investigation

Ohio State coach Ryan Day and his family have no connection to the Big Ten and NCAA investigations into Michigan, Yahoo Sports reported.

A report emerged over the weekend indicating Day may have had some involvement in the probe into the Buckeyes' arch-rivals, but the NCAA told the Big Ten there are no ties that it knows of between the Ohio State coach and the investigation.

NCAA shares findings with Big Ten as Harbaugh suspension looms

Yahoo Sports reported Monday that the NCAA shared its investigation findings with the Big Ten, noting that the findings ""do not connect the in-person scouting and recording of opponents’ sidelines to Harbaugh.""

Still, the conference is considering a suspension for Harbaugh and could hand down punishments before the end of the week.

Yahoo says a multi-game suspension for Harbaugh is on the table, though Michigan is fully expected to fight a ban if one is handed down. It would be Harbaugh's second suspension of the season, as the Wolverines self-imposed a three-game ban on Harbaugh to start the season amid an NCAA investigation that found Harbaugh lied to investigators.

Saturday, Nov. 4

Harbaugh 'likely' to be suspended

According to The Athletic's Pete Thamel, the Big Ten might be getting closer to handing down a suspension for Harbaugh.

""Over the past few days, Petitti has spoken with the athletic directors, he's spoken with the presidents, he's spoken with the coaches. And the next steps appear that there will be some type of punishment for Michigan. The most likely scenario here is some type of suspension for Jim Harbaugh,"" Thamel said on ESPN's ""College GameDay.""

MORE: Why Jim Harbaugh won't find refuge in the NFL

It was reported earlier in the week that coaches were putting pressure on the Big Ten to hit Michigan with some form of punishment, with Purdue's Ryan Walters publicly calling for action and claiming the allegations are no longer simply allegations.

Harbaugh was already suspended three games at the start of the season, in a ban imposed by the school itself in an attempt to ward off a separate NCAA investigation.

Suspended football analyst Connor Stalions resigns

Michigan football analyst Connor Stalions, the focus of the NCAA's investigation, resigned on Friday night, the university confirmed.

Statement from Michigan (confirming earlier reports that Connor Stalions is no longer with the program): ""Connor Stalions resigned his position with Michigan Athletics this afternoon. We are unable to comment further regarding this personnel matter."" — Jesse Dougherty (@dougherty_jesse) November 4, 2023

In a statement, Stalions' lawyer said that his client hoped to avoid creating more distractions for Michigan and denied that any Wolverines staffer ""told anyone to break any rules.""

Stalions is accused of buying numerous tickets to scout future opponents in-person, which is against NCAA rules. The NCAA is also investigating the possibility that Stalions appeared on Central Michigan's sideline in Chippewas gear for a game against Michigan State.

sports,Nick Brinkerhoff,2023-09-26T21:53:00+00:00,"For Detroit, it's all about courage. For a team that was once down and out, much like their city, they are now once again on the rise. The Lions are supposed to be the kings of the jungle and hope to become the NFL's version in 2023. In terms of the food chain, a basic concept taught in science classes across the country, lions are the hunter rather than the hunted, but it's been the other way around for far too long, as 31 other teams have feasted on a once proud franchise.

Their motors have been restored and the team has been rebuilt with an attitude and moxie that would make even the most ""football guy"" of ""football guys"" blush. It's a combination of quiet confidence and a downright arrogant confidence that draws people in to root for -- or against -- an underdog.

While the Packers have packed up the Lions for years, that all began to change in 2022. Aaron Rodgers is no longer in Green Bay, and a new love interest is now under center, Jordan Love. It was these Lions that ended the Rodgers era and swept Green Bay last season. Now they meet again in prime time on one of the league's most hallowed grounds in a battle for NFC North supremacy. The tundra won't be frozen at Lambeau Field at this point in the season, but the game sure is important, and for a game like this, there's no way we could pass up the chance to win some cash with our FanDuel single-game DFS lineup.

Lions-Packers FanDuel Picks Week 4: NFL DFS lineup for GPP tournaments

Lions-Packers TNF, $60,000 budget

MVP (1.5x points) QB Jared Goff, Lions ($15,500). The Lions might not be the Super Bowl contenders we thought they could be, but that doesn't mean we aren't in for a treat on Thursday night at Lambeau Field. Detroit is finding its footing in 2023 and should be able to have some success against the Packers. On the surface, Green Bay's pass defense is playing around league average, allowing 207.3 passing yards per game. That slots them in at No. 18, while Pro Football Focus grades them the No. 8 team in coverage with an 81.5. Let's look beneath the surface a little more. The Packers' first three games have come against the No. 15, 29, and 31 ranked teams in passing yards per game, or the No. 21, 29, and 32 passing offenses as graded by PFF. The Lions love to throw and have a quarterback that rarely turns it over. Goff should be in position for a solid night with his arm, lighting it up through the air against a defense that might be without their star corner, Jaire Alexander (back), again in Week 4.

FLEX QB Jordan Love, Packers ($16,000). From one quarterback to another, we like this game to feature a lot of points. It's something that doesn't happen often on ""Thursday Night Football,"" but that should change this week. The Lions seem incapable of playing in low-scoring, grind-it-out games, so there will be chances for Love to get the Packers on the scoreboard often. He has seven passing touchdowns through the first three weeks and faces a bottom-10 passing defense, per PFF. Love will enjoy a date with Detroit's banged-up secondary that is just beginning life without C.J. Gardner-Johnson (pec).

FLEX WR Romeo Doubs ($10,500). Christian Watson appears primed for a return on Thursday night, but does it really matter? With him being held out for multiple weeks with a hamstring injury, we question the type of workload that the former North Dakota State standout is in line for. As a result, we look to Doubs. The second-year receiver is tied for the team lead in targets and has the most touchdowns with three. Along with Jayden Reed, Doubs has been a favorite of Love's in the red zone, as the duo has combined for 12-of-16 targets to receivers. As Watson eases his way back in, it's not like Doubs will fall off a cliff in terms of production. He remains relevant with that type of connection forming.

FLEX TE Sam LaPorta, Lions ($10,000). Rookie tight ends aren't typically fantasy-relevant right away, but that's where LaPorta finds himself, becoming a favorite target of Goff. He's been on an upward trajectory, starting with five targets in Week 1, six in Week 2, and 11 in Week 3. He's totaled 39, 63, and 84 yards, respectively, in those games, scoring a touchdown in the most recent contest. The Packers are a middle-of-the-road group against tight ends, but they still haven't faced one in a passing offense that lives up to LaPorta's level. On a short week with some banged-up players on offense, LaPorta should be a heavily involved security blanket.

FLEX TE, Luke Musgrave ($8,000). Much like with the quarterbacks, we also like the other tight end in this game. Musgrave is coming off his best game of the season, hauling in six catches for 49 yards, and he gets a matchup against the second-worst defense against tight ends. According to FantasyPros, the Lions are giving up 14.8 fantasy points per game to the position, leaving Musgrave in a great spot to deliver. If Watson does return on Thursday, it could help the rookie, as Detroit's defense will have to focus their attention elsewhere.

sports,Suzanne Wrack at Hampden Park,2023-12-05T21:56:19+00:00,"An anxious wait, then complete heartbreak. No one could question the effort, the heart or the drive of Sarina Wiegman’s Lionesses in this game, but scoring six goals against Scotland was not enough to close the goal difference gap on the Netherlands, because the Dutch scored a fourth against Belgium deep in added time to secure top spot and progress from their Nations League group ahead of England.

It was an extraordinary mountain and a Lauren James masterclass and gut-busting display from Lucy Bronze were not enough to lift them to the summit. The damage had been done in the preceding games, two poor goals conceded against the Dutch at Wembley, a 3-2 defeat in Belgium in October and a 2-1 loss to the Netherlands in September, will be full of regrets. However, there will be what‑ifs either way, the first goal conceded in Utrecht appearing offside in the buildup.

It meant a back and forth of goals scored by England against Scotland and the Netherlands in their win over Belgium was necessary in the final round of fixtures. A showdown.

There will be questions about Scotland’s efforts, a defensive collapse at Hampden Park almost helping England towards earning a place for Team GB at the Paris Olympics, but that would be unfair. The gulf in class between the European champions, ranked fourth in the world, and their neighbours to the north, ranked 23rd, is clear and the manager, Pedro Martínez Losa, has been unconvincing in charge.

There were two changes to the England side that came from two goals down to earn Friday’s late 3-2 win against the Netherlands that had kept hopes of progression alive. Beth Mead was returned to the starting lineup for the first time since suffering an anterior cruciate ligament injury just over a year ago, having proved her worth coming off the bench at half-time against the Dutch to insert some directness into England’s play, and Esme Morgan replaced Jess Carter.

Martínez Losa swapped four players from the side that earned a 1-1 draw with Belgium on Friday, with Lee Alexander notably replacing the former England international Sandy MacIver in goal.

Wiegman had urged her players to “go wild from the first minute” against Scotland, cautioning “but you don’t want to get erratic” and England came out of the blocks searching for an early goal that would assert their authority on the tie. If there was any doubt about Scotland’s intentions against England, with Bronze calling accusations that Scotland players might feel conflicted with the possibility of Olympic qualification on the line for them as much as for England “the rudest thing I’ve ever heard” and Scotland’s captain, Rachel Corsie, calling it “disrespectful” and “outrageous” those were put to bed, temporarily at least, in the opening three minutes, with Bronze clattered into late twice as Scotland looked to make an early impression.

If England had played well for the opening 10 minutes against the Dutch only to be sucker-punched on the counter in the 12th minute, against Scotland there was no risk of that. Instead, the visiting team took the lead to swing the pressure on to the Dutch, Mead’s corner sent in by an unmarked Greenwood.

Moments later Lisa Evans was down in the box under pressure from Bronze but appeals for a penalty were waved away with the right-back having not caught the forwards legs.

That rare foray forward was urged on by a vocal Scotland crowd, in which interesting conversations could be heard. After Lauren Hemp raced free on the right a hopeful “Come on Lauren” was met with a thick, cheery Scottish “Shut up!” behind the press box.

If it was friendly in the stands it was far less so on the pitch. England went close to a second, with the Dutch having taken the lead against Belgium, when James weaved into the box before delivering to Hemp at the far post who lashed her effort off the base of a post from close range.

Eight minutes later they doubled their lead. Mead’s corner was cleared and sent back in by the Arsenal forward only to be cleared again. But while England players appealed for handball, James sent the ball goalward and it took a heavy deflection that wrongfooted Alexander and flew in.

It wasn’t pretty, but England were clawing away at the goal difference gap. A minute later James delivered in more characteristic style, curling a wonderful effort into the top corner from the edge of the area.

In added time at the end of the half, James turned provider of the goal that put England top of the group once more, sweeping a cross to Mead at the far post for the forward to bring down and fire past a helpless Alexander.

The goal that gave England a cushion came shortly after the restart, Georgia Stanway beating Corsie to the byline before sending the ball into the middle for Fran Kirby to turn in from close range. The breathing room didn’t last long, though, with the Netherlands scoring once more.

There was almost disaster for England when Earps failed to collect from the feet of Kirsty Hanson, but the Scotland forward sent her effort wide of the empty net with the angle closing.

An added-time save of a header from the substitute Martha Thomas at full stretch by Mary Earps kept England in it. The Netherlands having scored in the 91st minute, Bronze’s powering header meant England were back in for two minutes, until they were out, the Dutch scoring in the 95th minute to crush the Lionesses while they stood in a huddle waiting for news of the other game’s result, the pain sweeping across their faces as it came through.",England thrash Scotland but cannot avoid Team GB Olympic heartbreak,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/dec/05/womens-nations-league-scotland-england-match-report,The Guardian

There is no denying how the new media rights deal has stunned the NASCAR community. With many still trying to digest it, the deal has undoubtedly given rise to divided opinions. While the figure of $7.7 billion sounds lucrative, there seems to be more to it than what meets the eye.

America’s Favorite Video Today

It is public knowledge that NASCAR officials invested plenty of time in negotiating the media rights deal. To secure an average annual revenue of $1.1 billion is something, especially when the sport is supposedly on the wane. However, it looks like the sanctioning body has made it count when it mattered the most.

Is the new media rights deal a game-changer for NASCAR?

ADVERTISEMENT Article continues below this ad

Just a couple of days back, NASCAR finalized a $7.7 billion deal with Fox Sports, NBC, Amazon, and Warner Bros. Discovery. With such a lucrative deal securing seven years of revenue, surely it seems like a lot of money. But is that really the case?

NASCAR secured almost a 40% increase over their current media rights deal yet there’s something that doesn’t fit perfectly. Sports Business Journal journalist Adam Stern recently cleared a few things out when he attended the Dirty Mo Live podcast. With the Cup Series already facing a 5% drop in viewership this year, Stern discussed how the new deal could impact the ratings.

At first, the renowned journalist explained how the sanctioning body would have loved to stay with Fox Sports and NBC. However, given that it would have most likely resulted in less money, NASCAR opted to explore other options. Stern then pointed out how the media rights revenue plays a key role in sports as he used the MLS as an example.

He said, “You look at MLS. MLS takes a big deal with Apple, almost all of their games behind the Apple TV’s paywall. That was the money they could get and they had to deliver for their industry. Their industry is expected to be a growing business and one of the most sporting ways to be a growing business in sports is to have growing media rights revenue.”

While he explained that it was a similar case with NASCAR, he added one more angle because of which this deal possibly materialized. It is no secret that the cable universe has been declining. As Stern discussed, every quarter, there is a drop in a couple of percentages of subscribers, which is very concerning.

This is one of the reasons why NASCAR did not want to gamble solely on cable users. With Amazon Prime, they had the leisure to explore the streaming arena and possibly get a glimpse of how it could look in the future. However, along with that, there was a major reason behind the deal.

As Stern said, “So partially, they [NASCAR] did it to spread their eggs in multiple baskets but also part out of it was to get more money and to make sure they get more money in the industry at the time when their teams are saying we need more money, we are not profitable currently.”

The SBJ journalist then explained that NASCAR was more or less left with no choice when it came to this deal. He said, “NASCAR is in a tough situation because they had to deliver more money as well and clearly if they went this route, that’s a good indication that’s because they had to go this route to deliver more money for the industry.”

While NASCAR secured an impressive deal, there could be downsides to it and Stern explained it beautifully.

Adam Stern points out a key potential drawback with NASCAR’s new media rights deal

Safe to say, NASCAR has been struggling to keep their teams happy in terms of profitability. Since the introduction of the Next Gen cars, it has only become more difficult for the Cup Series teams and teams in other competitions. While they have taken a commercial hit, they have piled up pressure on NASCAR to help out in this case.

In addition to that, Sports Business Journalist Adam Stern detailed one important issue with the new media rights deal. Speaking on the same podcast, he said, “When you look at the deal with Warner Bros. Discovery, those races are going to be simulcast not just on MAX streaming but also on TNT and TNT is cable, not a free-to-air channel.”

Stern continued explaining how it can come back to haunt. He said, “You have that on the cable subscription. So, the number of races that are going down that have been on the network, that’s what teams are concerned about because the ratings will probably be lower.”

With not every fan having access to all platforms, it is a tricky situation both for the fans and NASCAR. However, the sanctioning body has gone ahead and made its move with the new media rights deal. Now, it remains to be seen how the execution part works out. For now, it looks like NASCAR has secured itself well by bringing more money to the table.

sports,Sudeep Sinha,2023-10-18T21:27:46+00:00,"Crossover boxing matches are all the rage these days. Until a few days ago, the phenomenon was limited to influencers and MMA stars. But after a recent quarrel on X (formerly Twitter) between Conor McGregor and Canelo Alvarez, a potential crossover boxing match has the boxing world buzzing with excitement. If the fight were to turn into a reality, it could help ‘Cinnamon’ get closer to his former rival Floyd Mayweather in terms of net worth.

America’s Favorite Video Today

The talks of Conor McGregor vs. Floyd Mayweather began with a tweet that launched a fiery exchange of words between these two mammoths of combat sports. The brash and confident ‘Notorious’ McGregor turned to X, praising Mayweather’s 2013 performance against Canelo. But he also boasted about landing more punches on ‘Money’ Mayweather than the Mexican superstar. Canelo quickly retorted, asserting he would need only one hand to make quick work of McGregor. Later, the banter further escalated, bringing a potential fight in the picture.

Canelo Alvarez’s earnings and Floyd Mayweather’s influence

Canelo Alvarez reached his career high by becoming the first boxer to become the undisputed champion at super-middleweight by holding onto the WBA Super, WBC, and Ring Magazine super middleweight titles since 2020, and the IBF nd WBO titles since 2021. Meanwhile, his pockets became deeper and deeper, to the point that Canelo boasts a $180 million net worth in 2023. The most significant addition to his bank balance came when he signed a lucrative $365 million deal with DAZN and Golden Boy Promotions.

Furthermore, Canelo and McGregor’s careers are intertwined with the legendary Floyd Mayweather. ‘Money’ faced both fighters at one point or the other, leaving each with a boxing lesson. When Mayweather defeated Canelo, it pushed him to hone his skills while starting a lifelong rivalry. On the other hand, McGregor made his boxing debut against Mayweather, losing the fight but leaving with a fat stack.

Implications of a fight between Canelo Alvarez and Conor McGregor

The excitement and allure of two mammoths of combat sports getting in the ring to pummel each other to the brink of their endurance is undeniable. Not to mention, the fight will leave either party significantly wealthier than before. A potential clash between Saul Canelo Alvarez and the ‘Notorious’ Conor McGregor would not just be a dream come true for fans everywhere. It would also be a money magnet that would funnel income from a variety of channels.

A few of those lucrative channels of income would be revenue from pay-per-view sales, live gate revenue, merchandise sales from either party and various promotional events from the fight. What’s more, if anyone wondered if people would want to watch the fight. The attention it has gathered in the small span of their X (Twitter) feud should be evidence enough. Not to mention, both fighters command a massive fan base, counted in millions across the globe.

Canelo Alvarez and McGregor’s history of massive purses

If Canelo’s PPV pull was ever in question, his history of fight purses should convince everyone. Stepping back in time, Canelo’s fight with Mayweather collected 2.2 million pay-per-view buys. His 2017 bout against Julio César Chávez Jr. collected 1 million PPV buys. Canelo’s first battle with Gennady Golovkin gathered 1.3 million PPV sales. In his most recent battle against Jermell Charlo, the fight collected 700K PPV sales. These were just to name a few; over the years, Canelo has fought in increasingly profitable bouts.

On the other hand, Conor McGregor has created his own history in MMA as well as boxing. First of all, McGregor’s fight against Mayweather generated 4.3 million pay-per-view buys. His second fight against Dustin Poirier collected 1.6 million buys. The infamous fight against Khabib Nurmagomedov saw 2.4 million PPV sales. And lastly, his second fight against Nate Diaz collected 1.65 million PPV buys. If these numbers are any evidence, a Canelo vs. McGregor clash would break all their previous records by a mile.

A substantial step toward Mayweather’s net worth/Billionaire status

It’s no secret that Floyd Mayweather is the richest boxer in the world. The legendary undefeated boxer boasts a staggering net worth of $450 million. It makes the retired boxer the richest personality in boxing to ever exist. Despite retiring from the sport, he occasionally fights in exhibition matches, generating millions each time. In addition, Floyd has made over a billion dollars in the span of his career.

However, despite Floyd’s massive net worth, Canelo has inched closer to Floyd’s billionaire status over the years. If Canelo vs. McGregor ever manages to materialize, it could help Canelo take a significant leap to Mayweather’s net worth. The financial windfall from such a humongous clash would be substantial, driving him closer to Mayweather’s level of wealth. If Canelo’s past earnings are any evidence, this fight will be bigger than ever before. Canelo’s biggest fight to date is $45 million from the third encounter with Golovkin. So, a fight with McGregor could earn him anywhere from $55 to $60 million, adding to his $180 million. Meaning his total net worth would jump up to $240 million.

While matching Floyd’s net worth is no easy feat, if anyone can do it – it’s Canelo Alvarez. However, only time will tell if the fight can ever materialize. In case it does, it will be a spectacle the whole world would come together to witness. Do you think McGregor vs. Canelo can happen? Who would win the fight?

sports,Nick Musial,2023-12-07T22:11:00+00:00,"As fantasy football owners gear up for the last week of the fantasy regular season (in most leagues), our Week 14 fantasy WR PPR rankings are loaded top to bottom with just two teams on bye. Rolling out a strong receiving corps in a potential must-win week is essential, and we're here to shore up your start 'em, sit 'em concerns.

The highlight of our rankings is the long-awaited return of Justin Jefferson, who is (finally) set to suit up for the first time since Week 5. It's easy to forget, but in Jefferson's four full games this year, he averaged just over eight receptions and 135.8 yards per game while scoring three total touchdowns. Few receivers can dominate as he can, so we're happy to welcome him back.

Of course, Jefferson's return only helps one owner in each league, so let's break down the rest of the WR rankings to help you finish your season with a win.

Which WRs are on bye in Week 14?

The final set of bye weeks sees only the Commanders and Cardinals idle, resulting in the losses of Terry McLaurin, Marquise Brown, Jahan Dotson, Curtis Samuel, Rondale Moore, and Greg Dortch.

WEEK 14 PPR RANKINGS:

QBs | RBs | TEs | D/STs | Kickers

Even worse, Washington and Arizona sit as two of the weakest pass defenses in the league, so fantasy owners won't be able to count on big stats from their receivers going against the Commanders and Cardinals.

WEEK 14 STANDARD RANKINGS:

QBs | RBs | WRs | TEs | D/STs | Kickers

Who are the best fantasy WRs in Week 14?

The league's leading receiver, Tyreek Hill (vs. Titans in Week 14), stands as the unquestioned WR1 for Week 14 after torching the Commanders to the tune of five catches, 157 yards, and two TDs. CeeDee Lamb (vs. Eagles) and the Cowboys look to avenge their road loss to the Eagles in Week 9, as Dallas' WR1 routinely has double-digit reception potential.

Amon-Ra St. Brown (@ Bears) was relatively quiet this past week, but he's likely to rebound against a Bears defense that he totaled nine catches for 95 yards against in Week 11. A.J. Brown (@ Cowboys) reached the century mark for the first time in four games in Week 13, and another high-usage day looks to be in store for a potential shootout.

Keenan Allen (vs. Broncos) caught just five-of-nine targets last week, but as L.A.'s only reliable receiving option, a get-right game feels likely this week. Justin Jefferson (@ Raiders) is set to suit up for the first time since Week 5, and as we alluded to earlier, he's a must-start whenever he's active.

Stefon Diggs (@ Chiefs) hasn't totaled 100-plus receiving yards in any of his past six games, but he has every chance to get back on track against a Chiefs coverage unit that showed some leaks in Sunday's loss to the Packers.

WEEK 14 FANTASY ADVICE:

Sleepers | Busts | Projections | Start-sit

Who are the best fantasy WR sleepers, waiver pickups in Week 14?

Elijah Moore (vs. Jaguars), Noah Brown (@ Jets), Odell Beckham Jr. (vs. Rams), Jonathan Mingo (@ Saints), and Xavier Gipson (vs. Texans) are our preferred waiver-wire pickups in PPR formats for Week 14.

Moore (vs. Jaguars) just saw 12 targets from Joe Flacco and is in line for another high-usage day with Amari Cooper (concussion) potentially sidelined. Brown (@ Jets) should also see a steady target share after Tank Dell's (leg) season-ending injury.

Beckham Jr. (vs. Rams) is also likely to see increased usage with Mark Andrews (leg, ankle) done for the regular season. Mingo (@ Saints) has seen six-plus targets in his past four games, as his rapport with Bryce Young is strengthening by the week. Gipson led the Jets in receiving this past week (five receptions, 77 yards), and with New York routinely playing from behind, similar stat lines could be in the works.

WEEK 14 DFS:

DK lineup | FD lineup | Best values | Best stacks

Who are the biggest potential WR busts in Week 14?

It's tough to trust Calvin Ridley (@ Browns), Drake London (vs. Buccaneers), Jordan Addison (@ Raiders), and Jayden Reed (@ Giants) this week. Although Ridley has produced of late, a brutal matchup against a Browns coverage unit that entered Week 13 allowing the second-fewest fantasy points per game (FPPG) to WRs raises a red flag, and it's only compounded by the loss of Trevor Lawrence (ankle). London's week-to-week output is way too unpredictable, and with the fantasy season on the line for some of you, there's no reason to roll London out.

Addison is likely to take a step back with Jefferson back in the fold, while the Packers' receiving situation is too dispersed to put faith into Reed in PPR formats, though he might get a boost with Christian Watson (hamstring) banged up.

What are the biggest WR injuries in Week 14?

In Week 13, Demario Douglas (concussion) and Rashid Shaheed (thigh) missed game action, and Tank Dell (leg), Amari Cooper (concussion), Christian Watson (hamstring), and Marquise Brown (heel) exited early from their respective games.

UPDATE: Christian Kirk suffered a groin injury on Monday night, and he figures to be more doubtful than questionable for this week's game against Cleveland. If he's out, Zay Jones and Tim Jones will see more targets, but with Trevor Lawrence (ankle) also hurt, it's tough to count on either.

UPDATE: Douglas (concussion) has been ruled OUT for Week 14.

As usual, we'll update these WR PPR rankings throughout the week, so check back for the latest player movement and analysis.

sports,Sloan Piva,2023-12-07T22:07:00+00:00,"It's make-or-break time in fantasy land. Only one week stands between now and the fantasy football playoffs, so every decision we make could be the difference between an optimal finish and a womp-womp ending. Our Week 14 fantasy RB rankings for standard leagues will help steer your fantasy ship to the smoothest possible sailing, guiding you to the running back studs, sleepers, busts, and injuries of note going into the most important week of the regular season.

The rollercoaster that the 2023 season has been rolled on through Week 13, with yet another fresh batch of injuries. Luckily for us, we have strong stomachs (and we're not above taking offers from potential sponsors, TUMS and Kaopectate!). So, like always, we will navigate through the injuries to provide you with the most up-to-date information and analysis.

Let's get to our Week 14 RB rankings and hopefully help you close out the regular season in style. Good luck, check back often, and enjoy the remainder of the first week of December!

Which RBs are on bye in Week 14?

After a six-team byepocalypse in Week 13, only the Cardinals and Commanders will be off this coming weekend. That takes lead backs Brian Robinson Jr. and James Conner off the table, plus Antonio Gibson for those in deep leagues.

WEEK 14 STANDARD RANKINGS:

QBs | WRs | TEs | D/STs | Kickers

One thing that stinks for fantasy is that both Washington and Arizona have been defensive turnstiles. Many of the stud running backs have tough matchups in Week 14, but it's only right that many of the elite backs must beat the best defenses to lift fantasy squads to the big dance.

WEEK 14 PPR RANKINGS:

QBs | RBs | WRs | TEs | D/STs | Kickers

Who are the best fantasy RBs in Week 14?

Christian McCaffrey (vs. Seahawks in Week 14) retains his spot at No. 1, especially considering he's playing at home against a Seattle team he just roughed up for 139 yards and two TDs on Thanksgiving. We're also sticking with Austin Ekeler (vs. Broncos) even though he has managed just 2.99 yards per carry since returning from injury just eight games ago. If Denver's abysmal run D doesn't cure what ails him, Ek's getting demoted for the fantasy playoffs.

Travis Etienne Jr. (@ Browns) draws a tough matchup on paper, but the Rams' Kyren Williams (@ Ravens) might beg to differ. Williams put 112 total yards and a TD on Cleveland in Week 13, and with Etienne's usage rate and the Jags hitting their stride offensively as of late, we're confident in the third-year back's ranking at No. 3.

We have two sets of teammates in our top 10 this week: Detroit's David Montgomery and Jahmyr Gibbs (@ Bears) and Miami's Raheem Mostert and De'Von Achane (vs. Titans). Both duos have such solid workloads in high-flying, run-first offenses — and such juicy matchups — that we can't imagine any of these studs finishing outside the elite eight. DMont and Gibbs combined for 193 yards and two TDs when they faced Chicago in Week 11. Tennessee just surrendered 31 points to Indy, so we know Miami will be dominating the time of possession and running early and often against Will Levis and company.

Jets fans will be hoping for some Breece Lightning from stud second-year back Breece Hall (vs. Texans), and we think they will be rewarded for their patience. Houston has surrendered 111.8 scrimmage yards per game to RBs this season, and DeMeco Ryans' unit has also allowed 14 total rushing TDs on the year. We like Hall's upside even more than we like stud dual-purpose backs Alvin Kamara (vs. Panthers) and Saquon Barkley (vs. Packers), but just barely. Kamara and Barkley both have strong matchups, with Carolina and Green Bay both sitting in the bottom 10 in the NFL in standard fantasy points allowed to RBs.

WEEK 14 FANTASY ADVICE:

Sleepers | Busts | Projections | Start-sit

Who are the best fantasy RB sleepers, waiver pickups in Week 14?

We'll talk more about Derrick Henry (concussion) in the injury section, but we can say with confidence here and now that Tyjae Spears (@ Dolphins) should be the hottest waiver-wire pickup of Week 14. Tennessee is a run-first offense and King Henry might be sidelined with a head injury, so Spears could very well pick up where he left off against Indy last weekend. The young back averaged 4.7 yards per carry (just shy of his 5.1 YPC entering the week) en route to 88 yards.

Another backup getting a boost this week is the Patriots' Ezekiel Elliott (@ Steelers), who will assume lead-back duties after Rhamondre Stevenson went down with a pretty bad ankle injury in Week 13. Zeke might put in a vintage performance considering James Conner just went back to Pittsburgh and hung 105 yards and two TDs on his old squad.

Could this be the weekend that Keaton Mitchell (vs. Rams) gets back into RB2 range for the Ravens? Los Angeles might find itself spying Lamar Jackson and Gus Edwards so often that the speedy rookie busts a couple of big runs. Mitchell has racked up 330 yards and two TDs since he broke out four games ago, but the majority of that damage (134 yards and a TD) came in the initial breakout against Seattle. He has still yet to see 12 touches in a game, something we can't imagine will be the case by the end of the regular season.

We also think Roschon Johnson (vs. Lions) could have a chance to take over lead-back duties in Chicago, as both Khalil Herbert and D'Onta Foreman have battled injuries and inconsistent touches this season. It's a tough matchup, so temper your expectations, but there's some high-floor flex appeal considering Alvin Kamara and Taysom Hill averaged 5.2 yards per touch and found the end zone three times via the ground against Detroit last week.

WEEK 14 DFS:

DK lineup | FD lineup | Best values | Best stacks

Who are the biggest potential RB busts in Week 14?

We're a tad worried about Buffalo second-year back James Cook (@ Chiefs), as Kansas City's front-seven tends to be stout against speedsters but below-average against power backs. You probably aren't in a position to bench Cook, but don't expect massive numbers from the guy who averaged just 2.7 yards per carry against the Eagles his last time out.

Zach Charbonnet (@ 49ers) faces a tough matchup and has a bruise on his knee, so we don't expect very fruitful results from the rookie if he starts in Santa Clara this weekend. We also don't love Jerome Ford or Kareem Hunt (vs. Jaguars), as Jacksonville entered Week 12 allowing just 12.3 standard fantasy points per game to RBs (third lowest in the NFL).

We say it almost every week, but the song remains the same: don't start Carolina backs Chuba Hubbard or Miles Sanders (@ Saints). It's even worse than usual this week, as New Orleans has a pretty hard-hitting front-seven and the Bayou is no place for below-average offenses.

What are the biggest RB injuries in Week 14?

Two-time rushing champ Derrick Henry (head) suffered a huge blow to the head and neck area in Tennessee's Week 13 loss to the Colts, so don't be surprised if the king gives up his throne to Tyjae Spears this week. He immediately left the game and proceeded to the locker room following the hit, and it was confirmed that he would not return with a head injury. It wouldn't make much sense for a four-win team to rush back its franchise player.

Patriots dual-purpose back Rhamondre Stevenson (ankle) suffered an injury on a nasty hip-drop tackle in New England's Week 13 loss to the Chargers. Bill Belichick and company already noted that 'Mondre would miss multiple weeks, so we're bumping Ezekiel Elliott way up against the Steelers.

D'Andre Swift took a hard hit and exited Philadelphia's game late against the 49ers, but it's tough to know if he's actually hurt or was just kept out because of the lopsided score. If Swift can't go in Week 14 against Dallas, Kenneth Gainwell and Boston Scott will split touches, with Gainwell likely garnering flex value.

Jonathan Taylor underwent thumb surgery last week and is expected to miss a few weeks. Tough for Taylor owners to ride the home stretch of the regular season without JT, but at least they could get him back for the end of the fantasy playoffs. The injury highlights the importance of handcuffs, as Zack Moss has put up multiple top-10 performances with and without Taylor this season.

Seattle's Kenneth Walker III (oblique) missed Week 12 and 13, and we're not confident in his ability to suit up against the hard-hitting 49ers coming off a big win in Philly. Backup Zach Charbonnet exited early because of a knee injury against the Cowboys, putting his status in doubt, too. If both are out, DeeJay Dallas would start and lead the backfield in touches.

Green Bay's Aaron Jones has a sprained MCL, and sources have revealed that the Packers continue to consider him week-to-week. He only logged four carries before sustaining the injury in Week 11, then he sat for the Packers' Thanksgiving Day tilt with the Lions and their Sunday Night Football win over Kansas City. Why rush him back if Green Bay is already winning games?

D'Onta Foreman (ankle) missed Chicago's game before the bye, and his status remains unclear heading into Week 14. If he's healthy, he'll likely start in Chicago's backfield, but it's anyone's guess how carries will be divvied up after Roschon Johnson surprisingly led the way in Week 12.

We'll be updating these standard RB rankings all week, so check back for the latest player movement.

sports,Kyle Irving,2023-10-01T23:47:00+00:00,"Just when you thought the Chiefs were going to march into MetLife Stadium and cruise to a victory, the Jets threw a vicious counterpunch to make for an interesting ""Sunday Night Football"" game.

Trailing by as much as 17 points, New York was able to tie the game at 20 heading into the fourth quarter. The Chiefs took the lead on a field goal early in the final frame and a crucial turnover from Jets QB Zach Wilson eventually decided the fate of the game as Kansas City did not give the ball back to earn the win, 23-20.

Chiefs star QB Patrick Mahomes did not have his best game — throwing for just 200 yards and one touchdown to two interceptions — but he made clutch plays in the game's biggest moments to come away with a victory. Wilson had one of his best games as a pro, throwing for 245 yards and two touchdowns.

Despite the commotion surrounding Taylor Swift's attendance, Travis Kelce had a relatively quiet game with six receptions for 60 yards. Instead, the Chiefs offense was powered by RB Isiah Pacheco who rushed for 115 yards and a touchdown.

If you missed any action from a back-and-forth ""Sunday Night Football"" game, The Sporting News had you covered with live updates, highlights and more.

Chiefs 17, Jets 0

8:54 p.m.: TOUCHDOWN! Patrick Mahomes finds TE Noah Gray wide open for a 34-yard TD to give the Chiefs a 17-0 lead. With too much attention on star TE Travis Kelce, Gray was able to escape free for his first touchdown of the season.

8:47 p.m.: Jets RB Breece Hall ran for an 11-yard first down on the first play of the drive, but that was all New York's offense could put together.

Chiefs 10, Jets 0

8:40 p.m.: TOUCHDOWN! Isiah Pacheco hardly even gets touched on a 48-yard carry for the first touchdown of the game. Chiefs' offensive lineman Trey Smith threw an incredible block as a pulling guard, clearing a runway for Pacheco to waltz into the end zone.

sports,Martin Derbyshire,2023-11-06T21:23:22+00:00,"Prop bets are easy to understand and add a twist to most sporting events as you can bet on in-game events not tied to the outcome.

Prop bets are popular throughout the year and are posted for every major sport, but the pinnacle for prop betting is the Super Bowl. It’s the most popular day of the year for prop bets, which range from the typical to the exotic.

But you don’t have to wait for the Super Bowl to get involved in prop betting. See below for more on props, including the pros, cons, and prop bet examples from all the major sports.

What is a prop bet?

A prop bet is a “side bet” with a sportsbook on a specific event or statistical accomplishment within the game. These rarely have anything to do with the outcome of a game itself.

For example, you might bet on:

LeBron James scoring over 20 points in a single game

Dallas Cowboys gaining over 300 receiving yards in a game

Pros and cons of prop bets

Every bet has positives and negatives, and prop bets are no different.

Pros

The lines don’t usually move as fast as other bet types: Prop bet odds are developed based on game lines and totals at sportsbooks, but prop bet lines tend to adjust more slowly. Let’s say you’re keeping an eye on the New York Jets vs. the Buffalo Bills, and you see the total shift due to an incoming winter storm. While many bettors will scramble to get their bet in on the ‘under’ before the lines move too much, it’s a good idea to scope out the prop bets for individual players. The main lines are shifting, but most of the best sports betting sites don’t have the personnel to keep tabs on every possible player, so you could find value in an ‘under’ on a quarterback’s passing yards because the lines haven’t caught up yet.

There’s greater variety: The three main bet types—moneylines, point spreads, and totals—are constant in every major sport, but they don’t offer a lot in the way of variety. Prop bets do. They can add interest to a game that may seem one-sided in the major markets. Larger sporting events, especially the Super Bowl, offer a massive variety of bets, ranging from the typical to the exotic and everything in between.

They can add interest to a game that may seem one-sided in the major markets. Larger sporting events, especially the Super Bowl, offer a massive variety of bets, ranging from the typical to the exotic and everything in between. They are usually very easy to understand: Prop bets tend to ask a question of the bettor. Will a specific player hit a home run? Will Team X have over/under 3.5 field goals in a game? Will Team Y give up a powerplay goal? Whatever the question, prop bets are fairly easy to understand for the newcomer.

Cons

Props are difficult to research: Prop bets are so specific you’d think it would be easier to research them than other bet types, but the reality is that sports are extremely volatile. You can never truly predict how an athlete or a team will perform. This makes it very hard to nail down smart prop bets. For example, you could bet on a certain player to score ‘over’ a point threshold, but you lose because that player had an off-night, even though they might have easily won that bet in other recent games.

Prop bets can tie up your bankroll: We wouldn’t recommend using prop bets as your main bet type when building your strategy. Use most of your budget on more stable bet types, such as moneylines, spreads, or totals. Focus only a small percentage of your bankroll on props.

Focus only a small percentage of your bankroll on props. Exotic props are a guessing game: When large events like the Super Bowl roll around, you’ll be inundated with exotic and entertaining prop bets. These are almost impossible to research, and pure guessing isn’t good for anyone’s bankroll or betting strategy.

Prop bet examples for major sports

Every major sport with odds at the best sports betting apps will have prop bets. Below, we give examples of prop bets you might find when betting on major American sports.

NBA prop bets

The NBA offers a wide range of prop bets. They vary from player to team bets and lean heavily on the statistical side of the game. Some NBA prop examples include:

How many points a player will score

Number of assists or three-pointers a player will have

Which player will score the first basket of a game

You can also bet on team props, such as whether a team will lead at the end of a certain quarter or an over/under bet on the total number of points the team will score in the game.

See more: NBA prop bets

NFL prop bets

The National Football League is the king of sports betting, and NFL betting sites have no qualms about showcasing every kind of possible bet type for it.

Bettors will find many prop bet opportunities, especially for the Super Bowl. During the regular season, one of the most popular prop bet options includes the “anytime touchdown scorer” bet, where you can wager on a player to score a TD at any point in the game. Other prop bets can be focused on the team or even both teams.

See more: Super Bowl prop bets

MLB prop bets

MLB betting sites are no exception when it comes to offering prop bets. Like the other sports, MLB has prop bets focused primarily on individual players and statistical achievements like home runs, RBI, and strikeouts.

You might bet on an over/under for strikeouts for a starting pitcher in a game or even the number of bases a hitter will reach.

NHL prop bets

NHL betting sites have all of the props you’d expect from one of the major North American sports leagues, such as player assists or a certain player scoring a goal in a contest.

You will also find bets for shots on goal, team goals in a game, and which team will score first.

MLS prop bets

The demand for Major League Soccer betting has increased as the sport's popularity continues growing nationwide. Prop bets are just one of the many bet types growing at sportsbooks to keep up with the demand.

As expected, these prop bets often focus on individual players and their accomplishments, such as scoring a goal or collecting an assist in a game. Soccer betting sites also have props such as how many cards the two teams playing will combine to draw or a team’s total number of corner kicks.

How to read prop bet odds

Prop bets at US sportsbooks use the same odds as other major bet types like moneylines, point spreads, and totals. These odds, known as American odds, use negative and positive numbers to show you how much money you stand to win.

Positive odds show how much you stand to win for every $100 you wager. Let's say you wager on a quarterback to have over 2.5 touchdowns in a game at +145 odds, and he throws three in the game. If you wagered $100, you would be paid $245, your initial wager of $100 returned to you, plus $145 in winnings.

Negative odds tell you how much you need to wager to win $100. For example, if you bet a player will score less than 15.5 points in a basketball game at -135 odds, you would need to bet $135 to win $100.

Remember that you don’t have to wager that high or that low. Your payout will be calculated proportionally to your wager size when you finalize your bet slip.

What is an exotic prop bet?

An exotic prop bet is a non-traditional prop bet that is not focused on scenarios during a game. Instead, they can be as out of the ordinary as the sportsbook wants.

In the US, the most exotic bets are available during the Super Bowl, which is the most prominent sports betting day of the year and offers up hundreds of prop bets to interested bettors.

These bets can range from the number of songs sung during the halftime show to the result of the coin toss to the color of the sports drink dumped on the winning coach at the end of the game.

For the most part, you won’t come across too many exotic prop bets when using US sportsbooks, as many are just not legal bets. However, the largest sporting events, such as the Super Bowl or March Madness, will find sportsbooks offering up a wider range of prop bets. That’s usually when you’ll find more exotic props.

Sportsbook rules for prop bets

Before placing any kind of bet, we highly recommend you read the sportsbook’s terms and conditions. There, you will find all the rules for the various bets you will make.

While most sportsbooks’ rules are similar, there are always small variations in how they handle certain situations that could impact your bets.

One rule that is typically used by most sportsbooks involves player props. If you bet on a player and they don’t play in the game, most sportsbooks void the bet and refund your wager. But if that player is involved in the game even for a single play, then the bet stands.

We recommend reading through the T&Cs before placing any wagers so you’re not caught by surprise if an unexpected event should happen.

Eagles vs. Seahawks MNF odds + picks to consider: Use our bonus codes and links for the best football betting promos

Here are odds for tonight’s Eagles vs. Seahawks Monday Night Football game.

The Eagles and Seahawks come into this Monday Night Football game on troubling losing streaks. The NFC matchup has important playoff implications, particularly for Philadelphia.

Philly’s two-game losing streak has dropped them to second place in the NFC East behind the Cowboys, who are also 10-3 but have the tiebreaker thanks to their slightly better divisional record.

For a good stretch of the season, the Eagles appeared unstoppable and have been a favorite to return to the Super Bowl. After a surprising loss to the Jets in Week 6 (their first of the season), Philadelphia went on a five-game winning streak, impressively taking down top teams like the Dolphins, Cowboys and Chiefs. Most of those games were gritty, close wins, but then the Eagles dropped back-to-back games in blowout fashion to the 49ers and Cowboys, raising alarm bells amongst the Philly fanbase.

The Eagles are looking to rebound against a Seahawks team that has been reeling even worse, losing four straight. Sitting four games behind the 49ers in the NFC West, despite a disappointing season, Seattle still has a shot at a wild card playoff spot. After tonight’s game, the Seahawks’ schedule eases up a bit, with winnable games against the Titans, Steelers and Cardinals. But they could really use a victory to give them some confidence going into the final stretch.

sports,Kyle Bonn,2023-10-04T22:12:56+00:00,"Lionel Messi's arrival at Inter Miami has brought with it a craze for fans to get a glimpse of one of the sport's most talented and legendary players of all time.

Along with that skyrocketing attention comes a leap in prices, and sadly the club seems to be passing that cost on to the supporters.

In 2024, Inter Miami will sport some of the world's most expensive tickets, rivaling the prices of Champions League giants such as Barcelona, Arsenal, and other massive clubs around Europe, while dwarfing other MLS ticket packages.

While Fox Sports reported the club has an extensive waiting list for 2024 season tickets, the massive increase in price could push out many of the team's most dedicated supporters who have been with the team since its inception in 2020, causing massive turnover in the fanbase.

A reminder that for most clubs, season-ticket packages include only home league matches, and while members usually get first access to purchase tickets for knockout competitions, those all come at an additional cost.

Inter Miami season tickets: Prices for 2024

The pricing structure for 2024 represents an enormous increase over the 2023 costs. The cheapest season ticket in 2023 was $485, but that will jump all the way to $884, which is an increase of 78.8%. There is a discount for fans who renew by October 7.

Meanwhile, a season ticket in the lower-level midfield club area, which includes upscale food and beverage options, cost $3,600 in 2023 but will now run $7,650 for the 2024 season, an increase of 113%, more than doubling year-over-year.

Inter Miami 2024 season ticket prices

Prices below courtesy of Inter Miami season ticketing release via the Miami Herald on September 28, 2023. Sections 2 through B are considered ""premium"" seating, while C through L are considered ""standard.""

Code Section Price 2 Mid Loge $45,900 3 North Loge $42,840 4 South Loge $42,840 5 Midfield Club $7,650 6 East Field Seats $13,005 A Northwest Prime $5,440 B Northwest Midfield $4,420 C West Sideline $2,720 D West Reserved $2,380 E East Midfield $2,635 F East Upper Midfield $2,125 G East Sideline $1,955 H East Reserved $1,360 I North Goaline $1,054 J South Goaline $1,020 K South Stand $867 L North Stand Reserved $884

Inter Miami season tickets among most expensive in world for 2024

With the Inter Miami season-ticket cost increasing by a huge margin over its own pricing model from 2023 to 2024, the club now boasts some of the most expensive seats in world football, also rivaling that of other major sports in the U.S.

The cheapest season ticket for Inter Miami in 2024 is $867, which works out to $51 per match across the 17 home games in the upcoming MLS season. Meanwhile, a seat in the West Reserved section, which puts a fan in the upper deck near the middle of the pitch, is now priced at a whopping $140 per match.

According to Telemundo, this makes Inter Miami one of the most expensive tickets in the entire world. The cheapest Barcelona season ticket, for example, can be had for $377 for the season. Even while their prices are muted thanks to the next few seasons being played outside the under-construction Camp Nou, they are still just 25% cheaper than tickets to Barcelona's famed home ground.

One of Europe's most expensive tickets can be found at Tottenham, thanks in part to the brand new state-of-the-art Tottenham Hotspur Stadium, and even then its cheapest ticket is around $974, while its most expensive package comes out to $2,498 for the year.

The most expensive premium packages at Inter Miami in 2024, which will run supporters over $45,000, dwarf any of the most luxurious tickets in the Premier League. The most expensive season ticket in the EPL can be found at Fulham, where the Craven Cottage luxury booths are valued at $3,620. Barcelona's most expensive season ticket is $1,826 for the full year.

The National Football League (NFL), the most popular sport in the United States by a massive margin, boasted an average ticket price of $112 in 2022, while the average NBA ticket price was $94 that year.

These prices also dwarf many other clubs in Major League Soccer. Orlando City SC, one of Inter Miami's chief in-state rivals, have their cheapest season ticket available for just $324 in 2024, over half the cost of any Inter Miami season ticket, while their most expensive premium ticket costs $2,898. Meanwhile, another nearby rival, Atlanta United, will feature its cheapest season ticket for $605 in 2024, or just $525 for founding members.

Inter Miami season-ticket glitch causes scare

Already, price increases have Inter Miami season ticket holders on edge, but a computer glitch saw supporters fed an even bigger scare.

Mike Ryan, a Miami local who regularly appears on the radio program The Dan LeBatard Show, posted on social media his shock when he received a 2024 renewal for $30,600 for his two seats, which in 2023 cost just $6,802. Ryan then posted a follow-up a few hours later that stated he was contacted by Inter Miami representatives who indicated that pricing was incorrect thanks to a computer glitch that sent supporters quotes for additional seats they did not actually have.

Still, Ryan's follow-up indicated that his error quote was doubled in price over the actual cost, which still leaves his seats increasing from around $6,800 to a whopping $15,300 for two seats, an increase of 125% year-on-year.",Inter Miami season tickets: Lionel Messi demand causes 2024 prices soar to most expensive in world,https://www.sportingnews.com/us/soccer/news/inter-miami-season-tickets-messi-2024-prices-expensive-world/94a7a0825eec97b57cc1df4a,Sporting News
sports,Ben Miller,2023-12-05T20:30:03+00:00,"Manchester United would love a repeat of last season's 4-1 home win over Chelsea when the Blues visit Old Trafford this Wednesday.

The pressure on United has grown again following their lacklustre 1-0 defeat at Newcastle on Saturday and another setback against a Chelsea side – who beat Brighton & Hove Albion 3-2 the following day – would worsen the misery around Old Trafford.

Two heavyweights of world football, United and Chelsea are two of only seven teams to have won the modern Premier League and are only behind Liverpool when it comes to English success with European trophies.

Chelsea's recent record against United is poor, but they have won the Premier League twice since United last did so in the 2012/13 season and could exploit the poor form of Ten Hag's side here.

The Sporting News looks at a rivalry that stretches back decades and has been sharply in focus over recent years.

MORE: Man United's incredible run of home cup draws

Man United vs Chelsea head-to-head record, all-time results

United have the edge in the historical head-to-head, helped by their run of seven wins and only one defeat in the first 12 meetings between the teams, from 1905 to 1913.

One of Chelsea's best runs in the fixture came after Roman Abramovich took over the club in 2004. From the start of the following season, United lost five and won one of the nine games between the teams.

The game has provided the FA Cup final on three occasions, Chelsea winning the most recent of those through Eden Hazard's penalty in 2018.

Hazard scored the only goal of the game to repeat the scoreline when Chelsea beat United in the final after extra time in 2007, avenging a 4-0 defeat to Sir Alex ferguson's side in 1994.

Arguably the most memorable game between the pair is the 2008 UEFA Champions League final, when United goalkeeper Edwin van der Sar saved Nicholas Anelka's penalty to give his side victory following a 1-1 draw after extra time.

Man United vs Chelsea recent results

Ahead of their visit to Old Trafford in December 2023, Chelsea’s most recent Premier League away win against Manchester United was a 1-0 win in May 2013.

At that point, they had won more Premier League games at Old Trafford (six) than any other side, but they proceeded to draw six and lose four of their next 10 trips to M16.

Manchester United are currently 11 Premier League games unbeaten against Chelsea since November 2017. However, the fact that seven of those matches ended all square has helped to make the game the most drawn fixture in Premier League history.

Some 19 of those draws have featured goals for both teams. A 1-1 draw in the fixture is the most common exact scoreline in Premier League history, occurring 14 times.

Do Man United vs Chelsea have a rivalry?

Although the matches between United and Chelsea have tended to be closely contested, they do not have as fierce a rivalry as the Red Devils do with the likes of Manchester City and Liverpool, or the west London club holds with neighbours such as Tottenham and Arsenal.

Abramovich's takeover gave Chelsea a new level of wealth that temporarily turned them into the dominant force in the English game, briefly supplanting United, who had won the title in eight of the previous 12 Premier League seasons.

Under the brash Jose Mourinho – an antagonist to his legendary United counterpart Sir Alex Ferguson – Chelsea embarrassed third-placed United in 2004/05, winning the trophy while finishing 18 points ahead of them and, at one point, forcing Ferguson's players to give them a guard of honour at Old Trafford because of the timing of their title win.

United closed the gap to finish eight points behind Chelsea in second the following season, then returned to the top in 2006/07, the deposed champions coming six points short of their total.

Two points separated the teams as United won the Premier League again in 2007/08, and there would be one more changing of the guard to come when Chelsea finished first above United in 2009/10 – only for United to finish top a year later.

That ultra-tight Champions League final encapsulated how close the rivalry had become in a competitive sense, and both teams have won the Premier League since then, leaving United on a record 20 titles and Chelsea on six.

Chelsea have won the Champions League and Europa League twice each, while United have won the former trophy three times and the latter once.

United's tally of 12 FA Cup triumphs is eight more than Chelsea have claimed, but both sets of supporters will be hoping their teams can become superpowers again after barren periods by their 21st-century standards.

The rise of mega-wealthy Manchester City to become arguably the best team in the world has not helped, and nor has Liverpool's resurgence under Jurgen Klopp. United finished well off the pace albeit in a respectable third at the end of 2022/23, a season in which Chelsea came 12th – their lowest final position for 29 years.","Man United vs Chelsea head to head record, all-time results between Premier League giants",https://www.sportingnews.com/us/soccer/news/man-united-vs-chelsea-head-head-record-all-time-results-between-premier-league-giants/b22c86de60fa22873714abc1,Sporting News
sports,Jonathan Liew at Wembley,2023-12-01T22:57:40+00:00,"They’ll always have Paris. Throughout this Nations League campaign this has been an England team fighting its own sense of entropy, still giving everything, still trying the same plans and processes in the hope that eventually something would click. And at 9.34pm on a briskly cold Wembley night, it finally did. Ella Toone’s injury-time goal earned England three points and kept their faintly glowing Olympic dream alive. But somehow it also did so much more.

It breathed life into a team and a cycle, and a moment that for so much of the evening had felt like it was drawing to its natural conclusion provided a rousing encore to a cast preparing for its final curtain. There will be new challenges and new frontiers to conquer soon enough, a fresh set of European Championship qualifiers in the spring, but for now this iteration of the Lionesses still has tricks up its sleeve, still has talent and creativity to burn, still has a fire that can scorch any team on the planet.

And as they rallied so spectacularly to salvage a match that looked cooked after 35 minutes, running on fumes and adrenaline, sustained by the sizzle of the Wembley crowd, the cold air on their skin and the flickering candle of qualification for Paris next summer, it was as if a kind of energy was surging within them.

An energy that we have not really glimpsed from them since they reassembled this autumn, barely a month on from the trauma of Sydney, still a little dazed and concussed.

Beth Mead came on for Chloe Kelly at half-time, Georgia Stanway moved further forward and made herself a menace in the penalty area, and the old buddies Toone and Alessia Russo teamed up off the bench. The Dutch retreated further and further into Wembley’s wide open spaces, giving Lauren James the time and territory to dictate. James had a hand in all three goals, and as Toone ghosted in at the far post to provide the final flourish, Wembley screeched out one last call to arms, one last push, one last effort.

For all this, it is probably worth pointing out that for large parts of the game England were not very good. And we were reminded that for all their creativity and verve going forward perhaps the biggest flaw in this side is a lack of presence in the two penalty areas, the physicality and the alpha energy to do the grunt work, to convert the crosses and to head them away.

Jess Carter had a poor game and was withdrawn for Esme Morgan after half-time, Alex Greenwood over-committed for the first Dutch goal and even the all-conquering Mary Earps plummeted to Earth with a poor first-half error.

But beyond personnel, a basic brittleness seems to have crept into this team, a sense of melting surfaces and cracks in the ice. Sarina Wiegman talks a lot about defending against counterattacks, because this is basically the key to the whole enterprise. Cut off the counter, and with England’s technical quality they can easily dominate. It is also the essential measure of how the team is functioning as a collective: the efficiency of the press, the closing of the angles, the command of space. Lineth Beerensteyn’s two goals were the sort England simply were not conceding four months ago.

So England passed the ball around a bit and gave it away a bit and essentially ran around trying to feel normal again, and on countless occasions Kelly or Hemp would win a first or second ball, look up and see a penalty area empty of white shirts. These are issues not so much of tactics but cohesion and energy: the timing of runs, the sharpness required not just to anticipate where the ball is going to be, but actually get there. You can still chase when you’re running on fumes, but to create: this needs an idea and a vision, the clarity of mind to see the picture before it has materialised.

And clarity is perhaps what this team has been lacking most of late: clarity of selection, clarity of formation, clarity of mission and motivation. How much prestige should we really attach to the Nations League, anyway? Is it primarily an Olympic qualification shootout or something worth winning in its own right? England ended up trying to answer these questions on the hoof, and somehow it was only when their options had finally clarified down to one – survival or oblivion – that they recovered their poise and verve.

This entire post-pandemic international cycle – a Euros, a World Cup, an Olympics and another Euros squeezed into three years – feels like a kind of sadism dressed up as a panorama of opportunity. There is a school of thought out there that a fallow summer might not have been the worst thing for this team: time to reflect and process, time to breathe, time to refresh.

Instead, they now travel to Glasgow on Tuesday for one last push. The minds are still frazzled. The bodies are screaming. But chaos and confusion has never felt quite so sweet.",England choose survival over oblivion and a chance of summer trip to France | Jonathan Liew,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/dec/01/england-choose-survival-over-oblivion-and-a-chance-of-summer-trip-to-france,The Guardian

Betting on team golf events, such as the Ryder Cup and the Presidents Cup, offers a thrilling twist to tournament viewing. Bettors can choose from various options: betting on the winning team, outcomes of individual matches, or prop bets such as which team scores highest in a round, who makes more birdies, or even the best-dressed team captain.

When placing bets on these events, evaluating each team's strengths and weaknesses is vital. Factors to consider include recent player form, their history on the event's course, and any potential impacts like injuries.

Sheppard lands on her back. ′ ‘Girls’ play hard too,” Harford said on X, the social media site formerly known as Twitter. This echoed Collingwood defender and Fox Footy commentator Ruby Schleicher’s thoughts at the time, who called it a “monster tackle” but believed it was “fair”. “I don’t see any dirtiness in that,” Schleicher said on Fox Footy. “It was pretty heavy on her head, wasn’t it? I look at that – I still see a fair tackle. There’s no doubt the match review [officer] will look at it because they have to I guess. The duty of care for the player.”

The decision a week comes after Adelaide premiership defender Najwa Allen was handed a three-ban suspension, the longest ban in AFLW history, for a high bump on Western Bulldog Kirsten McLeod. The Crows elected not to challenge the decision. ‘Horror week’: Bombers stunned by struggling, controversy-hit Eagles West Coast withstood a late-term surge from Essendon to narrowly claim their second win of the AFLW season.

Fresh off a controversy caused by comments their coach Michael Prior made following last week’s 70-point loss to Melbourne, the Eagles prevailed 3.5 (23) to 2.7 (19) in a slugfest at the appropriately named Windy Hill on Sunday.

That is what you get when you get fixturing like that.” He later backtracked on the criticism, but his comments did put added pressure and focus on his team this week.

Aisling McCarthy and Amy Franklin drew first blood for West Coast within the opening five minutes, while the hosts were kept goalless. The Bombers only added three behinds in the second term and the Eagles failed to score as the blustery conditions took their toll on the game. West Coast’s Kellie Gibson broke the goal drought with the only major of the third quarter, before the home side came to life with the wind at their backs in the final term, with skipper Bonnie Toogood and Amber Clarke reducing the margin to four points. Toogood continued to pepper the scoreboard, but the Eagles held on to secure a rare victory. “We’ve had a horror week back at home, and it’s been really bloody tough on all of us, and Mick as well. I’m just really proud of the girls,” West Coast captain Emma Swanson said post-game on the broadcast. “I can name the whole team. Everyone had their second in the last couple minutes.

“That was such a team effort, everyone had a moment there when they had to put their head over the footy and lay a tackle and not let it slip.” Swanson (25 disposals, eight clearances) stood out for the Eagles, while Bombers workhorse Maddy Prespakis (30 disposals, nine clearances) was typically prominent in the midfield alongside Georgia Nanscawen (21, six). With two rounds left, West Coast have a chance to build their winning streak when they meet the bottom of the table Western Bulldogs next round. Slipping one place to sixth, Essendon have must-win matches against Carlton and Gold Coast on the road to the finals. The Bombers will be without Steph Cain, who was sidelined with a concussion after an elbow to the head from Swanson. AAP Pies hold on against comeback Cats

Sunday’s clash between Collingwood and Geelong at Victoria Park was less about who was the overall better side than it was decided by who could adapt best to the blustery wind and rain. The answer: the Magpies. Collingwood survived a fourth quarter comeback from Geelong to finish with a six-point victory and stay firmly in finals contention, whereas the Cats now face an uphill battle to finish in the eight in two weeks’ time. Jordyn Allen of the Magpies is tackled by Geelong’s Claudia Gunjaca in the round-eight match at Victoria Park. Credit: Getty Geelong scored just one point in the first quarter and had just 1.3 on the board at three-quarter-time, but kicked two goals to none in the final term to close in on Collingwood. Magpies ruck Sabrina Frederick, who starred with 39 hit-outs and used her height to bring the ball to ground at the advantage of her midfielders, said her side had been practising for games like this.

“Even in the chaos, it’s quite comfortable because we train it. We train what scenarios to do in what moments, and even though it’s a bit crazy, it felt so calm. We put players in place and we know what we’re doing,” said Frederick. “But close games are good ones, for everyone. We knew they were going to come out like that [in the last quarter]. When they’re down, they’re just going to give us everything.” Collingwood’s Brianna Davey kicks her team forward against Geelong. Credit: Getty Frederick admitted at times she “couldn’t see” and felt like she could be “blown away”. Geelong coach Daniel Lowther said the strong winds made it hard for his side to clear the ball out of their defensive 50-metre zone and to move the ball with any certainty around the ground.

Loading “At one point the rain hit our box, it was flowing,” Lowther said. “Both teams had to fight in the conditions, but it didn’t help the game. “Our marking contest wasn’t too flash, our ground ball representation was a bit hit and miss, so our defence were under a bit more pressure than they should have been, but they fought back really well,” Lowther said. Collingwood next play a Sydney line-up including former Magpies star Chloe Molloy, while Geelong will take on Richmond at Ikon Park.

Having been on the verge of making their first finals appearance, St Kilda (4-4) could now miss the top eight even if they beat the fourth-placed Brisbane Lions and the ninth-placed Carlton.

Dana East was everywhere for Fremantle, leading the game in disposals (19) and contested possessions (11), alongside Orlagh Lally (19 disposals, five clearances).

Conversely, the score was the most the Saints have conceded in any quarter this season.

Aine Tighe set the tone for the Dockers with a brilliant goal less than 30 seconds into the first quarter, followed by two majors from Gabby O’Sullivan and another by Angelique Stannett. Ella Friend slotted a much-needed goal for the visitors to make it 4.2 (26) to 1.3 (9) at quarter-time. With less than a minute till the long break, captain Hayley Miller (two goals) kicked the only major of the second quarter to give Fremantle a comfortable 26-point lead at half-time. Despite two goals from Tyanna Smith and J’Noemi Anderson in the second half, the Saints struggled to eat into the deficit. Fremantle (4-4) face reigning premiers Melbourne next, before finishing the season against 11th-placed Sydney.

Dogs forward reveals battle with kidney disease Western Bulldogs forward Richelle Cranston has revealed she’s been living, and playing, with stage five chronic kidney disease. “I still manage to do the things I love,” the inaugural AFLW player posted to Instagram. “It’s just really hard sometimes.” Richelle Cranston of the Bulldogs: “It’s just really hard sometimes.” Credit: Getty Images The 34-year-old posted the caption along with a video detailing her life with the disease including weekly blood tests and daily blood pressure checks, tracking water and food intake, taking medications including resonium (to lower potassium levels), all while training in the high-performance environment.

The Dogs are Cranston’s third club after starting at Melbourne and having a stint with Geelong before heading to the Bulldogs last year. Cranston lined up for the Bulldogs in her side’s 57-point loss to Sydney on Saturday at Whitten Oval, 14.12 (96) to 6.3 (39). It was the Western Bulldogs’ eighth loss in a row, and their biggest-ever defeat, and they have just two rounds left to clinch a win this season. They next play 17th-placed West Coast and then top-four side North Melbourne. For the Swans, however, the victory has them challenging for a top-eight spot alongside the likes of Gold Coast, Geelong, Collingwood, St Kilda and Carlton.

The Swans, who went winless in their debut season last year, were propelled to victory by a Chloe Molloy masterclass. After a five-goal second term, which included a four-minute burst of three majors, Sydney had already brought up their largest score in an AFLW game by halftime. Swan Chloe Molloy celebrates a goal. Credit: AFL Photos / Getty Images The Bulldogs held their own in the last quarter, but the damage had already been done. The total was also the biggest the Dogs have conceded in their history, topping the 83 Melbourne kicked against them in round three. Molloy, the Swans’ star off-season recruit, turned on one of the best performances of her career to demolish their injury-hit hosts.

The former Collingwood ace was a class above as she kicked 3.4 from her 28 possessions and played a crucial role in setting up numerous other Sydney goals. Loading “She [Molloy] was itching to get in there [in the midfield],” Swans coach Scott Gowans said. “We kept her forward deliberately. It was important Chloe played a good block of time forward so we could have a look at it.” The Blues lost to Greater Western Sydney by two points on Saturday afternoon, denying them the chance to leapfrog into the top eight, 8.1 (49) to 7.5 (47).

Credit: AFL Photos It was a hard-fought, low-scoring battle between the two powerhouse sides that play a similar game style. Each set up well, are fast and like a good dose of contested marking. But Narrm controlled more of the game by tightening around the contest and being cleaner going forward. They also defended extremely well by suffocating the opportunities North created and prevailed 5.7 (37) to 2.2 (14). While the Demons scored just one goal a quarter in the second half – Tyla Hanks in the third and Eden Zanker in the fourth – the Kangaroos were goalless for three terms, having led by five points at the first change. Their opening goals were thanks to Niamh Martin and Tess Craven.

Then a crafty goal from Demons skipper Kate Hore to open the second term put her side up, and Melbourne never gave up the lead. Hanks was pivotal for the Demons and starred with 26 disposals, seven tackles and one goal, while her partner in the midfield Olivia Purcell had 28 touches, five clearances and five tackles. For the Roos, Ash Riddell led the disposal count with 31, while skipper Emma Kearney was crucial in defence. Melbourne’s Alyssa Bannan is tackled by Lulu Pullar of the Kangaroos.

Lions roar in big battle Meanwhile, on Saturday afternoon, the Brisbane Lions put an end to Adelaide’s unbeaten run with a three-point victory at Brighton Homes Arena in a top-four thriller, 5.12 (42) to 6.3 (39), in a spectacle worthy of being a final.

The Crows then took back control in the third with three goals to none, which set the stage for a tense final term. The fourth quarter was a heated arm wrestle, and scores were tied with four minutes left on the clock. The Lions’ Bella Dawes kicked the only goal of the last term, but it was a series of behinds in the final minutes that won the game for them, including one from Lily Postlethwaite that broke the stalemate.

Adelaide’s Niamh Kelly navigates her way through traffic against brisbane. Credit: Getty The two sides have had intense battles in the competition’s history, including two grand finals, and this was no different. If the Lions had lost, they were at risk of falling out of the top four with second-season side Essendon chasing their spot. Last season’s best and fairest Ally Anderson said her side loved playing at its training ground in Springfield, which it has made a fortress, and work well in hot conditions . “It was really hot. It was a grind… But yeah, it was a good finish,” Anderson told Fox Footy post-game. “Every week that we play here, every time that we play here, we get better and better. So, it was just a matter of time before we finally got the first win and then it hopefully [will] open the floodgates a bit.”

The Lions next play St Kilda before taking on the reigning premiers Melbourne in the final round. After this weekend, they have staked their claim as being premiership contenders again. Adelaide will play top-four side North Melbourne next weekend before 18th-placed Western Bulldogs. Comeback kings Richmond take the points in Cairns A late goal by Emelia Yassir has helped Richmond to their first win in four games, putting their AFLW finals campaign back on track with an 11-point victory over Hawthorn.

Credit: Getty Images Separated by one point at half-time and down by nine points entering the last quarter, the Tigers pulled off a 6.5 (41) to 4.6 (30) victory to keep their finals hopes alive at Cazaly’s Stadium in Cairns on Friday night.

Hawthorn were limited to just one point in the decisive final quarter. Midfield duo Monique Conti (35 disposals, seven clearances) and Grace Egan (28, 5) were typically influential for Richmond, while Hawthorn were led by Emily Bates (18, four) and Jasmine Fleming (18, one). “Richmond were just absolute beasts, especially their midfielders. They really worked hard all night,” Hawthorn coach Bec Goddard said after the game. “Our work rate really dropped off and we just watched them play some really good footy. “If you’re a Hawks fan, you would’ve seen some really exciting moments of footy tonight.

“Keep getting excited. We are coming, we’re growing, we’re getting better.” Hawthorn’s Irish ace Aine McDonagh kicked the opening goal before Tigers skipper Katie Brennan slotted two unanswered majors to celebrate her 50th game in style. Fellow 50-gamer Greta Bodey put boot to ball to snatch her own goal before quarter-time. A skirmish erupted in the second term after Brennan took exception to a tackle by Mattea Breed on Laura McClelland. McClelland was gifted a 50-metre penalty following a bump against Sarah Hosking by Sophie Locke and converted from inside the goal square while players were occupied by the tussle.

Bridie Hipwell kicked the only goal of the third quarter to give Hawthorn a game-high nine-point lead. Loading Richmond rebounded in the last term, with Courtney Jones ending Hawthorn’s three-goal run with her first touch of the night, cutting the margin to three points. Dogged by inaccuracy in front of goal, Yassir reduced the deficit to a single point before finally breaking through on her third attempt.

With only 0.4 of a percentage point separating Sydney in ninth and St Kilda in eighth, the win assured the Swans of retaking eighth spot. If the Saints had qualified, it would have been their maiden finals appearance. Saints goalkicker Jesse Wardlaw had a heavy collision with Carlton’s Keeley Sherar late in the final quarter of their clash.

Georgia Patrikios showed her class in the do-or-die match, collecting 25 disposals and eight contested possessions in a powerhouse display, while Hannah Priest was a brick wall in defence, with nine intercept possessions. Abbie McKay worked overtime to counter Patrikios in the midfield, but her side was outclassed across the park. McKay racked up 28 disposals and 12 clearances alongside Mimi Hill (30 disposals), while defender Sherar (17) toiled against a potent Saints attack. Meanwhile, Sydney prevailed in a fierce tug-of-war with the Dockers to seal their first AFLW finals appearance. Down by four points at half-time in the low-scoring game, a third-term goal from Rebecca Privitelli sparked the Swans to a 5.10 (40) to 2.6 (18) win on Sunday at Fremantle Oval.

The second-year expansion side stormed home with three unanswered goals to secure eighth spot. It’s a dramatic improvement, with the Swans winless in their first season. “Any club that’s able to go from winless one year to a finals berth, it’s incredible,” Sydney co-captain Chloe Molloy told Fox Footy after the match. “You can see the emotion on the girls’ faces. Coming into the season, the odds were against us. Just to get into the eight, we’ve managed to do that. We’re stoked. It’s pretty special for the club.” Missing star ruck Ally Morphett to a season-ending wrist injury, Laura Gardiner stood the tallest in the midfield, while Molloy (two goals), Montana Ham, Privitelli and Brooke Lochland hit the scoreboard. An off-season recruit from Geelong, 20-year-old Gardiner had the ball on a string with a game-high 33 disposals and 18 contested possessions.

Demons denied the minor premiership The Brisbane Lions have toppled AFLW heavyweights Melbourne by 25 points to clinch a double chance in the finals and deny the Demons the minor premiership. A year after Melbourne walked away with the 2022 premiership, the Lions avenged their upset grand final loss by defeating the defending premiers 8.5 (53) to 4.4 (28) at Brighton Homes Arena on Saturday.

Meanwhile, Melbourne ceded the minor premiership to Adelaide and dropped to second spot. The Lions put on a show across the park, with powerhouse duo Ally Anderson (22 disposals) and Jade Ellenger (22) going to work in the midfield while Dakota Davidson (two goals) led the charge in the forward line. Captain Bre Koenen was superb in defence as she played on Melbourne’s leader Kate Hore, collecting a game-high 12 intercept possessions and limiting the prolific goalkicker to just one goal. Lions duo Charlotte Mullins and Ruby Svarc celebrate. Credit: Getty Images The Lions got the game on their terms early with five repeat entries into the attacking 50m in the opening 10 minutes of the game. Davidson and Ellie Hampson drew first blood before Casey Sherriff kicked Melbourne’s opening goal.

Tayla Harris, Tyla Hanks and Hore slotted a goal each in the second term to put their side ahead. Crumbling under the Brisbane attack, the visitors conceded four unanswered goals from Taylor Smith, Sophie Conway (two goals) and Ruby Svarc while remaining goalless in the third term. Midfield stars Olivia Purcell (14 contested possessions) and Tyla Hanks (11) showed their mettle as they attempted to drag their side over the line, but the Demons were outclassed and sorely missing Paxy Paxman (hamstring). Melbourne could be without Maeve Chaplin in their finals campaign, after the defender sustained a concussion injury in the third term. AAP Cats secure elimination final home-ground advantage

Geelong have not only secured their spot in the top eight with a huge 40-point win over Hawthorn on Saturday at GMHBA Stadium but locked in home-ground advantage for the first elimination final. The Cats finished sixth, with the 9.6 (60) to 3.2 (20) win over the Hawks boosting their percentage to a healthy 141.2, almost 40 ahead of Essendon, who sit one rung below them on equal points. Momentum is also in Geelong’s favour after two big wins in a row, having demolished Richmond by 38 points last weekend. Chloe Scheer (left) and Julia Crockett-Grills of the Cats celebrate. Credit: Getty Against the Hawks, they controlled ball movement from the get-go, kicking four goals straight to open the match and keeping their opposition goalless to half-time.

Chloe Scheer was once again the star in front of goals with three majors, while the Cats finished with seven individual goalkickers. Georgie Prespakis (35 touches, eight clearances) and Amy McDonald (23 touches, eight clearances) were a formidable midfield duo, while the retiring Renee Garing had a whopping 11 tackles. Overall, it was a strong team effort from a side that will be hungry for a finals win. Last year, the Cats had an impressive home-and-away run but bowed out narrowly in an elimination final to North Melbourne. Geelong young defender Rebecca Webster told this masthead earlier in the week how important the home crowd is for them come knockout finals. “Playing at GMHBA is like a massive advantage for us,” said Webster. “We love going in those four walls. We train there three, four times a week. So having that familiarity of the ground is awesome ... So I would be super-excited to make finals for one, but then play at home would be just that extra and having all our support behind us really drives us on the field.” Tears abound in Phillips’ emotional farewell

There were emotional scenes at Alberton Oval as the siren sounded on AFLW great Erin Phillips’ last game, with Port Adelaide saluting her with a huge 58-point win over Greater Western Sydney on Saturday. The crowd, which included Phillips’ father Greg and mother Julie (both in tears after the game), more family and friends, and Adelaide captain Chelsea Randall, erupted as the curtain finally came down for the three-time premiership player after eight seasons and 67 games. “It was an awesome game and four quarters of Port Adelaide footy … It was awesome to finish up like that,” Phillips told Fox Footy after the 13.10 (88) to 4.6 (30) win over the Giants.

Richelle Cranston of the Bulldogs is chaired off the ground by teammates Isabelle Pritchard and Ellie Blackburn after announcing her retirement. Credit: Getty The 38-year-old kicked a momentous goal from a set shot in the final quarter, and she was smothered by her jubilant teammates afterwards. “I don’t think I’ve been as nervous to kick a goal in my life, to be honest,” she joked. “But nah, it was awesome.” On Saturday, the competition also said goodbye to a range of players including Western Bulldogs forward Richelle Cranston, who has battled stage five chronic kidney disease while playing this season, and Hawthorn’s Akec Makur Chuot, who played 40 games for three clubs.

Cranston, who was an inaugural AFLW player, will start kidney dialysis in January so had no option but to hang up the boots and focus on her treatment and health. “[I’m feeling] sad. Emotions hit me when the siren went. It’s been a really emotional week, the girls have really gotten around me. But yeah, my health has sort of deteriorated, it’s been a really hard year,” Cranston told Fox Footy after the Bulldogs lost to North Melbourne 7.13 (55) to 1.3 (9). “But I go out with on a happy note. I love these girls and I’ll be over at the pancake pocket [Pancake Parlour at Whitten Oval] watching them from now on and have a few bevs on the sideline.” Roos’ lock in top-four spot; Dogs have issues to work through in off-season North Melbourne secured third spot on the ladder and the double chance in finals after downing the Western Bulldogs by a whopping 46 points. They will head into finals with momentum but a glaring issue to work on: kicking accuracy. Despite the comfortable win, they could have done a lot more damage after booting double the number of behinds to goals.

Star midfielder Ash Riddell, who had 36 touches and seven clearances, said she was excited to go up against Melbourne or Adelaide in the first weekend of finals depending on other results this round, as they were the only two sides who beat them this year. “I’m excited like I think the group’s coming together really nicely and where really well-prepared compared to previous years,” Riddell told Fox Footy. “So, I can’t wait I think it’s an exciting time for us.” The game was one-way traffic against the Dogs with the game played almost entirely in the Roos’ attacking half. Riddell credited her side’s “team performance” after two losses to the Dees and Crows. North Melbourne have secured a top-four spot for finals. Credit: Getty For the Western Bulldogs, it was another tough day out as they notched their ninth loss of the season. They won just one game this year, an eight-point victory last weekend over 17th-placed West Coast.

Britney Gutknecht kicked the Dogs’ only goal against the Kangaroos, which came early in the final term to avoid a record for the lowest AFLW score in the history of the competition. The Dogs have plenty to work on for next season as they look to regain a competitive edge, which was lost after a finals berth last year. Along with being in a rebuild, they were badly injury-hit this season and used 32 players, more than any other club. Suns secure finals spot AAP Unsung hero Lucy Single has helped Gold Coast book their second AFLW finals appearance with a 14-point win over Essendon. Losing midfield powerhouse Charlie Rowbottom to an ankle injury proved no obstacle in the Suns’ maiden clash with the Bombers, as they finished the regular season in fifth spot after a 6.3 (39) to 3.7 (25) victory to kick off pride round at Great Barrier Reef Arena on Friday.

While their men’s side have yet to make a finals appearance, this is the second time Gold Coast’s women have clinched a play-off spot, having also done so in the cancelled 2020 season. Single filled the massive Rowbottom-size gap, collecting 25 disposals and six clearances in her prolific performance across the field while also playing a crucial tagging role on Maddy Prespakis.

Prespakis was held to eight contested possessions, well below a season average of 14 per game, while Georgia Nanscawen proved a potent threat with 13 contested possessions and three score involvements.

The Bombers broke through first with a goal from Amber Clarke but young talent Darcie Davies (two goals) was able to respond after being gifted 50 metres from a protected area infringement by Mia Bush. Daisy D’Arcy, Jacqueline Dupuy, Jamie Stanton and Davies attempted to break away from the low-scoring tug-of-war in the second with goals of their own. But two goals from Amelia Radford and Georgia Gee kept the hosts close, while defender Ellyse Gamble (nine intercept possessions) proved a roadblock for the Suns’ attackers. Single lit up the park with a clinical slice through the corridor, dodging two tackles to put the ball in the hands of Georgia Clayden, who capped the centre clearance with the only major of the third term.

sports,Jack Snape,2023-10-26T23:42:29+00:00,"Quince paste and hand-picked grapes have played a part in helping the Sydney Swans launch themselves to the top of the AFLW attendance charts, less than two years after their first match in the women’s league.

The Swans play their final home match of the regular season this weekend with an average attendance of 4,365 from four games so far – 124 more than the next best club Adelaide – and a marquee pride match against Collingwood at Henson Park to come on Sunday where a crowd in excess of 4,000 is expected.

The club’s focus has been to target local communities and make match days compelling for fans on and off the field, according to executive GM of marketing at the Swans, Loretta Johns.

“Our team has put a lot of work into sourcing some wonderful food offerings, entertainment and activities for kids, while we’ve had a local focus in promoting our games,” she said.

Fans of Australian rules football in the Harbour City have a reputation for being fickle. After a winless campaign in 2022, the Swans – led by ex-Collingwood player Chloe Molloy – have been competitive this season. The team won their first AFLW match in round one and are within a game of the top eight with two rounds to play.

But general manager of women’s football at the AFL, Nicole Livingstone, said the Swans’ off-field offering had tapped into something “uniquely Sydney” and helped make matches more attractive.

“To go to North Sydney Oval and to have quince paste and hand-picked grapes, cheddar cheese and biscuits in a little box that’s got this beautiful wrapping on it – they’ve really thought about what they’re doing and made it an experience,” she said.

“Even at Henson Park [the Swans’ other home ground in Sydney’s gentrified inner west], they’ve gone to microbreweries in the local area and invited them in, but also promoted through their clientele to come to the football.”

The Swans forward Bella Smith said the players were proud of the club’s attendance record, and were grateful for the support. “We get there two hours before the start of the game and the hill [at Henson Park] is bare. When you come out for the first team warm-up, the hill is slowly filling and then by the time the first bounce gets around, it is full,” she said. “You can hear it, the atmosphere is amazing.”

The average attendance for the AFLW is a little over 2,500 a match this year, tracking approximately on par with previous seasons and with a finals uptick likely to come. But crowds are short of targets that could accelerate the extension of the regular season, which grows from 10 games this year to 12 games by 2025.

The league enjoyed strong attendances in round one, which were partly attributed to the so-called Matildas effect, but some clubs have struggled to attract fans in large numbers this season. Crowds of less than 1,500 have been recorded in both traditional markets such as Melbourne and Perth, as well as areas targeted for growth like Blacktown and the Gold Coast.

The A-League Women launched this month with a first round highlighted by a crowd of more than 11,000 in Sydney. But more modest attendances in subsequent games, including two sub-2,000 crowds in Perth, suggest the popularity of the Matildas’ run to the semi-finals has only had a limited impact on support for domestic women’s sport.

Livingstone said the “green and gold fever” associated with the Women’s World Cup was a one-off and the AFL has plans in place for long-term growth. “We’ll continue to keep building the base and keep building the foundations and have it not just strong at year seven, season eight, but strong for generations to come.”

In a bid to improve the spectacle of the AFLW, the league introduced longer quarters this year and an interchange cap to help increase scoring. The effect, according to Livingstone, has been positive.

“We’ve increased game time by eight minutes per match, on average, and we’ve had record scores across the rounds,” she said. “Whereas leading into the season we hadn’t scored more than 100 goals in a round, we’ve regularly been scoring over 100 goals in a round.”

The Swans recorded their highest total last round, in their 14-12-96 to 6-3-39 defeat of the Western Bulldogs, the league’s winless bottom side. Molloy recorded 17 score involvements to set a new AFLW mark.

But Livingstone said the AFL was happy with the level of competition. “Our ladder, from position five to 13 – there’s only a game separating it. It just shows that this is a really competitive competition.”",Craft beer and cheese boxes: Swans tap into something ‘uniquely Sydney’ to draw AFLW crowds | Jack Snape,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/oct/27/craft-beer-and-cheese-boxes-swans-tap-in-something-uniquely-sydney-to-draw-aflw-crowds,The Guardian

They sang the name of Erik ten Hag’s predecessor. Not in a gesture of dissent, but as a reminder of a time when Manchester United were Europe’s best and an evening without which a certain Norwegian would never have become their manager two decades later. After all, who put the ball in the Germans’ net? Ole Gunnar Solskjaer. But that was a different millennium, a different United. Nostalgia underpinned Solskjaer’s management. Ten Hag cannot call upon his personal history in such a way; the Champions League final he almost reached was with Ajax. His past does not offer the protection that means his name will always be sung at Old Trafford.

And, 24 years after Solskjaer’s stunning intervention, another United Champions League campaign finished against Bayern Munich. Not in glory, but ignominy. Like Solskjaer, Kingsley Coman has a winner in a Champions League final; this time the winger finished off United, condemning them to a seventh home defeat of the season. In a sense, it may have been the most respectable: United were vaguely competent on the night, but utterly incompetent over the course of a wretched campaign.

There was no hint of a repeat of their most famous comeback against Bayern, ensuring Solskjaer’s name will forever be bracketed with Teddy Sheringham’s. There was not even the sense of heroic failure that accompanied their quarter-final exit to Bayern in 2010. There was just crushing failure. Because it wasn’t Bayern who eliminated them. It was Galatasaray, who won at Old Trafford and scored six goals over 180 minutes against United. It was FC Copenhagen, who qualified instead of them. Rasmus Hojlund’s former club will be in the last 16. His current one won’t. Copenhagen will be the anomalies in the draw, the outsiders with the spot that had seemed reserved for United.

Manchester United’s defeat means they miss out on a spot in the Europa League (PA)

Instead, they are cast out of continental competition altogether. Europe’s sinking superpower have become just the fourth English team to prop up a Champions League group when it concluded. There was something predictable about the manner of their demise; their defence was unlocked by Harry Kane, with a lovely flick. The England captain is the forward United neglected to bid for in the summer. The one they did buy, Hojlund, has at least struck in the Champions League but in domestic competitions he has been outscored 18-0 by Kane.

Yet a rookie centre-forward is not the culprit in chief. For Ten Hag, this has been a chastening setback; with Sir Jim Ratcliffe set to finalise his investment, with United listing in the Premier League, the chances are the Dutchman has managed them in the Champions League for the last time.

Go back four years and it required a 96th minute goal by Lucas Moura to stop him from reaching the final. Now the less heralded Lukas Lerager signalled United’s demise, putting Copenhagen ahead against Galatasaray when United needed a draw to preserve their own chances of qualification; that, and a victory over Bayern. Which, as the German champions have not lost in 40 group-stage games in this competition and United have not beaten anyone resembling a top team this season, always felt unlikely.

This was far from their worst performance of the season, nowhere near as bad as Bournemouth or Crystal Palace or Newcastle, or the other defeat to Newcastle. They were not as self-destructive as they had been in Denmark and Turkey and at home to Galatasaray. But they still lost.

And they still went out, with four points, in fourth place. Go back a couple of months and Raphael Varane had said United could win the Champions League. On a night when Ten Hag seemed to revise his opinion of the quadruple Champions League winner, the defender may need a rethink. Instead, United won a lone game in it and even that required a penalty save to deny FC Copenhagen a draw.

Varane was summoned from his inexplicable exile, after a 10-game absence when both Luke Shaw and Jonny Evans were preferred at centre-back to a World Cup winner. He performed with an assurance to make his omission all the odder, but it has scarcely been the only U-turn in selection; with Harry Maguire and Scott McTominay, Ten Hag is compiling a group who were first out of his plans and then back in. For a manager who likes to project an image of strong, decisiveness leadership, he has had to reverse course rather too often. But then his team are going backwards.

When Coman scored, United became the first Premier League side to concede 15 goals in a Champions League group stage. When Maguire hobbled off, holding his groin, and Evans came on, United had a man who played in United’s 2007-08 Champions League-winning campaign, dragooned into service 16 years later. They will always have the past at Old Trafford, but Evans may be consigned to it; perhaps, in time, Ten Hag, too.",Erik ten Hag could pay the price for Manchester United’s incompetent Champions League campaign,https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/erik-ten-hag-manchester-united-champions-league-exit-b2462804.html,The Independent - Sports
sports,Peter Ryan,2023-09-30T22:45:39+00:00,"Adams and McStay – who arrived from the Lions in the off-season as an unrestricted free agent – leaned on each other to cope with the difficult moment, and needed some privacy to deal with their personal misfortune before they could share in the team’s raucous celebrations. McStay may need as many as eight weeks to recover from the high-grade medial collateral ligament strain he suffered in the club’s preliminary final win. Collingwood’s injured recruit Dan McStay at training before the grand final. Credit: Eddie Jim “We shed a few tears and a bit of emotion, then we brushed it off and said, ‘Let’s get on with it and go celebrate with the boys’. It was a great night,” Adams said. John Noble was another sad story, playing every game in the home-and-away season, only to be dropped for Collingwood’s qualifying final clash with Melbourne and never forcing his way back in.

Nathan Murphy, who took no further part in the grand final after being concussed in a clash with Brisbane’s Linc McCarthy, spared a thought for all three players amid the post-match chaos. “It was pretty emotional seeing them. You go from one high like myself to a low like theirs,” Murphy said. “You’ve got to put yourself in their shoes, and see that, but they’re so good. They’re turning it into a positive, and they’re just happy for everyone else’s success, so it’s awesome.” The trio’s grand final heartbreak sparked renewed debate about whether every player on the list should receive a premiership medallion, or at least those who played a certain number of games. First-year Magpie Oleg Markov has experienced both sides of the ledger. He played in Saturday’s premiership, but missed out on all three Richmond flags (2017, 2019 and 2020) despite playing senior games in each of those years. Markov is “a big advocate” for all players being recognised.

“The best thing we can do is wrap our arms around them, and just let him feel what we sort of feel,” he said. “I’ve been on the other side of the fence, and it is hard because you’re seeing all your friends succeed and sort of living the dream that you aspire to have, but I know it makes people hungrier. I know the boys who missed out will be the ones who are training the house down, and pushing the boys who have seen the mountain top. They’re going to motivate the boys to try and see it again.” ‘Incredibly sore’: Howe played out decider with rib injury Peter Ryan

This wasn’t the type of “car crash” injury Jeremy Howe has suffered before, but it was brutal nonetheless. The high-flying Magpie has revealed he played out the grand final in pain after he was floored by a bone-crunching knock to the ribs from Lions forward Charlie Cameron during the last quarter. Jeremy Howe was collected by Charlie Cameron late in the game Credit: Getty Images

Cameron crashed into Howe as he cleared the ball from Collingwood’s defence, leaving him gasping on the ground with badly bruised ribs. The Magpies defender is accustomed to extreme pain, having broken his arm in six places after a sickening midair collision in the opening round of the season. This pain was tolerable by comparison, and he got up and played out the match, helping Collingwood hold on to a four-point win in one of the great grand finals. “The incident late in the game with Charlie ... He managed to hit me relatively late, it was probably in play, [but I] got a down-field free kick,” Howe told Channel Nine on Sunday. Jeremy Howe’s rib injury did not prevent him celebrating Collingwood’s premiership. Credit: Getty

“The ribs are incredibly sore but I think if we lost they’d be sorer. “I’ve got six months to get them right. I can tolerate the pain for now. I bounced out of bed regardless.” Leading into the finals Howe said the bone had protruded from his arm when he crashed-landed in round one, describing the excruciating pain, and he came back from a horrific knee injury in 2020. Did Markov join his pole-vaulting father as a world champ? Oleg Markov is revelling in his fairytale ascension from the AFL scrapheap to Collingwood premiership hero, eight months after trialling with Carlton.

Any further proof required for how beloved the mustachioed dasher is among the Magpie army was delivered emphatically on Sunday at club headquarters, where fans chanted his name, soccer style. “At first, when it started, I was a bit embarrassed, but I think since embracing it and sort of smiling, I kind of enjoy it now,” Markov told The Age. “I’m super grateful that I’ve got a little chant like that, and hopefully, it’s a little legacy I can continue, and I’m just happy the Magpie army are looking after me. I feel like they’re always on my side, no matter what mistake I make ... if anything, they motivate me to continue to take the game on and just be my true self.” Markov felt like he was cheating on Collingwood when he began training with the Blues, after finding out the Pies overlooked him for what was then their final list spot.

That followed Gold Coast delisting the 27-year-old, who also played 23 games for Richmond. There was interest in him at the time, but he feared his career might be over. “I went through the national draft and no one looked into me, so there were technically 17 clubs that didn’t really want me,” he said. “And, to be honest, maybe 18, after I didn’t get the last list spot at Collingwood, but I’m glad the stars aligned the way they did.” In a twist of fate, defender Charlie Dean re-fractured his right foot at training, opening another list spot for Collingwood to snatch Markov back from Carlton – and the rest is history. “Having trained at Collingwood for two months, I felt like I was almost doing the dirty on ‘Fly’ [Craig McRae], going behind his back – I was almost like a cheater,” he said. “He was very respectful and understanding, and it probably allowed me to open myself up and be vulnerable to that football club. I’m super grateful for them showing interest in me, in the first place.

“I know I’ve signed with [Collingwood] and on the dotted lines, I’ve agreed to hate Carlton, but there’s a bit of me that is really grateful and appreciative to them.” McRae revealed post-grand final he wrote “44 sons” under his shirt collar, and he urged his players before the season started to come up with something similar for themselves. Markov kept his message private, but said the idea was for them to pick words that summed up how they wanted to be remembered. “It was almost like writing a tombstone or eulogy for yourself,” he said. “We picked one or two words that we wanted to live by. Everyone had their own, so some people chose really powerful words to do with football and others chose words to do with life, or whether it was repaying someone.

“Fly spoke about his being the 44 sons. Hearing that, it definitely made me realise all year that’s how I felt, and I can vouch for all the boys – that’s how we felt. We felt like he was a father figure for us more than a coach.” Markov’s actual father, Dmitri, famously won the men’s pole vault at the 2001 world championships, so his role in the Magpies’ triumph continues the family’s sporting success. “I’m very lucky. Dad thinks it’s a bit harder in a team sport because everyone has to perform,” Markov said. “He said, ‘Hey, AFL is only in Australia, but, technically, you are a world champ,’ so I think I’ve matched him for now. I’d like to get another one, and hopefully, I can one-up him, but I think he’s got the cake at the moment.” Pies’ premiership ‘just the beginning’: Maynard

Marc McGowan

Brayden Maynard has warned Collingwood’s breakthrough premiership is just the beginning as they bid to become the AFL’s next dynasty team. Brisbane Lions (2001-03), Geelong (2007, 2009, 2011), Hawthorn (2013-15) and Richmond (2017, 2019-20) all won three flags in short succession this century, with the Magpies’ challenge now to back up their memorable season. Brayden Maynard enjoys the Pies’ win. Credit: Eddie Jim Maynard initially baulked when asked whether Collingwood could win back-to-back flags, but said their bulletproof culture instilled belief they could “do anything”. “We’ve got to lap [this premiership] up, and we’re going to have some serious fun, and we might burn down Melbourne,” a still-disbelieving Maynard said.

“I’m looking forward to celebrating with the team because it’s taken two years of getting after it and getting better every day – we’ve got better for this moment. Loading “We just want to win. We come into the club every day and get better, and we just set ourselves up, so when we come to game day, we know we’ve done everything, to get the result we want.” Maynard had a tumultuous start to September after his infamous collision with Melbourne’s Angus Brayshaw left the Demon concussed and him defending himself at the tribunal. With a three-match ban hanging over his head, Maynard feared his dream to achieve premiership glory could be lost before he beat the charge.

Collingwood’s triumph helped banish the pain of their grand final defeat to West Coast in 2018, when Maynard was unfortunate not to receive a free kick for a block against Willie Rioli in the same passage that led to Dom Sheed’s match-winning goal. “Everyone knows that was a bizarre and crazy sort of week, mentally [after the Brayshaw incident],” Maynard said. “I wasn’t going well because of the what-ifs, if I missed this. That’s exactly why I struggled bad that whole week. I got quite emotional after the game, giving Dad a big hug, because he’s been by my side, and we did it. “My whole family – my dad, my brother [ex-Demon Corey], my mum – and everyone at this club has helped me, and this team, to get where we need to be.” McRae reveals hidden message under the collar of his grand final shirt

Peter Ryan

Collingwood coach Craig McRae had the message “44 sons” written under the collar of the shirt he wore through Saturday’s epic grand final to signify how he felt about each player in the Magpies squad during 2023 as they drove towards a premiership. McRae revealed the legacy theme when he spoke to players, coaches, past players, club employees, and their friends and family at Collingwood’s official post-premiership celebrations held at Centrepiece in Melbourne on Saturday night. Craig McRae with Brayden Maynard. Credit: AFL Photos / Getty Images He said each player on the list did the same, inscribing a personal message under the collar of their own jumper with words describing the legacy they wanted to leave as a person and a player in 2023. “All the players had inside their jumper something they want to be remembered for,” McRae said.

“It was an action. It was theirs ... when we created legacy, today players ideally lived theirs. In my shirt I had [written] 44 sons. I’ve got three beautiful daughters now, I don’t have a son, but I consider all these guys in the squad my sons, so I wore that under my collar today.” The Magpies coach said on Saturday night he was yet to return to St Vincent’s Hospital where his wife Gabrielle gave birth to their daughter Maggie at 7.45am on grand final morning. Gabrielle went to the hospital with her sister at 10pm on Friday night after going into labour, before ringing McRae at 6am to join them at the hospital to be with them when the baby was born. Collingwood president Jeff Browne praised McRae and the players for their character and driving the change the club undertook when the new coach was appointed. He said the win was “the ultimate satisfaction” for him, and he was rapt to be there after a health scare put him in hospital briefly on the eve of the finals.

“[It was] a bit of pit stop, a little bit of late pre-season training and got myself back into it,” Browne said. Past presidents Mark Korda and Eddie McGuire, as well as previous coach and champion player Nathan Buckley, Anthony Rocca, Luke Ball and Sharrod Wellingham were among the throng celebrating the club’s 16th premiership. Browne said the club wanted to recognise and acknowledge that any success was built on the efforts of those who went before them. “We are one big club. We are Collingwood ... this club has got a rich history, and days like this celebrate that history and salute the people that have gone before. We should never forget that,” Browne said.",McRae reveals hidden message he carried under collar of his grand final shirt,https://www.smh.com.au/sport/afl/mcrae-reveals-hidden-message-he-carried-under-collar-of-his-grand-final-shirt-20231001-p5e8tl.html?ref=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_source=rss_sport_afl,The Sydney Morning Herald
sports,Bill Bender,2023-11-25T23:20:56+00:00,"ANN ARBOR, Mich. – Michigan quarterback J.J. McCarthy heard Zak Zinter scream. McCarthy saw tackle Karsen Barnhart holding Zinter's foot in the air. This was a gruesome scene at Michigan Stadium on Saturday.

No. 3 Michigan lost their senior All-American guard to a broken tibia and fibula with 2:19 left in the third quarter of a tie game with No. 2 Ohio State. Zinter was carted off in what could have been a turning point in the other direction given his value on the interior line.

""It was a sight that I wouldn't wish upon anyone to see,"" McCarthy said. ""At that moment, seeing the look in everyone's eyes, seeing them rally together, it was spiritual, honestly. It was a different drive that hit on everybody.""

On the next play, senior running back Blake Corum finally broke through the second level of the Buckeyes' defense for a 22-yard go-ahead touchdown. Corum flashed Zinter's number ""65"" with his hands. From there, the Wolverines handled business for a third straight year in The Game in a 30-24 victory.

Michigan tops Ohio State again

Michigan (12-0) beat Ohio State (11-1) for the third straight season. Corum, who missed last year's 45-23 victory against the Buckeyes because of a knee injury, could feel Zinter's pain.

""Zak's my guy,"" Corum said. ""He's another guy that came back for unfinished business. That's why he came back. Seeing him go down and hurt, it was very emotional seeing what he was going through. We came together, and we knew we had to do it for him. The very next play, 'Boom.'""

Boom, indeed. This Michigan story is far from over.

It will continue at least into the Big Ten championship game against No. 17 Iowa. You know that off-the-field story by now. That is the one where this team continues to overcome obstacles – self-inflicted and otherwise. The on-field story is a withering march through the Big Ten toward a third straight College Football Playoff berth.

It could have ended with Ohio State. Jim Harbaugh's three-game suspension from the Big Ten as a result of the illegal in-person scouting and sign-stealing operation dominated headlines more than the Wolverines dominated opponents in the second half of the season. Ohio State had not lost three in a row to Michigan since 1995-97.

The Buckeyes were due, right?

Michigan acting coach Sherrone Moore had other plans. He beat Ohio State coach Ryan Day. Cornerback Will Johnson set the tone by intercepting Ohio State quarterback Kyle McCord with 7:32 left in the first quarter. That set the Wolverines up at the 7-yard line. Corum slammed into the line of scrimmage three times before a fourth-and-1.

Corum heard Moore scream, ""Smash."" Tight end A.J. Barner did his best Triple H impersonation in the huddle: ""It's time to play the game.""

Michigan goes for it on 4th and goal and Blake Corum punches it in for The Game's first touchdown.



That's Corum's 21st touchdown run of the season 😲pic.twitter.com/TrF5pIpni3 — 247Sports (@247Sports) November 25, 2023

""I gotta score,"" Corum said. ""Run through the hole and I'm about to run somebody over. That makes the hairs on my arm stick up.""

Corum scored on a one-yard touchdown for a 7-0 lead. Michigan never played from behind against the Buckeyes. What was Moore thinking in that situation?

""Let's go,"" Moore said. ""That's it. The players just practiced so well this week, and when you have confidence they are going to execute at a high level, it's just like first down.""

Moore favored a conservative game plan the previous two weeks against No. 11 Penn State and Maryland; one that amounted to 91 running plays and 31 pass attempts. Yet he was the aggressor in The Game. The Wolverines converted three fourth-down conversions in the first half. McCarthy – who finished 16 of 20 for 148 yards and a TD – threw a 22-yard touchdown to Roman Wilson between two defenders for a 14-3 lead.

Interim coach Sherrone Moore leads Michigan to win

​​""Coach Moore said from the get-go that he was going to the most-aggressive game he's ever called,"" McCarthy said. ""For the big boys, for Blake, for myself, that's music to our ears that he has the confidence in us to go get the extra yard or two yards. That's who we are.""

Michigan played to win the game. Ohio State, not so much. The Buckeyes settled for a 52-yard field goal late in the first half, which Jayden Fielding missed wide left.

Even when Ohio State tied the score at 17-17 with 6:08 left in the third quarter on an up-tempo drive that featured eight straight run plays and a TreVeyon Henderson touchdown, Michigan answered. The Wolverines scored on every drive in the second half – three field goals and a touchdown.

""It goes back to how they prepare, how they attack things and how they work,"" Moore said. ""I would be doing them a disservice if I went out there and was conservative.""

Say what you will about the adults who were involved in the in-person scouting scandal. Staffer Conor Stallions and assistant coach Chris Partridge are gone. Harbaugh was suspended. He addressed the team Friday, and McCarthy listened closely.

""The one thing he said that stuck out, the whole mantra, 'The Team, The Team, The Team,'"" McCarthy said. ""He said we are that team.""

That is true. This is the most mature player-led Michigan football team on the field since 1997 – when the program beat Ohio State 20-14 in a top-five showdown and split the national championship with Nebraska.

Since then, the Buckeyes found a way in these high-magnitude games, with 2006 and 2016 the best examples. On a stage that was somewhere in between those classics, the Wolverines pointed the pressure in the other direction. Marvin Harrison Jr. had five catches for 118 yards and a TD, but Michigan ran seven minutes off the clock after that with a field goal. That will be the other point of criticism for Day and defensive coordinator Jim Knowles.

MORE: Will Texas A&M pursue Ryan Day?

Ohio State had one minute to score in the end, but Michigan safety Rod Moore, a Clayton, Ohio, product, came up with the game-sealing interception in yet another recurring theme from the 1990s.

The Wolverines aren't just winning this game now. They expect to win this game. Just like last year, McCarthy and Corum took turns repeating the famous Kobe Bryant mantra in the post-game press conference.

""The job is not finished,"" McCarthy said. ""We've been here before.""

""We've been going through things all year, so we know how to stick together and play for each other and always have our brother's back,"" Corum said.

They have, and the last two years ended with victories in the Big Ten championship game before losses to Georgia and TCU in the CFP semifinals. The NCAA investigation will continue, but if Saturday proved anything, the Wolverines will play out the rest of the season on their terms.

This Michigan story is far from over, and Harbaugh returns Monday.

Boom, indeed.","Michigan conquers Ohio State again, but the story is far from over for 2023 Wolverines",https://www.sportingnews.com/us/ncaa-football/news/michigan-conquers-ohio-state-again-story-far-over/797e0148646f5d0d76ae74ee,Sporting News
sports,Emily Dozier,2023-10-28T22:08:03+00:00,"UCLA topped Colorado 28-16 at the Rose Bowl in Deion Sanders and Chip Kelly's only Pac-12 matchup.

The Bruins improved to 6-2, clinching bowl eligibility and keeping them alive in the Pac-12 race with a 3-2 league mark.

In his third start of the season, Bruins' QB Ethan Garbers passed for 269 yards and two touchdowns. He and Collin Schlee combined for two interceptions in UCLA's first-half turnover-fest. It had four, including two fumbles by Carson Steele. Luckily for Kelly, his team fixed the issue and did not have any turnovers in the second-half.

Colorado, on the other hand, could not figure out how to protect QB Shedeur Sanders, who tossed for 217 yards and one touchdown. He was sacked seven times, tying a season-high.

It didn't help that the Colorado running game was absent in the second half. Sanders handed the ball off only four times through the final two quarters, with the first one coming halfway into the final frame; the Buffaloes scored their only touchdown on that drive. They finished with 38 rushing yards, the lowest in a game this season.

Safety Shilo Sanders missed much of the game after being ejected late in the first half for targeting, but Travis Hunter shined in his second game back on the field after injury. He recorded the game's two picks.

Colorado's quest for bowl eligibility continues after dropping to 4-4. Two of the Buffs' final four opponents -- Oregon State and Utah, are ranked.

sports,Michael Benson,2023-11-15T20:00:00+00:00,"Being knocked out by your opponent is always a danger in boxing – but imagine being taken out by the referee, a TV camera or a furious ringside viewer brandishing a high-heel shoe.

Well, the fighters involved in talkSPORT’s top ten craziest fight endings in boxing did not have to imagine it because it genuinely happened to some of them.

7 Mike Tyson vs Evander Holyfield had one of the strangest endings to a fight Credit: getty

To be clear, we’re not counting fights that finish in a terrible judges’ decision or with Tyson Fury crooning in his surprisingly melodic singing voice.

For better or worse, those are common events in boxing. These ten-fight finales were a little more outlandish...

10. Mayweather turns streetfighter

Floyd Mayweather’s last KO against an actual boxer (no offence, Conor McGregor/Deji) was the most bizarre finishing sequence of his 50-bout pro career. Victor Ortiz blatantly headbutted ‘Money’ in 2011, got docked a point, then wanted to apologise by hugging it out.

However, an angry Mayweather was having none of it and landed two cracking hooks while Ortiz had his hands by his side, knocking him out.

The ending sparked an argument between Mayweather and HBO analyst Larry Merchant, which ended with the 80-year-old proclaiming his desire to kick Floyd’s ass.

Not how anyone predicted this evening would end.

7 Mayweather was headbutted by Ortiz, and so then knocked him out when he failed to protect himself Credit: Getty

9. ‘The Hitman’ and the dad

Ricky Hatton was doing a number on Stephen Smith in his 30th fight when his elbow caught Smith and opened a cut.

It looked like an accident, but not to Smith’s dad and cornerman, Darkie, who piled into the ring when his son went down and began shoving referee Mickey Vann.

A disqualification followed, and considering it was in front of 15,000 fans in Manchester, the Smiths did well to make it back to the dressing room, just being pelted with cups filled with (hopefully) beer.

“Boxing used to be a clean and fair sport; it isn't any more,"" moaned Darkie.

7 Hatton had an eventful night in 2002 Credit: Getty

8. Hopkins KOd by referee

Unsurprisingly, middleweight champ Bernard Hopkins was involved in an ugly, mauling fight against Robert Allen in 1998.

But referee Mills Lane’s attempt to physically pull the clinching pair apart went badly wrong when he sent an off-balance Hopkins through the ropes and onto the floor.

Maybe you just should have shouted ‘break’, Mills. It was a nasty spill, and Hopkins, lying ringside, claimed he was too injured to fight on.

B-Hops joked he would ‘sharpen my wrestling skills’ for the rematch a year later, but this time, he knocked out Allen in round seven.

7 The duo got to fight again in 2004

7. KO in one second

Efe Ajagba completed boxing in 2018, the then 5-0 heavyweight prospect beating Curtis Harper in the first second of round one.

He didn’t even need to throw a punch as Harper waited for the opening bell, then calmly stepped between the ropes and strolled back to his dressing room.

A baffled Ajagba celebrated his “win”, while Harper later explained he was upset over a contract situation. You wonder why he bothered with the ring walk and referee’s instructions.

But still, Ajagba got to 6-0 with an official KO1, 0:01. Harper has not fought since.

6. Big Daddy goes WWE

How can a fight end with your opponent’s manager dragging you over the top rope and out of the ring, only to finish up with you disqualified? Ask Elijah Tillery.

The heavyweight fought future world champ Riddick ‘Big Daddy’ Bowe in a bad-tempered bout in 1991. After the bell ended round one, Bowe landed a late jab in response to Tillery blowing him a kiss.

Tillery began kicking Bowe, and the pair brawled until Riddick’s fiery manager, Rock Newman, leaned in from outside and hauled Tillery out of the ring via a crude WWE neckbreaker.

Amid the chaos, the ref decided that Tillery’s kicks were worthy of a DQ and called the insanity off.

5. Kermit the Frog

Kermit Cintron had a pretty good career, crowned by a short stint as a welterweight world champion. Unfortunately, most boxing fans mainly recall him for just one thing: the unusual ending to his 2004 fight with Paul ‘The Punisher’ Williams.

The two got tangled up in round four, and while Williams fell to the canvas, Cintron dived head-first between the ropes and crashed into a table before hitting the floor. Pure momentum or oddly deliberate?

Either way, when the Puerto Rican could not continue, the bout went to the scorecards, Williams winning while Cintron was carted away on a stretcher in a neck brace.

7 Bowe was a fearsome heavyweight Credit: Getty Images - Getty

4. TV camera stoppage

It may not have changed the end result, but Adolpho Washington can forever hold a grudge against ringside TV cameras. His 175lb world title challenge against Virgil Hill in 1993 ended when he went to sit down in his corner at the end of round 11, only for his swollen eye to hit an intrusive camera, causing a cut to open up.

The gash was so bad that the fight was called off, Hill declared a technical decision winner, and Washington denied the chance to go all-out in round 12. Chances are Hill was winning anyway, but stoppage via aggressive TV camera is surely unique in boxing history.

3. McCall’s tearful breakdown

A hotly anticipated heavyweight world title fight, Lennox Lewis’ attempt to avenge his upset defeat by Oliver McCall ended in a very different kind of ‘upset’ (the one where one boxer starts crying, stops throwing punches and eventually gets stopped for simply not trying).

Iron-chinned McCall battled drug addiction in the buildup to this 1997 bout and was arrested for throwing a Christmas tree across a hotel lobby.

So McCall was clearly not in the right mindset to trade leather with Lewis, as it showed when he began wandering around the ring in a world of his own.

Ref Mills Lane eventually just waved the bizarre spectacle off.

7 McCall kept wandering off midway through the fight Credit: Getty Images - Getty

2. Mrs Wilson’s shoe

British light-heavyweights Steve McCarthy and Tony Wilson met in 1989, with McCarthy scoring a third-round knockdown

and then looking to finish the fight.

As the pair exchanged haymakers, an even more dangerous combatant entered the ring: Wilson’s 62-year-old mother in a floral dress, who began whacking McCarthy with her shoe.

McCarthy celebrated his apparent victory, but strangely, this was not over. Referee Adrian Morgan insisted the fight must continue, and McCarthy refused, citing his head wound from the shoe (which would later require stitches).

Wilson was, therefore, declared the winner – via a massive assist from his mother.

1. The bite fight

It is the most infamous ending in boxing history.

Bites in fights are not unknown, but the planet’s most famous heavyweight – Mike Tyson – biting a chunk out of Evander Holyfield’s ear, leaving him jumping around the ring in agony, in their 1997 rematch was something else. Not least because referee Mills Lane (why always him?) actually allowed it to continue.

However, when a second nibble on Evander’s other ear was spotted, Tyson was thrown out. At which point, he began violently trying to get across the crowded ring to Holyfield.

‘Iron Mike’ was fined $3 million and banned for 15 months, though he and Evander quickly made up and remain firm friends to this day – perhaps the weirdest outcome of all.","Top ten craziest fight endings in boxing history – Floyd Mayweather’s ruthless KO, Mike Tyson’s bite and a baffled Lennox Lewis",https://talksport.com/sport/1249277/top-ten-craziest-fight-endings-boxing-floyd-mayweather-mike-tyson-lennox-lewis/,TalkSport

First, the U.S. will take on Germany in Hartford, Connecticut on October 14. The 15th-ranked Germans are under new management, so the USMNT will serve as the debut match for new head coach Julian Nagelsmann, the 36-year-old who has been out of a job since departing Bayern Munich back in March.

Most European countries are busy with Euro 2024 qualifying, but the Germans are hosting the tournament and therefore qualify automatically, opening up their schedule for this friendly match.

Then, on October 17, the U.S. will travel to GEODIS Park in Nashville, Tennessee for a friendly against Ghana. The two nations have a deep history of contentious matchups, including in three consecutive World Cup tournaments in 2006, 2010, and 2014.

Below is the official 23-man roster for the upcoming October friendlies against Germany and Ghana.

PSV midfielder Malik Tillman was forced to withdraw from the squad due to injury, with Alex Zendejas of Club America named to the roster in his place.

Tyler Adams, Antonee Robinson injured for October camp

Gregg Berhalter largely has the entire first-choice player pool available for selection, with only a few injuries to work around.

There is one notable absence, as captain Tyler Adams remains sidelined with a frustrating long-term hamstring injury. He was initially injured while playing for Leeds United back in March, and while he had finally recovered to make his Bournemouth debut in the EFL Cup in late September, he played just 20 minutes off the bench before suffering a setback, sidelined again for the foreseeable future.

Gio Reyna has returned from his leg fracture and is called in for the first time under Berhalter since their falling out at the 2022 World Cup. Also included is defender Cameron Carter-Vickers who only just made his debut for Celtic this season thanks to a hamstring injury. On the heels of that return just before the international break, he is called in.

Goalkeepers Zack Steffen and Sean Johnson remain out of action due to injuries. Additionally, Josh Sargent is sidelined with a long-term ankle injury, while Daryl Dike is also out after tearing his Achilles. Also missing is Antonee Robinson, who Gregg Berhalter said is dealing with a sports hernia, and while he played through it last camp and recently for his club, it's affecting him and therefore rest is the best option here.

Johnny Cardoso had to pull out of the September camp due to an ankle injury, but he has returned to action with Brazilian club Internacional, indicating a return to fitness, and has been included on the squad.

With Adams injured, there has been some noise on social media calling for Heidenheim midfielder Lennard Maloney to be brought into the squad in October, and he was given the call-up here. The 23-year-old was born in Berlin to an American father, appearing for the U.S. at the U-20 level in the past and stating his desire to reach the USMNT senior squad.

Gio Reyna to make USMNT return under Gregg Berhalter

The ability of Berhalter and Reyna to work together moving forward has been a major talking point since the fallout of their saga after the 2022 World Cup.

Reyna's lack of playing time at the World Cup was exacerbated by the actions of his parents in the weeks that followed, which sparked a domestic violence investigation of Berhalter before his eventual re-hire as national team head coach.

Now, having recovered from a leg fracture suffered in summer Nations League duty under an interim USMNT head coach, the 20-year-old Borussia Dortmund playmaker returns to the international fold under Berhalter for the first time.

The USMNT head coach has been forthcoming about the situation, admitting upon his re-hire that the two have a ""lot of work to do"" but insisting time was needed to broach the situation. With Berhalter having since confirmed the two have broken the ice and talked over the phone, they will now look to move forward without any more personal conflict.

After the October roster release, Berhalter confirmed that the two spoke ""weeks ago"" on Zoom, with the U.S. head coach appreciative of Reyna's willingness to move forward. He spoke that because Reyna has not yet played for his club this season, their goal will be to ""get him minutes"" so he can build his fitness and return to Dortmund in the best position possible to begin his club campaign.

Berhalter stated that they see Reyna being able to play three different positions: central midfielder, attacking midfielder, and winger, with further clarification being his skill-set fitting a ""between the lines"" style of wide play if he were deployed on the wing, as opposed to one glued to the touchline.","USA squad for October friendlies 2023: USMNT roster for friendly matches vs Germany, Ghana",https://www.sportingnews.com/us/soccer/news/usa-squad-october-friendlies-usmnt-roster-germany-ghana/5b2416befc50de6d0cedace8,Sporting News

A 3-2 win in the second leg at BMO Field in Toronto allowed Jamaica to progress on away goals after a 4-4 aggregate tie across the two legs.

After Canada opened the scoring through Alphonso Davies they held a comfortable 3-1 aggregate lead, but that advantage eroded in 15 second-half minutes as Jamaican striker Shamar Nicholson scored a brace, before Fulham attacker Bobby De Cordova-Reid converted the penalty that sealed progression.

Kickoff: 7:30 p.m. local (7:30 p.m ET / 4:30 p.m. PT)

Location: BMO Field (Toronto, Canada)

Referee: Cesar Ramos (MEX)

Starting lineups:

Canada (4-4-2): Borjan - Laryea, Miller, Cornelius, Johnston (Millar 84') - Davies, Eustaquio (Russell-Rowe 89'), Kone (Kaye 74'), Buchanan (Hoilett 74') - Larin (Osorio 74'), David

Jamaica (4-2-3-1): Blake - Leigh (Gray 94'), Pinnock, Lowe, Lembikisa - Johnson, Latibeaudiere (Hector 46') - Bailey (Bernard 90'), Nicholson, De Cordova-Reid - Gray

It looked like it was going to be a comfortable night for Canada when Davies opened the scoring on 25 minutes after a lung-bursting run. The Bayern star saw his shot saved onto the crossbar before the ball spun in on the goal line.

This gave Canada a 3-1 aggregate lead and if it wasn't for Jamaican stopper Andre Blake, there could have easily been a couple more goals, making two great saves from Cyle Larin prior to Davies' opener.

However, the home side couldn't get the second goal and Jamaica grew in confidence, particularly after half-time.

In three second-half minutes, the tie was blown apart by two goals from Shamar Nicholson. A Canadian mistake handed the first to him on a plate before Demarai Gray's individual brilliance set up the second for a tap-in.

With the scoreline 2-1 on the night, the match was destined for extra time and penalties with a 3-3 aggregate.

But Jamaica could barely contemplate possible glory before Ismael Kone's header made it 2-2 on the night and gave Canada a single-goal aggregate advantage.

It appeared as if Canada had weathered the storm until first-leg hero Stephen Eustaquio's handball in the box allowed De Cordova-Reid to score the winning penalty with 12 minutes of regulation to play.

Jamaica managed to hold on through nine minutes of stoppage time, despite Gray being given a second yellow card for dissent on 84 minutes.

Canada vs Jamaica live updates, highlights, commentary

Fulltime: Canada 2-3 Jamaica, 4-4 aggregate

Jamaica's first-ever win on Canadian soil sees them advance by away goals to the CONCACAF Nations League semi-final and Copa America 2024. Extraordinary.

95 mins: Canada 2-3 Jamaica, 4-4 aggregate

Canada doing all the attacking but the Jamaican defence is well-organised. Hoilett blasts a shot well over the bar from outside the box.

90 mins: Canada 2-3 Jamaica, 4-4 aggregate

There will be nine minutes of added-on time. As it stands Jamaica are through on away goals. What a result this could be.

88 mins: Canada 2-3 Jamaica, 4-4 aggregate

Canada are dominating with their man advantage. David gets a free header in the six-yard box but it balloons over the bar. That was a decent chance.

84 mins: RED CARD (Demarai Gray) Canada 2-3 Jamaica, 4-4 aggregate

What a brain-fade by Jamaica's Gray. He gets two yellow cards in a minute and is dismissed. He booted the ball away for no reason. Clear second yellow card. Can they hold on now?

83 mins: Canada 2-3 Jamaica, 4-4 aggregate

What an incredible result this would be for Jamaica. Especially when Canada were cruising with a 3-1 aggregate lead until the 62nd minute.

78 mins: GOAL - Canada 2-3 Jamaica (Bobby De Cordova-Reid), 4-4 aggregate

Jamaica are going through as it stands on away goals. The Fulham attacker converts from the spot after a handball from Eustaquio and they are back in front on the night.

74 mins: Canada 2-2 Jamaica, 4-3 aggregate

Triple change for Canada. Junior Hoilett, Jonathan Osorio and Mark Kaye come on for Cyle Larin, Ismael Larin and Tajon Buchanan.

69 mins: GOAL - Canada 2-2 (Ismael Kone), 4-3 aggregate

Canada strike back. What an absolute rollercoaster. Davies floats in a deft cross and Kone's redirects it over Blake to send the crowd wild. Canada progressing on aggregate as we stand. It's on Jamaica now.

66 mins: GOAL - Canada 1-2 (Shamar Nicholson), 3-3 aggregate

WOW. Jamaica have hit the front and we are even on aggregate. What a counter-attack. Gray sprung clear down the left and his ball was prodded in by Nicholson. Incredible turnaround. As it stands, extra time is on the table.

62 mins: GOAL - Canada 1-1 Jamaica (Shamar Nicholson), 3-2 aggregate

THEY ARE BACK! Lowe takes the ball away from the Canadian defender. He feeds Nicholson in the box and the big striker smashes the ball home. We have a game now.

57 mins: Canada 1-0 Jamaica, 3-1 aggregate

The match has settled significantly after an early onslaught from Jamaica. They seem to be deflated by missing the chance to equalise this leg. They need to find something.

52 mins: Canada 1-0 Jamaica, 3-1 aggregate

Been a great start to the half by Jamaica. Constant pressure. Bailey looks dangerous. Canada needs to ride this storm.

48 mins: Canada 1-0 Jamaica, 3-1 aggregate

Bailey strikes the crossbar. The Aston Villa winger's shot hits the underside of the bar, bounces on the line and is cleared. Jamaica appeal in vain that the ball crossed the line. Ridiculously close to an equaliser.

Second half: Canada 1-0 Jamaica, 3-1 aggregate

We are underway in the second period. Can Jamaica strike early or will it be a Canadian cruise?

Halftime: Canada 1-0 Jamaica, 3-1 aggregate

It's been relatively smooth sailing for the Canadians with a single goal giving them a two-goal aggregate advantage. It could have been more goals if it wasn't for the heroics of Andre Blake. Jamaica are going to need a miracle in the second half. One goal could make the home side nervous.

45 mins: Canada 1-0 Jamaica, 3-1 aggregate

Two minutes of time added on.

45 mins: Canada 1-0 Jamaica, 3-1 aggregate

Wow. Oh so close for Jamaica. Gray cuts in from the left. Delivers a delicious ball through the six-yard box but Nicholson can't quite get his head on the ball. Inches away from connection there.

43 mins: Canada 1-0 Jamaica, 3-1 aggregate

Jamaica need to get to half-time. A second goal from Canada would end this tie. Davies threatens down the left once again but is flagged for offside.

37 mins: Canada 1-0 Jamaica, 3-1 aggregate

Eustaquiao swings the free kick into the back post and Miller just can't get his head to it. That was nearly a perfect delivery. It feels like a second goal is coming.

35 mins: Canada 1-0 Jamaica, 3-1 aggregate

Canada look dangerous on the break. Davies breaks down the left. He drills a low ball through the penalty box but it deflects off a defender's legs and bounces to safety. Jamaica have to be wary or this match will be over shortly.

31 mins: Canada 1-0 Jamaica, 3-1 aggregate

Gray plays the ball across the six-yard box, Bailey stabs the ball on goal but it's straight into the arms of Borjan. Jamaica's best chance so far.

29 mins: Canada 1-0 Jamaica, 3-1 aggregate

Nicholson finds himself through on goal for Jamaica after the lofted pass but he can only spoon a shot well wide. In any case, the offside flag is raised once the play is over.

25 mins: GOAL - Canada 1-0 Jamaica (Alphonso Davies), 3-1 aggregate

And there it is. Canada take the lead through Alphonso Davies. The Bayern star initially sprays the ball out wide to David, who plays an inch-perfect pass to Davies in the six-yard box. Blake blocked Davies' goal-bound effort but it looped up, hit the crossbar and then spun in, with Larin making sure he didn't touch the ball in case he was offside.

21 mins: Canada 0-0 Jamaica, 2-1 aggregate

Still goalless here at BMO Field. Canada look the more dangerous team with Jamaica threatening sporadically.

15 mins: Canada 0-0 Jamaica, 2-1 aggregate

Another save from Blake. This one might be the pick of the bunch. David pokes the ball to Larin in the six-yard box, but his low shot hits the body of Blake, who is in the right position once again. Only looks like a matter of time until Canada open the scoring.

12 mins: Canada 0-0 Jamaica, 2-1 aggregate

Buchanan plays a lovely ball over the top to Larin. The Canadian striker is through on goal. He muscles his way through but the shot is saved by Blake. Belatedly, the assistant referee raises his flag for offside on Larin's initial run.

9 mins: Canada 0-0 Jamaica, 2-1 aggregate

What a save from Andre Blake. Keeps Jamaica in touch in the tie. Buchanan played an enticing ball across the six-yard box, Lowe made a good connection with the slide at the back post but Blake got his body in the way. Impressive block.

7 mins: Canada 0-0 Jamaica, 2-1 aggregate

Johnson sends in a deep free kick for Jamaica but it's cleared for a corner. The first of the match. Johnson takes the corner but it's poorly delivered and Canada eventually clear.

4 mins: Canada 0-0 Jamaica, 2-1 aggregate

The home side has started confidently on the ball. It's going to be a tough task for Jamaica. They have never beaten Canada on the road.

Kickoff: Canada 0-0 Jamaica, 2-1 aggregate

We are off and running at BMO Field, Toronto. It's a cold, wet, windy night here.

Canada vs Jamaica projected lineups & team news

Canada interim head coach Mauro Biello deployed a 4-4-2 against Jamaica in the first leg on the road, but expect him to bring back their more-utilized three-defender system. That would allow them to rotate Kamal Miller out, who picked up a yellow card in the first leg, keeping him safe for the semifinals.

In would step Alistair Johnston and Derek Cornelius, with Steven Vitoria retained alongside them.

The only injury absence for Canada at the moment is striker Lucas Cavallini, who withdrew from the squad prior to the two matches, replaced by Jacen Russell-Rowe.

Canada projected starting lineup (3-5-2): Borjan (GK) — Cornelius, Vitoria, Johnston — Laryea, Eustaquio, Kone, Kaye, Davies — David, Larin.

Jamaica saw star striker Michail Antonio go down with a gutting ACL injury in the first leg, and he now begins a lengthy rehab process. West Ham are reportedly furious about how it was handled, angered by both the conditions of the pitch in Jamaica and the fact he played another 10 minutes after sustaining the injury.

Antonio was replaced by Salernitana striker Trivante Stewart, but he struggled and was himself withdrawn in the 81st minute. Demarai Gray could step in, but he himself is struggling for fitness, and while he remains with the team he was not part of the first leg matchday squad. Another option is Colorado Switchbacks forward Romario Williams, who scored 15 goals in 29 USL Championship matches this season.

Other injuries for Jamaica to contend with include Cory Burke and Amari'i Bell, who both miss out on this international window.

Jamaica projected starting lineup (4-3-3): Blake (GK) — Leigh, Bernard, Pinnock, Lembikisa — Latibeaudiere, D. Johnson, Bailey — Reid, Nicholson, R. Williams.

sports,The Roar,2023-10-26T21:11:37+00:00,"Chris Goulding has fired off a season-high seven three-pointers to steer NBL ladder leaders Melbourne United to a 96-84 win over the Illawarra Hawks.

Operating without injured guards Ian Clark (hamstring) and Matthew Dellavedova (concussion) on Sunday, Melbourne suffered a first-half scare when Luke Travers was forced off after a knock to his left knee.

It came as visitors Illawarra surged as much as 10 points clear during a high-scoring first half at John Cain Arena.

But United captain Goulding’s hot hand kept his team in the contest as he drained 21 first-half points, including five three-pointers.

Goulding finished with 33 points including seven triples – more than any other player in a game this season – as United’s tough defence in the second half carried them home.

Shea Ili (17 points) and Tanner Krebs (14) also reached double figures for Melbourne.

The result extended United’s winning streak to six games, giving them an 8-1 record on top of the ladder.

Import forward Gary Clark (24 points) and Justin Robinson (20) tried to give Illawarra a lift but Tyler Harvey managed just 10 points, three days after his clutch three-pointer sealed a thrilling win over Cairns.

In a sloppy start, United committed five turnovers in the first period and trailed at quarter-time for the first time this season.

Clark’s eight points on perfect shooting led Illawarra to a 29-24 advantage at that point.

His tally swelled to 16 by the main break and the Hawks’ lead reached double figures soon after United temporarily lost Travers to injury.

But Goulding caught fire to lead United to a 52-51 at the main break.

Defence was key in the second half as both sides tightened up, with Melbourne holding the visitors to just 15 points in the final period.

Travers returned after half-time, finishing with six points and a game-high 11 rebounds.

Ariel Hukporti retained his spot in Melbourne’s starting five ahead of Jo Lual-Acuil Jr and impressed with seven points and 10 rebounds, including four on the offensive end.

Bullets ride late luck to win over Tasmania

Nathan Sobey has peeled off a game-high 28 points as Brisbane survived a late Tasmania fightback to continue their NBL resurgence with a tense 90-87 win.

Despite being without star big Aron Baynes (suspended) and import guard Shannon Scott (hamstring), the Bullets soared to a second straight victory on Sunday and snapped a quirky streak in the process.

It was their first win after seven straight losses in Sunday fixtures, in a run that dates back to last season.

Far more importantly, the result levelled Brisbane’s current season record at 4-4 after five rounds.

But it didn’t come easily as fourth-quarter specialists Tasmania trimmed a seven-point deficit back to a single point when Majok Deng drove to the rack with 34 seconds remaining.

The two sides traded blows in the dying stages and the JackJumpers almost sent the game to overtime when they pinched Sam McDaniel’s inbounds pass on the final play.

Jack McVeigh got a hand in to force the turnover and Tasmania found Jordon Crawford, but his decent look at an attempted game-leveller rimmed out.

The JackJumpers, who trailed by seven at three-quarter time, kept alive their record of winning every fourth term this season, but it wasn’t enough.

Brisbane captain Sobey led from the front as defensive specialist Mitch Norton kept Tasmania’s import Crawford (16 points) relatively quiet until the final period.

Tyrrell Harrison and Josh Bannan (10 points each) were important for the Bullets, while Chris Smith (11) and Isaac White (10) gave solid contributions off the bench.

The gut-wrenching loss ended a horror round five for the JackJumpers, who lost at home to Melbourne United before going down to the Bullets.

It left them with a 4-4 record after a strong 4-2 start to the season.

McVeigh (18 points) and Deng (17) gave strong offensive contributions for Tasmania, who lost Marcus Lee for the final few minutes after the starting centre fouled out.

Taipans import injured in win over Kings

A nasty back injury to first-year import sensation Patrick Miller has marred the Taipans’ otherwise impressive 87-80 win over Sydney at the Cairns Convention Centre.

Miller, who entered Saturday night’s clash ranked second in the NBL in scoring and fourth in assists, had the hosts in control before an explosive drive to the bucket ended with him crashing to the floor, 1:09 out from halftime.

The American’s head whip-lashed onto the floor before he got up gingerly and walked slowly to the bench holding his lower back, unable to continue.

Stepping up were acting skipper Bul Kuol (24, played all 40 minutes) and big Sam Waardenburg (22) for the Snakes, who shrugged off last Thursday’s buzzer-beating heartbreak in Illawarra by taking the NBL’s most prized scalp.

It shot them from fifth to third on the ladder, while sending the Kings slumping from second to fourth.

“We kept moving down the bench to bring guys in,” Cairns coach Adam Forde said. “Everyone responded.

“I’m super happy for the group that they could fill some short-term reward with a win at home.”

Ex-Taipan Kouat Noi (18 points) top-scored for the visitors, while Jaylen Adams (13) and DJ Hogg (13) – playing against his former side in his long-awaited debut for his new team following a shoulder injury – got on the scoresheet, but both shot under 30 per cent, embodying the Kings’ rocky evening.

The two-time reigning champions were all at sea early, out-rebounded 18-6 in the opening term while missing their first 15 three-pointers.

Cairns boosted their 26-20 quarter-time buffer to 12 points shortly before Miller’s night ended in stomach-churning style.

The injury left their backcourt stocks further depleted, with Taran Armstrong (foot) and captain Tahjere McCall (family reasons) already missing.

Without Miller running the point, the home side’s offence suddenly looked shaky in the third term as Sydney briefly took the lead on a Hogg triple.

The undermanned Taipans responded with a 15-0 burst either side of three-quarter time, highlighted by Swedish young gun Bobi Klintman’s thunderous dunk down the middle over rival Next Star Alex Toohey.

Down by 14, Sydney closed the gap to four points before unsportsmanlike fouls against Denzel Valentine and Makuach Maluach ended their revival.

Lamenting “the defensive mistakes that we made”, Kings coach Mahmoud Abdelfattah added: “They made more plays than we did, they got to the 50/50 balls and they stuck together.

“Kudos to them, they deserved it.”

Phoenix hold off fast-finishing Breakers

South East Melbourne Phoenix have survived a massive late scare to clinch a tense 103-100 victory over the fast-finishing New Zealand Breakers at John Cain Arena.

The Phoenix were eyeing off a percentage pile-on when they led by a whopping 26 points on Saturday before the bottom-placed, injury-hit Breakers produced a brave rearguard to almost pinch a miracle.

The Phoenix’s big four – Alan Williams (21 points, 13 rebounds), Mitch Creek (20 points), Gary Browne (18 points, eight assists) and Will Cummings (16 points, all in the first half) – led the way but the final stages got too close for comfort.

Electrifying American point guard Parker Jackson-Cartwright (33 points, eight assists) and Finn Delany (21 points) were instrumental in the 32-19 fourth-quarter fightback from the Breakers, who were brave despite succumbing to their fourth successive defeat.

“We were one lucky bounce away from winning this game,” NZ coach Mody Maor said. “Our guys are doing everything they can and everything I ask of them everyday. “They are working as hard as can be. Our fans should be proud of the level of effort our guys put in.”

They were without import power forward Zylan Cheatham, who suffered a broken foot in last Thursday’s loss to Adelaide, and Williams duly proved a beast in the low block against the undersized Anthony Lamb.

Behind Williams’ dominance and Browne’s ball-handling and playmaking wizardry, the Phoenix pulled ahead 31-21 at quarter-time.

Cummings scored at will in the second stanza before Creek inspired a 16-0 third-quarter burst for the home side, whose advantage swelled to 80-54.

NZ reverted to a zone defence and centre Mangok Mathiang impacted at both ends as the Breakers went 17-2 either side of three-quarter-time to haul themselves back into the contest.

Quicksilver Cartwright-Jackson poured in 10 points inside three minutes to reduce the margin to three points down the stretch before Williams’ hook and Browne’s free throw iced it narrowly.

“It was frustrating to see the lead dwindle,” Phoenix coach Mike Kelly said. “But it’s a win. The guys are going in the right direction. “I’m not disappointed, I’m stoked.”

Bullets shoot down weakened Wildcats

Advertisement

The Brisbane Bullets have shrugged off the absence of two important players to outwork the Wildcats at their home RAC Arena in Perth and produce a performance full of heart for their 84-79 NBL win.

Both teams were 2-4 coming into Friday’s match and on losing slides, but it was the Wildcats who had the pressure building, even with the Bullets being without key pair, the suspended Aron Baynes and injured Shannon Scott.

Brisbane scored the first seven points before opening up a 20-point lead in the third quarter and going on to win by five after holding out against a furious late charge from the home team.

The team effort of the Bullets was outstanding as they got another 17 points from captain Nathan Sobey.

Chris Smith put up 16 points, Josh Bannan 15 and Tyrell Harrison 12 to go with five rebounds and three blocks in just 14 minutes.

First-year Bullets coach Justin Schueller couldn’t have been prouder of his team.

“It was a big game for us having dropped four, with two marquees out and we knew we had to come in here and play near a perfect game,” he said.

“My initial thought is just pleasure in how the guys stuck to a plan, and found our advantages consistently throughout the night.”

The Wildcats missed 18 of their first 19 three-point attempts before making a couple midway through the last quarter from Keanu Pinder, who finished with 22 points and five rebounds.

He was a lone shining light for a Wildcats team, who have lost four straight. Again, superstar Bryce Cotton struggled to 10 points and five assists on 3-of-19 shooting.

“My words during the week were that we’re just not playing good, that showed again tonight,” Perth coach John Rillie said.

“Our offence isn’t functioning very good right now. We’re doing a great job holding teams to scores where we could put enough points on the board to win, in saying that we’re not doing that.

“That’s certainly something we have to address and resolve here pretty quickly.”

Advertisement

Brisbane, who were on a four-game losing streak, started with the game’s first seven points and were still leading 20-9 by the end of the first quarter.

While the Wildcats had their moments in the second quarter, Brisbane did well to lead 42-36 at the long break.

It was 17-year-old Rocco Zikarsky who stood tall in the paint in the third quarter with Harrison in foul trouble.

Sobey and Smith then knocked down shots as the Bullets lead ballooned to 20.

The Wildcats did make a charge with a Pinder-inspired 11-0 run in the fourth to cut the deficit to three, but the Bullets answered with strong inside finishes from Harrison and Bannan to secure the win.

United flex muscles in road win over JackJumpers

Melbourne United have had to withstand a hot start and finish from the Tasmania JackJumpers but in between were outstanding on the way to a 90-82 victory in the NBL.

Advertisement

The league’s top two teams locked horns at a sold out MyState Bank Arena on Friday night and it was the JackJumpers who raced out of the blocks with a 17-4 start, but United took control from there.

Melbourne led by as many as 16 points midway through the fourth quarter on the back of a three ball from Luke Travers (14 points, 13 rebounds), having outscored the JackJumpers by 78 points to 49 after the first five minutes.

The JackJumpers pulled off a remarkable comeback on Melbourne back in round two and got as close as four points in the final minute, but United held firm for a fifth straight win to stay on top at 7-1.

Dean Vickerman was celebrating his 300th game coaching in the NBL, and the Melbourne boss was full of praise for his team.

“Tonight was a little bit like my career,” he said.

“We didn’t start great but once we found our rhythm and especially the way we came out of the half and had a great third quarter, and held on down a few players at the end there. But we held on.”

NBA and NBL champion Ian Clark top-scored with 19 points, with rookie Kyle Bowen adding a career-best 17 as did Jo Lual-Acuil along with 10 rebounds.

Advertisement

Jack McVeigh led the way for Tasmania with 20 points and seven rebounds, with Jordon Crawford contributing 16 points and four assists, and Milton Doyle 12 points and five assists.

Tasmania coach Scott Roth was philosophical afterwards, having given up 18 offensive rebounds and lost the battle on the glass by 16.

“We got a little uncharacteristic with our shot selection, which was a credit to them,” he said.

“Then they beat us up on the glass. It’s just little things when you get in those kind of games that are going to make the separation points.”

The JackJumpers opened up on fire, racing to a 17-4 lead inside the opening five minutes including three balls to Crawford and McVeigh, but United soon steadied and it was the introduction of Lual-Acuil that inspired it.

Melbourne would close the quarter outscoring Tasmania 17 points to four before three-pointers midway through the second stanza from Bowen and Clark put them up five.

Advertisement

United were still leading 43-42 at halftime, on the back of 11 extra rebounds and 10 second-chance points, before captain Chris Goulding opened his account at the start of the second half from downtown.

Clark hit his second long ball of the game soon after to push Melbourne’s lead out to nine, his third stretched it to double-figures and Bowen landed two surprise ones of his own.

The United lead grew to 16 before the JackJumpers showed their trademark fight with a 14-2 run – but they couldn’t quite complete the job.

Harvey’s Hawks buzzer beater sinks Taipans

Illawarra Hawks import Tyler Harvey has sealed an 84-83 upset defeat of the Cairns Taipans with a clutch three-pointer in the final seconds at WIN Entertainment Centre.

Staring down the possibility of a 1-5 start to the NBL season, last year’s wooden spooners looked intent on staging an ambush on Thursday night as captain Sam Froling fired early.

But the Taipans chased down a 13-point lead and edged in front in the final quarter, with Patrick Miller (24 points, seven assists) leading the charge.

Miller’s jump shot in the final 10 seconds gave the Taipans a two-point lead that looked as though it could have been match-winning.

But the Hawks belted down the court and the ball found itself in Harvey’s hands for their final roll of the dice.

His deep three swished through the net with one second remaining, sending the home crowd into raptures and improving the Hawks to 2-4.

“I turned around to my assistants and I said, ‘That’s why we have him (Harvey)’,” said Hawks coach Jacob Jackomas.

“It’s good that people can be reminded how special he is at the end of the clock.

“In that space, he always gives us a chance.”

The Taipans are now 2-2 to start the season, having also dropped their two games against NBA sides as part of that league’s pre-season.

Advertisement

“It’s a tall order to expect us to win if we keep giving up second-chance points,” said Taipans coach Adam Forde.

“I don’t want to discredit Illawarra (but) during the game, I felt like we were better-equipped to close it out, but we didn’t and Illawarra did. It’s the one that got away.”

Nine first-quarter points from Froling helped the Hawks to a nine-point lead at the first change.

Froling (16 points, 13 rebounds) had his double-double with seven minutes remaining in the third quarter.

But Cairns did a better job at targeting him later on, keeping the rangy centre scoreless in the second half.

“He had a great game,” Jackomas said.

Import Justin Robinson, who had struggled from the field to begin the season, hit a three that forced a timeout and restored a game-high 13-point lead in the third quarter.

But lapses in concentration threatened to cost the Hawks.

They invited Cairns back into the game by shooting only one of their last nine attempts from the field in the third quarter, having gone almost four minutes without scoring from the field in the second.

After the break, a free-throw from Sam Waardenburg tied things up, one of nine occasions in the final quarter alone that scores were level.

It took Harvey’s moment of magic to split the sides late.

“I’m really happy for the guys,” Jackomas said.

“It is a bit of a relief, but we need to move on into being a basketball team now, not the team that’s relieved to win.

“I’m really confident in these guys.”

Cheatham injured as 36ers upset Breakers

The New Zealand Breakers face a nervous wait after losing import Zylan Cheatham to a leg injury in the 97-85 upset loss to the Adelaide 36ers.

Without a hand being laid on him, ex-NBA forward Cheatham pulled up sore changing direction early in the fourth quarter at Auckland’s Spark Arena on Thursday night.

Cheatham was unable to put weight on his right leg as Breakers staff helped him from the floor.

He played no further part in the match, but there was no immediate update on his condition after full-time.

Advertisement

“It’s too early. We’ll pray for good news,” said Breakers coach Mody Maor.

Any long-term injury would be troublesome for last season’s runners-up, who have begun the campaign with only one win from four games.

Cheatham’s injury proved a turning point. The Breakers had maintained a slim lead for most of the night as Cheatham (17 points, eight rebounds) combined with guard Will McDowell-White to strong effect.

But the Sixers went on a 10-0 run straight after the American went off, then moved in front for the first time since the opening quarter.

Sunday Dech nailed a three-pointer to give what was then the 36ers’ biggest lead of the day (seven points).

They never again trailed, clinching the final quarter 27-14.

Advertisement

“Zylan’s a focal point for us in everything that we do, he’s also one of our leaders, one of our best competitors,” Maor said.

“To see him go down like this, I think deflated us.

“New team, new people, new leaders, these are the kinds of things that we need to learn to deal with.”

The 36ers, tipped as possible wooden spooners in the pre-season, have now won three of their past four games.

Mid-season recruit Dejan Vasiljevic (24 points, five assists) took centre stage for the Sixers after Cheatham went off.

The two-time NBL champion sank his 200th three-pointer in the first half and hit three more in the fourth quarter as the Sixers broke away.

Advertisement

“He’s a tough SOB,” 36ers coach CJ Bruton said.

“When it comes down to it, from the juniors, to the seniors, to the pros, that’s who he is and he carries that. He’s got respect from everyone, not only our team, but the league.”

Sixers big man Isaac Humphries, who starred in an upset defeat of Perth last game, had been instrumental earlier on.

The centre (17 points, 11 rebounds) used his size advantage to dominate the paint and help Adelaide remain in the game, despite giving up 10 first-half turnovers as a team. They finished with a staggering 23.

The Breakers were left to rue wayward free-throw shooting (12 from 20 attempts), which meant they were never able to open up a double-digit lead.

Former Golden State Warriors forward Anthony Lamb (25 points) is acclimatising quickly to the NBL, though the Breakers recruit had too little help as he notched nine fourth-quarter points.

sports,Jonathan Liew at Old Trafford,2023-12-06T23:45:56+00:00,"Imagine what Manchester United could do if Erik ten Hag hadn’t already lost the dressing room. Yes, it’s been another of those weeks at Old Trafford: rancour, rumour and recrimination, barbs in the press and barbs at the press, defeat at Newcastle followed by this stirring recovery against Chelsea, and the startling realisation that United are now three points behind Manchester City. It’s still only Thursday, by the way.

Perhaps ultimately this win only buys Ten Hag a few days’ grace, a warm flume of goodwill that lasts only as long as it takes for Dominic Solanke to run through on goal for Bournemouth on Saturday afternoon. Back in the grip of crisis, back in the now-familiar lexicon of surly unsourced stories about dressing room discontent. Such is the way of things at football’s most reliable content provider. This beast must always eat.

But block out the noise for just a moment, as of course United cannot, and something interesting is happening here. This was a win that felt a lot tighter than it really was: United inexplicably hanging on at the end despite enjoying 28 shots and an xG tally of 4.07. For long periods United played some of their most authentically thrilling football of the season, a doctrine of relentless attack that had Diogo Dalot flying forward from right-back even as the minutes ticked down.

It was also a game that felt more chaotic than it really was. In fact the slippery, slingy nature of the play was largely by design: United hollowing out their midfield in order to throw bodies forward, Chelsea hollowing out theirs in order to leave men up for the breakaway. It was a game that hung on United’s determination to keep allowing Chelsea counterattacks, and Chelsea’s determination to keep messing them up. It was a game, above all, that hung on the curious main character energy of Scott McTominay.

United fans will no doubt note the rich irony in the fact that these days McTominay is basically doing the job they once paid Paul Pogba to do. Marauding midfield engine and late-running goal threat; the all-action superhero who can chip in with 10 goals a season and pull off slide tackles that make the highlight reels. It never quite worked out for Pogba at United, largely – if you believe his most vehement critics – on account of his hair. McTominay is a different kind of player with a different kind of skillset. But for all the undoubted leadership qualities of Bruno Fernandes and Harry Maguire, tactically it is McTominay running the show right now: a development with numerous interesting consequences.

Here he scored his fifth and sixth goals of the season. Previously he has never got more than seven. Where is this coming from? Partly from the fact that opponents have still not quite cottoned on to McTominay’s goal threat, those late runs to the far post, the blur on the edge of the 18-yard box that you don’t spot until it’s too late. But partly, too, it is a function of how Ten Hag is using him.

Unlike his previous more conventional midfield roles, these days McTominay basically has a licence to create overloads wherever he finds them. Against low blocks and structured defences – and nobody is remotely accusing Chelsea of possessing one of those – he provides the extra body in a tightly marked penalty area. But he also pops up in the channels, on the wing, either supporting the man in possession or offering himself for the quick switch of play.

Great times for a great guy. But, of course, if you commit a midfielder to this role, then you leave gaps elsewhere. One of the reasons Chelsea found it so easy to play through United was that, with the forwards pushed high and McTominay as the secret sauce in the final third, there were open spaces every time they played through the press. Chelsea’s goal was a case in point: two simple vertical passes straight through the centre via Mykhailo Mudryk to Cole Palmer, passes that McTominay could see coming but could do precious little to stop.

On another night, perhaps Chelsea score from one of these counterattacks. Perhaps in another game United come up against a better finisher than Nicolas Jackson, who for all his talent looks like a man playing football in a hall of mirrors. This is the high-wire act that Ten Hag is enacting: a daring gamble that United will gain more going forward than they lose going back.

That once Lisandro Martínez and Raphaël Varane come back, once he brings the defensive line up 10 yards, once Rasmus Højlund hits some form, once Mason Mount gets up to speed, lawless abandon will begin to resemble a sustainable attacking blueprint. That he can shout down the noise in the short term while building something in the long term. Right now, in the raptured afterglow of a big win, it feels like a gamble being won. But best to come back and check in a few days, just to make sure.",Ten Hag’s gamble pays off against Chelsea as McTominay steals show | Jonathan Liew,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/dec/06/ten-hags-gamble-pays-off-against-chelsea-as-mctominay-steals-show,The Guardian

sports,Andreas Hale,2023-09-30T23:44:09+00:00,"T-MOBILE ARENA, LAS VEGAS — Reports of Saul ""Canelo"" Alvarez's decline have been greatly exaggerated.

The reigning face of boxing made it look easy as he retained his undisputed super middleweight title by dominating Jermell Charlo.

And it wasn't even remotely close.

Charlo already had a significant mountain to climb by moving up two weight classes and leaving his undisputed super welterweight status behind for the biggest fight of his career. But there are clearly levels to the boxing game and Charlo was either unprepared or unwilling to deal with one of the best pound-for-pound fighters in the world.

Charlo delivered a listless performance as Canelo bulled his way forward and tormented his opponent's body for much of the fight, scoring a knockdown in round seven to provide the only real drama of the evening.

“I worked the whole fight on going to the body, and then I changed it up. That’s what happens when you change the punch,"" Canelo said about the knockdown.

Canelo pursued Charlo and realized very quickly that his opponent was overmatched. With Charlo spending most of the fight with his back against the ropes, Canelo rumbled forward and slugged away at the body, fired an efficient jab, and landed the occasional hook to the head.

There wasn't much that Canelo could do aside from following Charlo around and looking for an opening to land power shots. That opportunity presented itself in the seventh round when a body shot was followed by a right hand to the temple which caused Charlo to take a knee.

After that, it was a game of survival for Charlo.

With fans filtering out in the later rounds due to an insurmountable lead, Canelo appeared to become annoyed with Charlo's unwillingness to engage. The scores reflected that as Canelo won with tallies of 119-108, 118-109 & 118-109.

""Nobody can beat this Canelo,"" ""Cinco De Mayo. I'll come back and fight anybody. I don't f---ing care.""

Canelo (59-2-2, 39 KOs) successfully made his third defense of the undisputed super middleweight championship. He unified all four major titles when he knocked out Caleb Plant in November 2021.

After suffering a hiccup when he fell short in attempting to gain light heavyweight gold against Dmitry Bivol, the 33-year-old superstar has now won three fights in a row and will wait to see what's next. The obvious choice for many is a megafight with undisputed welterweight champion Terence Crawford. However, Crawford would need to move up 21 pounds for that fight to happen and he's engaged in a potential rematch with Errol Spence.

Other options appear to be David Benavidez and Jermell's older brother, Jermall Charlo.

As for Charlo, he still owns the IBF, WBA, and WBC championships and can return to the 154-pound division to defend those titles. Charlo called out Crawford, but after this performance, it is unlikely that Crawford would be interested.

Here's how it all went down in Las Vegas.

Erickson Lubin takes controversial decision over Jesus Ramos in snoozer

Scores: 115-113, 116-112 & 117-111

11:29 p.m. ET: Well, that was surprising. It felt like Ramos was in control but all three judges found a way to give Ramos the decision. Although it wasn't a great fight, it certainly didn't appear to be a close fight and it definitely wasn't one that Lubin appeared to be winning. Alas, Lubin won a fight that few will remember outside of the controversial decision.

11:16 p.m. ET: Two rounds left and this crowd is fed up with the lack of action between Ramos and Lubin. Fans are more interested in watching the celebrities walk in.

11:04 p.m. ET: Through seven rounds, Ramos has been in control in what has been a relatively tame affair with Lubin. Nothing much to write home about. Just a workman-like effort from Ramos as he continues to apply pressure while Lubin seems content to fight off of his backfoot. It's not great.

10:24 p.m. ET: Co-main event is up next as Jesus Ramos (20-0, 16 KOs) faces Erickson Lubin (25-2, 18 KOs) in a WBC/WBA super welterweight title eliminator.

Barrios claims interim WBC welterweight title with wide decision over Ugas

Scores: 117-108, 118-107 & 118-107

10:08 p.m. ET: We had some added drama down the stretch as Barrios dropped Ugas, who appeared to be on the verge of getting stopped. Ugas spit out his mouthpiece on two occasions to slow down the beating but lost a point in the process. It didn't matter as Barrios was well ahead and secured the decision and the title.

10:00 p.m. ET: The condition of Ugas' right eye continues to worsen as we head into the championship rounds. And the way that this fight is going, this could be the beginning of the end for Ugas' career if things don't turn around in the final six minutes.

9:50 p.m. ET: Things are getting interesting as we head into the ninth round. There is clear damage on Ugas' right eye, the same orbital bone that was broken by Errol Spence Jr. last year. He's fought a decent fight and appeared to have rebounded after the early knockdown but he's going to have to finish strong in order to get a decision here tonight.

9:26 p.m. ET: Barrios scored a knockdown at the end of round two to make this fight very interesting. Ugas walked into a stiff jab and hit the canvas. Although he wasn't terribly hurt, it'll be interesting to see how his punch resistance holds up over the duration of the fight.

9:00 p.m. ET: Next is Yordenis Ugas (27-5, 12 KOs) vs. Mario Barrios (27-2, 18 KOs) for the WBC interim super welterweight championship. Ugas is back in action over a year after suffering an eye injury in defeat against Errol Spence Jr. while Barrios will have his third fight at 147 pounds.

Elijah Garcia stops Armando Resendiz in eight

8:56 p.m. ET: Garcia finished the job in style. Although Resendiz was in the fight, Garcia's power punches were having more of an effect on him in the later rounds. Garcia dropped Resendiz with a body shot and a hook to the head in the eighth round. Garcia then took his time picking his spots as a huge combination forced the hand of referee Tony Weeks at the 1:26 mark to get his 16th victory. The middleweight division could use some new blood and Garcia might be the future of the division.

8:39 p.m. ET: Through six rounds, Garcia has looked excellent against Resendiz. He's winning the combination exchanges and landing the heavier shots. Resendiz is very game and trying to build momentum off of his upset win over Jarrett Hurd, but the 20-year-old Garcia is proving to be too much for him.

8:13 p.m. ET: The PPV card is kicking off with the undefeated Elijah Garcia (15-0, 12 KOs) taking on Armando Resendiz (14-1, 10 KOs) in middleweight action.

7:42 p.m. ET: The early preliminary fights are all wrapped up and we're moments away from the PPV portion of Canelo-Charlo. Early on we had knockouts from Frank Sanchez and Oleksandr Gvozdyk while Terrell Gausha won a majority decision. Scroll down for the early results but stay tuned to our live coverage.

The main card starts at 8 p.m. ET | 5 p.m. PT | 1 a.m. BST | 10 a.m. BST | 1 a.m. BST | 10 a.m. AEST.

sports,Mike DeCourcy,2023-10-14T23:41:07+00:00,"Gio Reyna looked sharp in the starting lineup for the United States men’s national team, in all the ways a young man can: his unyielding energy, his surprising eagerness to cover the whole of the midfield, the periodic flashes of skill when the opportunity presented itself, even the bleach-blond hair that allowed viewers to spot him in an instant.

There was one substantial element missing from his performance, though, in an immense friendly Saturday against Germany: being able to endure from starting to finishing.

It was kind of like that for the USMNT as a whole, as they blew an early lead and fell, 3-1, in East Hartford, Conn.

MORE: USMNT undone by errors in loss to Germany

It is quite possible this was the most challenging friendly the U.S. are likely to play between now and the 2026 World Cup here in North America, and so it was viewed by coach Gregg Berhalter as a significant opportunity to learn about his team. And what was learned, above all, was there needs to be an alternative approach to the midfield for whenever Tyler Adams is unavailable to play.

Adams is the one proven defensive midfielder — a No. 6, as they call it in soccer jargon — on the USMNT roster. He has been absent from the national team since injuring his hamstring in the spring, and it’s possible now he’ll need a second surgery to address the issue.

The decision about how to replace him in the lineup was rather simple. It always was the plan for Reyna to play roughly half this game, and the obvious choice in that circumstance, given the sometimes ridiculous controversy that developed from Reyna’s reserve role at the World Cup, was to have him start. The decision about how to replace Adams in the formation was complex — too much so to be resolved in one afternoon.

Reyna was exceptional throughout the first half: less influential than he might have been if given greater access to the ball but evincing a welcome taste for covering ground to become helpful on defense or to retrieve the ball and launch an attack. Weston McKennie was his typical self, particularly when he could connect with star winger Christian Pulisic along the left side.

Young Yunus Musah was deployed in the defensive midfield role, and it did not work. Whenever Germany were able to quell an American surge in the first half and regain possession, they plowed with ease through through the center of the park. He is elite at maintaining possession when operating as a box-to-box midfielder, and lately his club play, with Pulisic at AC Milan, has seen Musah in more of an attacking role. Even if one can argue he has the skill set to succeed at the No. 6, he did not appear comfortable transitioning on short notice.

“Tyler’s a great player. It’s not nice to talk about guys that aren't here, though,” Berhalter told reporters afterward. “I’d rather talk about the guys that are on the field.”

He didn’t, though, relative to how this group filled Adams’ huge vacancy. He was pleased to talk about the pressure the USMNT applied in the first half, including a ball played over the top of Germany’s defense to Pulisic early in the game that was stopped by an offside call both player and coach disputed, and Pulisic’s brilliant goal in the 27th minute that involved him driving to his right and blasting a curving shot while four defenders converged and ace goalkeeper Marc-Andre Ter Stegen watched it sail into the upper righthand corner.

“I think we created some problems,” Berhalter said. “And then just the threat we had a lot in the first half was really good. It put Germany on their heels at times. But to me, it’s also about controlling the tempo of the game, and that’s what we really need to learn.”

It was a victory of sorts for Reyna to play 45 minutes after he’d gone only 27 in his one club appearance this season for Borussia Dortmund. He’d been injured in June while playing for the U.S. and missed all of preseason training and nearly two months of the Bundesliga season.

“The goal is to send him back to Dortmund in a really good spot,” Berhalter said. “I think he played a good game, showed his quality. I think everyone in the first half played well. So it was good to see him, good to have him on the field.”

It was not good to not have him on the field, because the collapse from a 1-1 halftime tie not only followed Reyna’s departure, but probably was connected. The U.S. was able to threaten the opposing goal enough with Reyna on the field to cause the opposition to concern itself with defending more often than it preferred. Replacement Luca de la Torre dulled the attack and did nothing to dissuade Germany’s rampage toward the American net.

There was plenty of blame to be shared on the goals by Niclas Fullkrug in the 58th minute and Jamal Musiala three minutes later. Sergino Dest allowed the ball to deflect off his foot and into dangerous territory at the top of the box, de la Torre became a spectator with a too-great view and central defender Chris Richards missed two opportunities to shut down the threat. McKennie, central defender Tim Ream and right back Joe Scally all bore some responsibility for the second.

“When you watch the goals back — I had the opportunity to do that in the coaches’ office — it’s really these fine moments, these split seconds where you need to be well-positioned, not open up any gaps in your back line,” Berhalter said. “And that’s where it went wrong.”

With the attempt to transform Musah into some semblance of Adams, though, it almost was certain to go wrong. The USMNT conjured a more compelling attack because of Reyna’s presence, but the ability to control the game went missing.

So many national team fans sided with Reyna during the controversy that developed as the team competed at last winter's World Cup. They got what they argued for in this game, but not what they wished.","Gio Reyna looks good in start for USMNT vs. Germany, but those involved in the finish are punished in 3-1 defeat",https://www.sportingnews.com/us/soccer/news/gio-reyna-start-usmnt-vs-germany/7b259d6825866019a619d5b8,Sporting News

No. 8 Alabama (11-1) must beat No. 1 Georgia in the SEC championship at 4 p.m. on Saturday on CBS. By that time, the Crimson Tide will know what happened with No. 7 Texas. Alabama did get help with No. 3 Washington beating No. 5 Oregon in the Pac-12 championship game Friday.

In what has become an annual tradition, Alabama coach Nick Saban might have to do some politicking to get the Crimson Tide into the CFP conversation even with a victory against Georgia.

The Bulldogs are 5.5-point favorites against Alabama in the SEC championship game at Mercedes-Benz Stadium in Atlanta, so all of this might be a moot point. Yet Alabama does have a path back to the CFP if they knock off the top-ranked team in the country.

MORE: CFP scenarios, from chalk to chaos

Can Alabama still make College Football Playoff?

The Crimson Tide are one of eight Power 5 teams with one loss or less heading into conference championship weekend. No two-loss team has ever made the four-team College Football Playoff.

Alabama has options with a victory against Georgia, but this would be the preferred scenario for the other four championship games:

Washington beats Oregon in Pac-12 championship

Alabama got this piece in their favor. Washington beat Oregon in the Pac-12 championship on Friday, and that knocks the Ducks into the two-loss pileup and out of the CFP picture.

Oklahoma State beats Texas in Big 12 championship

This would make life easier in a lot of ways for Alabama, because Texas has a 34-24 head-to-head non-conference victory against the Crimson Tide. The Longhorns would have two losses at that point, so there would be nothing to discuss.

Iowa beats Michigan in Big Ten championship

While this is the most-unlikely result, it could knock the Big Ten out of the CFP. Alabama is ranked behind No. 6 Ohio State – a one-loss team, but the Crimson Tide would leap-frog them with a victory against Georgia. The committee also would take an SEC champion over a one-loss Michigan team.

Louisville beats Florida State in ACC championship

Every one-loss team is rooting for the Cardinals to knock off the Seminoles, which would free up one of the four spots in the CFP.

Two Alabama College Football Playoff debates

If the above scenario unfolds, then the Crimson Tide would be in the CFP. Even if Michigan wins, Alabama would have a case with a Florida State loss.

Now, depending on how the other games shake out, these potential head-to-head arguments could happen over the weekend.

Alabama (12-1) vs. Texas (12-1)

Scenario No. 3 is the one everyone could be talking about. Washington, Florida State and Michigan win. Texas wins, too. That means there are three unbeatens and the committee must pick among the Longhorns, Crimson Tide and Bulldogs for the fourth spot. Texas beat Alabama at Bryant-Denny Stadium on Sept. 9. No matter how you try to talk around that, it might not happen for the Crimson Tide.

Alabama (12-1) vs. Florida State (13-0)

If Saban cannot win the argument with Texas, then would he try to target Florida State instead? The Seminoles might be playing with a backup quarterback in Tate Rodamaker, but they beat LSU in Week 1. That victory would be worth cashing in at this point.

Alabama strength of schedule

According to ESPN, the Crimson Tide rank sixth in the Football Power Index. Texas is No. 7. Alabama has three victories against ranked teams this season, but none of those were top-10 victories. Georgia would be the signature victory on the schedule.

Alabama strength of record

According to ESPN, the Crimson Tide rank No. 7 in strength of record. Texas is No. 6 in those rankings. Those are comparable totals, but again, the matchup against Georgia would carry much more weight on conference championship weekend. It is the chance for an ultimate signature victory.

Will Alabama make College Football Playoff?

Oregon lost. Seeing at least one of Texas or Florida State lose would be helpful for the Crimson Tide. There is the power of the SEC at work, and the emotional response by the committee to seeing Alabama beat Georgia might be enough on its own. The SEC is the only conference that has put a team in the CFP every single year.

If Alabama beats Georgia, then the arguments around those other conferences would get heated. Yet Florida State as an unbeaten team would still theoretically have the drop on the Crimson Tide. So would Texas based on the head-to-head victory. That could heat up quickly knowing Michigan likely will not lose in the Big Ten.","Can Alabama make College Football Playoff?

sports,Dean Straka,2023-10-01T22:41:50+00:00,"An eventful first month of the 2023 college football season is in the rearview mirror, and October should provide even more separation between pretenders and contenders in the ongoing College Football Playoff race. Four AP Top 25 matchups are on deck in Week 6, headlined by the annual Red River Rivalry game between No. 3 Texas and No. 12 Oklahoma at the Cotton Bowl Stadium in Dallas. It will be the first time the two rivals have matched up undefeated since 2011, both sitting at 5-0.

Saturday will also mark the first time that top-ranked Georgia has squared off against a ranked opponent this season as the Bulldogs welcome No. 20 Kentucky for a matchup of 5-0 squads. It's one of two ranked SEC matchups. No. 21 Missouri is also looking to stay undefeated as the Tigers host No. 23 LSU, which has now lost two games already after opening the year as a playoff contender.

The fourth and final AP Top 25 matchup of the day will be contested in ACC territory when No. 25 Louisville, sitting 5-0 in its first season under coach Jeff Brohm, sees No. 10 Notre Dame roll into town. The Fighting Irish are looking to secure a second ranked victory in as many weeks and remain in the playoff hunt after pulling off a comeback win at Duke in Week 5.

Betting lines for those battles and other key Week 6 matchups were released on Sunday, so let's dive in on what the oddsmakers have given us.

Odds via SportsLine consensus

No. 12 Oklahoma vs. No. 3 Texas (-5.5), Dallas: Always among college football's top spectacles, this year's Red River Rivalry could may serve as the Big 12 Championship Game preview. After one month, the Sooners and Longhorns are the only remaining undefeated Big 12 teams and are also the only ranked schools in the conference. Consider that a dream start for two programs that would love for nothing more than to run the league one more time before heading to the SEC in 2024. While the winner will emerge as the Big 12's clear front-runner, the playoff implications may be even more pressing. Neither team will be eliminated from that conversation Saturday, but the road becomes increasingly more difficult for the loser. A two-loss team has never cracked the playoff, so whoever comes up short in Dallas will likely have to win out to stand a chance.

No. 20 Kentucky at No. 1 Georgia (-15): The two-time reigning national champs are undefeated so far, but the Bulldogs have looked human at times. Georgia's two SEC victories have both required the Bulldogs to win in comeback fashion -- first at home against South Carolina in Week 3 and then at Auburn in Week 5. Georgia is still the heavy favorite for its first ranked matchup of the season, but coach Kirby Smart and company shouldn't sleep on the Wildcats. Kentucky's win against Florida in Week 5 saw running back Ray Davis take off for 280 yards and three touchdowns rushing, a mark that could have been much more considering Davis eclipsed the 200-yard mark well before halftime.

No. 23 LSU (-6.5) at No. 21 Missouri: While LSU has already gone from a trendy CFP pick to a two-loss team, Mizzou finds itself looking to improve on an impressive start that already includes a win against defending Big 12 champion and longtime former conference-mate Kansas State in Week 3. LSU is looking to right the ship on defense after a pair of shaky defensive performances. The Tigers allowed 426 yards in a 34-31 scare against Arkansas in Week 4 before giving up a whopping 637 yards Saturday in a 55-49 loss at Ole Miss. Mizzou quarterback Brady Cook ranks fourth in passing within the SEC (1,468 yards). He'll bring another test for that unit in Week 6. Through five weeks, Cook has thrown 11 touchdowns and is interception-free.

No. 10 Notre Dame (-6.5) at No. 25 Louisville: The Fighting Irish encounter another ranked opponent after being involved in dogfights each of the past two Saturdays. Notre Dame had its hearts broken by Ohio State in Week 4 before playing the role of heartbreaker at Duke in Week 5. Now it's on to Louisville, where the Irish encounter a Cardinals team that remains unbeaten a month into the Jeff Brohm era. While there isn't a ton separating these teams statistically on either side of the ball, Notre Dame is the more battle tested of the two, so it's not a shock to see the Irish checking in as a touchdown favorite. This is Louisville's first time facing ranked competition in 2023. It should give the best idea yet of what Brohm's squad is truly made of.

No. 11 Alabama (-3.5) at Texas A&M: The Crimson Tide have seemingly started to find a groove after an uninspiring 2-1 start, beating Ole Miss and Mississippi State a combined 64-27 for a 2-0 start in SEC play. But now comes a Texas A&M team that has caused fits for Alabama in their last two meetings. The Aggies stunned the top-ranked Tide on a walk-off field goal when Alabama last visited Kyle Field in 2021. In last year's meeting at Bryant-Denny Stadium Texas A&M had a chance to win the game on the final play of regulation before the Tide held off the Aggies for a 24-20 victory. An upset victory this weekend would move Texas A&M to 5-1 overall and 3-0 in SEC play. The Aggies have already dealt with the injury bug, losing starting quarterback Conner Weigman for the season. However, backup Max Johnson brings no shortage of SEC experience as the former LSU transfer prepares for his second consecutive start.

sports,Moumita Dutta,2023-11-03T21:58:48+00:00,"Manchester United are yet to recover from their large number of long-term injuries.

Man United vs Fulham Live: Premier League LIVE – MUN vs FUL LIVE – Manchester United are travelling to Greater London for their 11th Premier League match of the season. Fulham will host the Red Devils in the hopes of finally winning against them for the first time since 2019. It doesn’t seem like they will get a better chance considering Man United’s horrible run of form. However, the Red Devils came away as winners in both of their last games on road. Hence, the job will not be easy for Fulham.

Also Read

Manchester United will have to look for a way to get back to winning after 2 major defeats. They were on a 3-match winning run in all competitions when they faced Man City in their last Premier League match. There was little hope of winning that match considering their form. The fears came true and they lost 3-0 in the Manchester derby. They had some hope in their next match in the EFL Cup round of 16 match against Newcastle United.

The boys in blue 🤩 pic.twitter.com/0awNdmkXtT — Manchester City (@ManCity) November 3, 2023

Especially since they defeated the Magpies last term in the final of the EFL Cup. However, the reigning Carabao Cup champions could not defend their title any longer. They lost by another 3-0 margin to Newcastle United. With 5 wins and 5 defeats in the domestic league, they are now sitting in 8th position in the table. It still seems that coach Erik Ten Hag has the backing of the management. However, he will still have to pull up his team from the doom as soon as possible.

Fulham are in a worse situation than the Red Devils. After a mixed set of results with 3 wins, 3 draws, and 4 defeats, they are sitting in 14th position in the league table. However, they are still unbeaten in their last two games in all competitions. They won their last match by a 3-1 margin against Ipswich Town in the EFL Cup round of 16. Before that, they drew 1-1 against Brighton in their last Premier League match. However, they will have a tough time holding onto the streak in this match.

Manchester United Team News

Man United have been fighting a battle to line up their best XI as players fall victim to one injury after another. Casemiro, who got injured during the international break, got back on the field against Newcastle United in the EFL Cup match. However, he was taken off at half-time with a new hamstring issue. He will probably remain sidelined for weeks.

Other than Casemiro, Tyrell Malacia and Amad Diallo are suffering from knee issues, Lisandro Martinez is nursing a foot injury, Jadon Sancho is out due to disciplinary issues, and Luke Shaw is yet to recover from a muscle problem. Adding to that, Victor Lindelof is suffering from a bug that could see him miss this weekend’s match.

On the other hand, Raphael Varane who missed last day’s match due to an illness of his own, could be back in this match. Aaron Wan-Bissaka was also able to participate in the last match coming on as a substitute. Hence, he should be able to make a comeback. Marcus Rashford, Rasmus Hojlund, and Bruno Fernandes all could see themselves in the starting lineup.

Fulham Team News

Fulham’s injury situation has not improved so far. Adama Traore is suffering from a thigh problem, Issa Diop is nursing a foot issue, Kenny Tete is out due to an unspecified injury, and Tosin Adarabioyo is suffering from a groin injury.

However, Tete, Adarabioyo, and Traore are on their way to being fully fit. They could at least make the squad for this weekend’s high-stake match against Man United. Yet, the coach’s biggest concern revolves around his No. 9 position. With his first goal in the EFL Cup match, Rodrigo Muniz proved that he can be a good pick for the role on a regular basis.

The coach hinted that he could choose Muniz over Raul Jimenez who is yet to score since he joined Fulham this summer. On the other hand, Antonee Robinson, Tim Team, and Bernd Leno will be joining the team again to help them hold the fort in the back.

MLB live betting

The best sports betting apps offer live, in-game betting for Major League Baseball.

Live betting means you can bet on a game in progress, right down to what the next batter will do with the next pitch or what team will win the inning.

You’ll find live betting with top betting sites such as DraftKings, FanDuel, BetMGM, and Caesars.

The key to live betting is using a betting app to make your wagers. Apps allow you to track all of the changes — both on the diamond and in the odds — as they happen. You won’t find that response time at a brick-and-mortar sportsbook.

Some common MLB in-game betting lines includes:

Next team to score

Run line and moneyline odds

Total runs scored

Winner of the next inning

Player props, such as total hits or strikeouts

Bet on MLB run lines, moneylines, and totals

Three of the most popular bet types for Major League Baseball games are run lines, moneylines, and totals. In case you’re not familiar, let’s explain all three.

A moneyline wager is as straightforward as they come. You’re betting on which team you believe is going to win the game. Each team is given odds by the sportsbook to indicate their perceived chances of winning. The underdog is represented by a positive (+) number, and the favorite is represented by a negative number (-).

Similar to a point spread in other sports, the run line bet gives the underdog a handicap of 1.5 runs in the game. The underdog needs to lose by one run or win outright for bets on them to be successful, while the favorite in the game needs to win by two runs or more to cover the spread.

Totals bets, also known as over/unders, focus on the combined number of runs both teams score. Oddsmakers assign a total number of runs, and bettors must decide if the two teams will score over or under that predicted total. The actual winner of the game doesn’t matter.

You’ll find these staple bet types at every online sportsbook that supports MLB betting.

How to bet First 5 Innings in MLB

For bettors who prefer to focus on the early portion of a Major League Baseball game, First 5 Innings or F5 bets are ideal. These bets concern the outcome of just the first five innings of a game, which often takes out the uncertainty of relief pitchers replacing the starters.

You’ll find the F5 bets in the MLB tab of your online sportsbook or MLB betting app, where you can browse the available odds and lines for those particular wagers. You can still place bets on moneylines, run lines, or totals—focused on only the first five innings of play.

Keep in mind that the odds and lines will likely be different than those for the full game since they are concentrated on the first half of the game only.

Best MLB props and futures

MLB props and futures allow you to bet on team and player performance irrespective of individual game outcomes. Some examples of popular MLB futures odds and proposition bets include:

World Series: You can bet on which team you believe will become the next World Series champion. You’ll find World Series futures odds for these nearly as soon as the previous World Series comes to an end, and they’ll change based on offseason moves, team news, team performance, and more.

You’ll find World Series futures odds for these nearly as soon as the previous World Series comes to an end, and they’ll change based on offseason moves, team news, team performance, and more. MVP: Wager on the player you believe will take home the Most Valuable Player award for the season. This bet can be a fun way to keep tabs on certain players throughout the entire season.

Wager on the player you believe will take home the Most Valuable Player award for the season. This bet can be a fun way to keep tabs on certain players throughout the entire season. Home run leader: Which player do you think will crank out the most homers during the regular season?

Which player do you think will crank out the most homers during the regular season? Regular-season win totals: Make an over/under wager on a team based on the number of wins a sportsbook sets for them. Do you think your team will finish over that predicted win total, or will they come in under it?

Every sportsbook offers its own selection of futures and props bets, so shop around to find the sportsbooks that best fit your needs.

How to find the best MLB lines

It stands to reason that bettors always seek the most favorable MLB odds. “Line shopping” involves researching several different sportsbooks to compare odds.

This might involve using an odds feed, like the ones you’ll find here, or by comparing the odds on multiple online sportsbooks or MLB betting apps.

By doing this research, you’ll find the best odds for the bets you were already planning on making, which means you can maximize your potential return on your wager.

This can be a time-consuming process, but it also helps you boost your bankroll and give yourself the largest possible profit.

MLB betting rules at online sportsbooks

Every sportsbook has terms and conditions for all bets, MLB included. While those rules may be specific to each sportsbook, there are some general rules that should apply everywhere.

For example, MLB First 5 Innings bets are usually considered actionable after five innings of play, or 4.5 innings in the case of the home team having the lead.

Another rule many sportsbooks follow for baseball bets is weather-related, such as if a game is suspended due to rain or other weather conditions. These delays may lead to bets being refunded depending on the circumstances and the specific rules of your sportsbook.

Here are some other rules found at online sportsbooks for MLB betting.

Wagers include extra innings unless specified otherwise.

The game must start on the scheduled day (local stadium time) for bets to have action.

The game must go 9 innings or 8½ if the home team is winning for the run line to have action.

On ‘team to score first’ wagers, once a run is scored, the prop will be graded, regardless of how long the game lasts.

Wagers on postseason baseball series are based on the team to win the series, regardless of the number of games involved.

For player props, the player must be in the starting lineup for wagers to have action.

It’s important to read through the rules for baseball betting before placing your MLB bets, and you can find them in the terms and conditions section of your sportsbook’s website.

sports,Tom Gray,2023-10-18T21:30:31+00:00,"When Cuban super middleweight David Morrell steps between the ropes to defend his WBA ""regular"" super middleweight title against Sena Agbeko at the Armory in Minneapolis, there will be a lump in many ringsider's throats.

However, it's not the main event that will elicit this emotional response, it's the fact that December 16, 2023, will be the final broadcast of the beloved Showtime Championship Boxing series.

Showtime Boxing began in 1986 and has hosted some of the greatest and most famous fighters of all time, including Marvelous Marvin Hagler, Thomas Hearns, Roberto Duran, Sugar Ray Leonard, Mike Tyson, Evander Holyfield and Floyd Mayweather.

Among the elite-level professionals who have contributed in a broadcasting capacity are Tim Ryan, Gil Clancy, Al Bernstein, Steve Farhood, Barry Tompkins, Jim Gray, Mauro Ranallo and many others. The platform has been an institution and will be greatly missed.

“The company’s decision is not a reflection of the work we have done in recent years, nor of our long and proud history,” said Showtime Sports executive Stephen Espinoza in a statement to staff.

“Unfortunately, in a rapidly evolving media marketplace, the company has had to make difficult choices allocating resources, resetting priorities, and reshaping its content offering. While today’s news is certainly difficult and disappointing, it is entirely out of our control.”

MORE: Breakdown of Paramount shutting Showtime Sports

Espinoza couldn’t be more right in relation to the “long and proud history” of the company. Thanks to Showtime Boxing, fight fans have been treated to some of the greatest moments in the sport’s history and that should never be forgotten.

Just as was the case when HBO departed from boxing in 2018, the achievements of the fighters, as well as the individuals who gave them the platform to perform, should be celebrated.

The Sporting News now looks back at Showtime Boxing’s five greatest fights.

Marvelous Marvin Hagler vs. John Mugabi

Date: March 10, 1986

March 10, 1986 Location: Caesars Palace, Las Vegas

Caesars Palace, Las Vegas World titles: Undisputed middleweight

How about this for an intro? Hagler vs. Mugabi was Showtime Boxing’s maiden broadcast and they hit the ground running with one of the greatest middleweight championship fights of the modern era.

Coming off his stunning third-round knockout triumph over Thomas Hearns in April 1985, Hagler was the best fighter in the world and, at long last, an authentic superstar. After 11 months off – his longest period of inactivity by far – “The Marvelous One” had a taste for blood and returned to action with a vengeance.

John “The Best” Mugabi had earned his ring moniker. The Uganda-born power-puncher had a perfect record – 26 fights, 26 wins, 26 knockouts, with 10 of those stoppages coming in the first round. The challenger was moving from super welterweight to middleweight, but he'd carried his power up with him and he was hungry.

Mugabi got off to a great start, blasting Hagler with some horrific power shots in the early rounds. However, the more experienced Hagler made the necessary adjustments and began punishing his man heavily in the sixth. Mugabi gave it everything he had, but Hagler ended matters in the eleventh with a succession of crunching rights.

Result: Hagler KO 11

Roberto Duran vs. Iran Barkley

Date: February 24, 1989

February 24, 1989 Location: Convention Hall, Atlantic City, New Jersey

Convention Hall, Atlantic City, New Jersey World titles: WBC middleweight

This one had the makings of a 'passing of the torch' moment.

Duran was 37 years old and hadn’t scored a significant victory since posting an eighth-round stoppage of Davey Moore for the WBA super welterweight title in June 1983. In five and a half years, Duran had posted seven wins against three losses and he’d looked a shell of himself in a split decision victory over the unheralded Jeff Lanas in his most recent fight.

Meanwhile, the 28-year-old Barkley had already conquered one of The Four Kings when he spectacularly knocked out Thomas Hearns in three rounds to win the WBC middleweight title.

This result was foreboding for Duran fans who once watched Hearns obliterate their hero in two rounds. Barkley was a natural middleweight and at 6-1, he towered over the 5-7 Duran.

Never write off an all-time great. Motivated by the chance to become the first Hispanic fighter to win four world titles in as many weight classes, Duran had whipped himself into excellent fighting shape.

The ex-champ stunned Barkley with a right in the opening round, absorbed everything the champion could throw, and punctuated an astonishing performance with a pulverizing combination knockdown in round 11. It was close, but Duran took the decision and the championship.

Result: Duran SD 12

Mike Tyson vs. Evander Holyfield 1

Date: November 9, 1996

November 9, 1996 Location: MGM Grand, Las Vegas

MGM Grand, Las Vegas World titles: WBA heavyweight

In the early 1990s, this was considered the biggest heavyweight title matchup since Muhammad Ali and Joe Frazier clashed two decades earlier. But when Tyson was jailed for rape in 1992, the division was forced to move on without him.

While Tyson was incarcerated, Holyfield’s career went through peaks and troughs. He lost his championship to Riddick Bowe in one of the greatest heavyweight title fights of all time but regained it in a rematch. However, a loss to Moorer, a second defeat to Bowe, and an underwhelming win over Bobby Czyz had many convinced that “The Real Deal” was shot.

Tyson was released in March 1995 and quickly resumed his reign of terror. Just seven months into his comeback, the ex-champ regained the WBC title by stopping Britain’s Frank Bruno in three rounds and then splatted Bruce Seldon in one to pick up the WBA version.

“The Baddest Man on the Planet” was back and everyone was terrified. Well, almost everyone.

On fight night, Holyfield, unlike the vast majority of Tyson's opponents, came to the ring with a smile on his face. The challenger wasn’t intimidated by the Tyson mystique and turned in the greatest performance of his career.

Holyfield was dominant throughout, decked Tyson in round six, and put the finishing touches on an epic triumph in round 11.

Result: Holyfield TKO 11

Diego Corrales vs. Jose Luis Castillo 1

Date: May 7, 2005

May 7, 2005 Location: Mandalay Bay Events Centre, Las Vegas

Mandalay Bay Events Centre, Las Vegas World titles: WBC, WBO, Ring Magazine lightweight

Corrales had reestablished his image after being outclassed by Floyd Mayweather in 2001. While “Chico” had fallen short against the excellent Joel Casamayor, he’d avenged that defeat to pick up the vacant WBO super featherweight crown. Upon moving up to lightweight, Corrales took on WBO champ Acelino Frietas and came from behind to score a dramatic stoppage.

Castillo also had a history with Mayweather. In fact, many fans believe that the Mexican star deserved to win a decision against him in April 2002. However, when Mayweather won the rematch decisively, Castillo, like Corrales, was forced to rebuild and he did so courtesy of excellent wins over Juan Lazcano, Casamayor, and Julio Diaz. The Lazcano triumph gave Castillo the vacant WBC title.

Corrales vs. Castillo was one of the greatest fights in history. Despite having functional height and reach advantages, Corrales elected to meet Castillo on the inside and the action was incredible.

In the 10th, Castillo decked his man with a sharp left hook, then put him over again with another left. Following both knockdowns, “Chico” had spat out his mouthpiece for which he received a point deduction.

Battered and woozy, his left eye almost closed, Corrales needed a miracle. He found it.

When the bout resumed, Corrales nailed his man with a hard right and an even harder left. Castillo wilted and was stopped seconds later by a savage, head-snapping assault. There’s been nothing like it since.

Result: Corrales TKO 10

Israel Vazquez vs. Rafael Marquez 3

Date: March 1, 2008

March 1, 2008 Location: Home Depot Centre, Carson, California

Home Depot Centre, Carson, California World titles: WBC and Ring Magazine super bantamweight

Criminally overlooked, it’s arguable that Mexicans Israel Vazquez and Rafael Marquez turned in the most consistently exciting trilogy in modern boxing history. Yes, there was an ill-advised part four, won by Marquez, but this was and always will be a trilogy.

While Ali-Frazier II, Gatti-Ward II, and Barrera-Morales II didn’t live up to acts I and III of those fistic plays, Vazquez and Marquez produced three back-to-back classics that will forever stand the test of time.

The only reason the first encounter, which was won by Marquez, wasn’t awarded Fight of the Year 2007 was because it was beaten out by the rematch, which was won by Vazquez, the same year. The third encounter was the best of the series and took Fight of the Year for 2008.

As was the case in fights one and three, the ebb and flow of the bout was incredible. Both men traded hellacious combinations throughout and Vazquez hit the canvas in round four.

The superior speed and timing of Marquez was carrying the day but Vazquez slowly battled his way back and was aided further when his rival was deducted a point for a low blow in round 10.

But it was the 12th and final round that took this fight into the stratosphere. Desperate for a big finish, Vazquez nailed his countryman in the closing seconds and only the ropes held Marquez up.

Ruled a knockdown, this crucial moment gave Vazquez the split decision win and saw him retain his championships. It doesn’t get any better.

Result: Vazquez SD 12

sports,Chirag Radhyan,2023-10-07T21:14:09+00:00,"Dillon Danis has been going back and forth with the Paul family long before his upcoming fight against Logan Paul, scheduled for October 14th. At the moment, Danis is preparing hard for his Misfits contest, as he’s tried to get in the head of his opponent leading up to the bout. As a result, Danis has garnered over a million followers on X. ‘El Jefe’ has been trying to dig up the past relationships of Logan Paul’s fiancée, Nina Agdal, as a way to create turmoil in Paul’s mindset during the fight.

America’s Favorite Video Today

However, this beef was first started by Logan Paul’s younger brother, Jake Paul. He called out Danis on his Instagram story in 2020, by taking a hit at his rumored ex-girlfriend, Savannah Montano. So Danis’s target at Agdal could have a revenge angle that many didn’t know about. Even Logan addressed the topic of Montano and Jake during their first press conference. So, who is this girl? What’s the actual story here?

Who is Dillon Danis’ ex-girlfriend often linked with Jake Paul?

ADVERTISEMENT Article continues below this ad

Savannah Montano was quite a trending name back in 2020, and that was mostly because of her relationship with the Bellator MMA fighter, Dillon Danis. Montano is a successful Instagram model, with around 1.6 million followers on her social media. The couple turned a lot of heads during their relationship, sharing some NSFW steamy pictures and videos for their fans.

Despite their controversial relationship, Montano also gained some attention after Jake Paul used her to call out Dillon Danis for a fight. After knocking out the ex-NBA star, Nate Robinson, ‘The Problem Child’, was on the hunt to find his next opponent. At the time, the name that popped up the most was 2-0 Dillon Danis. So, when he shared the screenshot of the FaceTime with Danis’s ex-girlfriend, the fans started drawing connections.

Paul somehow found the model’s number and sent her a FaceTime request. Many started to believe that Montano was having an affair and cheating on her then-boyfriend Danis. Paul posted two stories. In the first one, he wrote, “Aye [Dillon Danis], come get your girl back.” And then in the second one, he took another hit at the fighter by writing, “Can’t wait to see you soon.” So this begs the question, is it true? Was Paul actually involved in an affair with Savannah Montano?

Did Jake Paul and Savannah Montano hook up?

This callout didn’t help much, as Jake Paul never could finalize his fight with Dillon Danis. Instead, he ended up taking the fight against the former Olympic MMA artist, Ben Askren in 2021. He again won the fight by a knockout, while many fans still thought that Danis was smart to not respond to the Youtuber-turned-boxer. Still, Paul tried his best to involve Montano in their non-existent tussle.

Besides the Instagram Stories, Jake Paul also told TMZ, about the entanglement with Savannah Montano. He said, “Dillon, I know you’re watching this … Just remember you’re still a bitch and I hooked up with your girlfriend. Savannah, how you doing? What’s good?” However, Montano completely denied any relation with the Influencer boxer whatsoever. She responded to Paul’s stories through a video and gave her side of the story.

She said, “I’m dead confused at some of you guys going, ‘Oh, but why did you answer his call?’ As if I have his f**king number saved in my phone! It was literally a random number. You can literally see in the video, I’m like, ‘Who is this?’” So she denied the accusations of hooking up with Paul and even felt disgusted by the speculations.

However, her current relationship status is unknown. Even three years later, many followers are still not convinced about her breakup with Dillon Danis.

Dillon Danis and Savannah Montano breakup reality

As of now, it’s not completely clear whether the couple is still together or not. They haven’t made any claims of breakup and have been silent about their relationship with each other. The only things that have changed are Savannah’s Instagram feed. She has stopped posting pictures with Danis, which were quite prevalent back in 2020. Also, another thing that hints towards their breakup is Danis’s first press conference for the Logan Paul fight.

During the fight, Logan Paul brought up the topic of Montano, when Danis pointedly mentioned their breakup. Paul said, “Yo you’ve been so salty ever since Savannah rejected your a** to go hook up with real athletes. You don’t gotta take that s**t out on me because my brother hooked up with your ex.” Danis scoffed at Maverick’s claim and clapped back, “At least I got rid of the sl*t, you’re marrying one.”

So, this tells the fans that Danis is no longer together with Montano. Anyway, the fans could look out for her attendance at Danis’s first-ever boxing debut on October 14 at the AO Arena, Manchester. Although there were rumors about Danis pulling out, it seems the fight is still going to take place. So, her presence at Danis’s ringside may make things even more complicated. What are your thoughts about this? Are they still together? Tell us in the comments section.

sports,Dan Treacy,2023-10-08T22:47:03+00:00,"Jerry Jones said earlier in the week that Sunday night's game would show him how the Cowboys stack up against the NFL's best.

The answer? Not very well.

Everything that could go wrong for Dallas on Sunday did go wrong, in a game that confirmed a 49ers team that ended the Cowboys' season in each of the last two years remains a level above its NFC counterpart.

The 49ers carved up Dallas' defense on the opening drive, and that was a sign of what was to come. Brock Purdy threw four touchdowns in the 42-10 rout, including three to George Kittle. Christian McCaffrey scored a touchdown for a 14th consecutive game as all of San Francisco's offensive weapons got involved.

Defensively, the 49ers were relentless. Nobody had a larger impact than Fred Warner, who finished the night with an interception, sack and forced fumble in a swarming performance.

The Cowboys' offense looked very much like it did in last season's playoff exit -- uncomfortable and out of sorts. Dallas was sluggish through the first half of the game, and the night unraveled quickly when Dak Prescott threw three interceptions in the second half. It got out of hand so quickly that Sam Darnold entered the game for the 49ers with more than 12 minutes remaining.

For Prescott and the Cowboys, questions about whether they can get over the hump against the class of the NFC will persist. While their wins have been dominant, Dallas already sits two games behind the Eagles in the NFC East.

The 49ers are rolling right along, with all of their major offensive weapons now healthy and the defense living up to its billing as well. San Francisco, now 5-0, doesn't face a team with a winning record until Week 10, though the Browns, Vikings and Bengals are far from automatic wins for Kyle Shanahan's team.

Cowboys vs. 49ers results, highlights from 'Sunday Night Football'

(All times Eastern)

Final: 49ers 42, Cowboys 10

11:26 p.m. — That'll do it! The 49ers trounce the Cowboys and reassert themselves as one of the NFL's most dominant teams. Through five games, San Francisco is unbeaten.

11:24 p.m. — These teams are trading possessions as the clock winds down. There was a brief skirmish officials had to break up as frustrations mount for Dallas.

11:14 p.m. — A sack by Kevin Givens ends Rush's first drive of the night and sets up a Bryan Anger punt. Backups are in nearly all around for the 49ers.

11:09 p.m. — Cooper Rush is in the game for the Cowboys...

11:07 p.m. — Mitch Wishnowsky with an excellent punt for the 49ers, who are just trying to get through the rest of the game injury-free.

11:04 p.m. — Sam Darnold has entered the game with 49ers. So, that's where we are with 12 minutes still on the clock.

11:00 p.m. INTERCEPTION — So much for that. Oren Burks gets the 49ers' third interception of the night as Prescott continues to struggle against this San Francisco defense.

10:59 p.m. — The Cowboys are moving the ball now, when it's a bit too late. Tony Pollard rips off a 26-yard run to finally break through.

49ers 42, Cowboys 10

10:53 p.m. TOUCHDOWN — And just like that, Jordan Mason runs in for another 49ers touchdown! This is ugly on all levels for the Cowboys, and Leighton Vander Esch is now down as well. 42-10, 49ers.

10:52 p.m. INTERCEPTION — Fred Warner now has a sack, forced fumble and an interception tonight. A pass from Prescott is deflected into his hands, and the 49ers have another instant scoring opportunity.

49ers 35, Cowboys 10

10:47 p.m. TOUCHDOWN — Purdy hits Kyle Juszczyk for the 49ers' fifth touchdown of the night. That's four touchdowns for Purdy alone, and San Francisco is pouring it all on the Cowboys.

End of third quarter: 49ers 28, Cowboys 10

10:43 p.m. — San Francisco is moving the ball inch-by-inch now, and the 'Niners are a yard away from making this a 25-point game.

10:38 p.m. — The 49ers are on the verge of entering the red zone after a 19-yard catch by Jauan Jennings. Purdy is up to 242 yards to go along with his three touchdowns.

10:32 p.m. INTERCEPTION — Prescott heaves it downfield under pressure and it's intercepted by Tashaun Gipson. For a Cowboys team that has embarrassed a few opponents this year, they might be on the bad end of an ugly game here.

49ers 28, Cowboys 10

10:27 p.m. TOUCHDOWN — Not one, not two, THREE touchdowns for George Kittle. The 49ers have everything working offensively tonight, and any Kittle fantasy owners are thrilled.

10:25 p.m. — Aiyuk's loss is Deebo Samuel's gain. Samuel goes 43 yards on the very next play, which tells you how automatic the 49ers' offense is right now. San Francisco is in the red zone looking to make this a three-score game.

10:23 p.m. — An offensive holding call wipes out a 40-yard gain from Aiyuk. Wow. That's a momentum swing. Spencer Burford is the culprit.

10:21 p.m. — The Purdy-to-Aiyuk connection continues to get stronger. Aiyuk goes for 23 yards to give the 49ers some breathing room after opening their drive with a false start.

49ers 21, Cowboys 10

10:17 p.m. FIELD GOAL — The 49ers' defense tightens the screws and limits Dallas to a field goal. Brandon Aubrey drills it from 50 yards out, and it's down to a 21-10 lead for San Francisco.

10:13 p.m. — Prescott hits CeeDee Lamb for a big 29-yard gain. That quickly takes the Cowboys into 49ers territory to start the second half.

End of first half: 49ers 21, Cowboys 7

9:58 p.m. — San Francisco's defense is all over the Cowboys yet again. It's Dre Greenlaw's turn to sack Prescott, and Dallas is waving the white flag on the half. They'll start the second half with the ball.

9:56 p.m. — 49ers edge rusher Drake Jackson is walking off after requiring some medical attention on the field.

9:52 p.m. — The 49ers tried to put something together, but a third down pass to Aiyuk was too low. Dallas has a minute to try and get something before halftime.

9:45 p.m. — The Cowboys looked better on third down on their last drive, but Prescott's third down pass to Ferguson is short of the line to gain and ends this drive quickly. The 49ers will have a couple minutes to blow this game open before halftime.

49ers 21, Cowboys 7

9:38 p.m. TOUCHDOWN — McCaffrey pushes through for the touchdown. That's his 14th consecutive game finding the end zone, and it puts the 'Niners back up two scores.

9:37 p.m. — Deebo Samuel takes some big hits but gets the 49ers down to the one-yard line. San Francisco is knocking on the door again.

9:35 p.m. — The Cowboys had done a pretty nice job of containing McCaffrey to this point, but the former Pro-Bowler takes a screen pass for 19 yards to push the Niners to the edge of the red zone.

9:31 p.m. — Aiyuk with a quick 15-yard catch to start the 49ers' drive. He's up to 35 yards on three catches.

49ers 14, Cowboys 7

9:27 p.m. TOUCHDOWN — KaVontae Turpin flashes his speed, gets separation, and hauls in Prescott's pass in the end zone! A perfectly drawn-up 26-yard play puts Dallas right back in this game.

9:24 p.m. — Prescott hits Jake Ferguson for a big third down conversion, and then some. That's 20 yards.

9:23 p.m. — Tony Pollard has had a tough night so far, with just 10 yards on six touches.

9:22 p.m. — Prescott fires a nice pass to Cooks to give the Cowboys another first down.

9:20 p.m. — The Cowboys have a first down! And it only took 17+ minutes. Dallas is still operating in its own territory, but it feels like points are needed on this drive to keep the game within reach.

49ers 14, Cowboys 0

9:14 p.m. TOUCHDOWN — That was quick! Purdy hits Kittle after some trickery, and it's a two-score night for the tight end. 49ers lead, 14-0.

9:13 p.m. — The Cowboys are forced to punt out of their own end zone after Fred Warner sacks Prescott. Warner now has a sack and a fumble. The 49ers will have strong field position.

9:10 p.m. FUMBLE — Oh no again! They're trading fumbles! Jourdan Lewis takes the ball right out of McCaffrey's arms and spoils the 49ers' hopes of making this a 14-0 game.

End of first quarter: 49ers 7, Cowboys 0

9:04 p.m. — Confirmed: 49ers ball. San Francisco has an instant opportunity here.

9:01 p.m. FUMBLE — Oh no! Pollard gets the ball knocked out deep in the Cowboys' own territory, and it looks like it was recovered by the 49ers. Officials are checking to make sure nobody was out of bounds, but that ball was very much out of Pollard's control. The 49ers could be set up in the red zone.

8:59 p.m. — The drive completely falls apart for the 49ers. A delay of game penalty sets San Francisco back, and Christian McCaffrey is dropped for a five-yard loss on 3rd & 15. Not allowing even a field goal is a huge win for Dallas.

8:56 p.m. — The 49ers are excelling on third down early in this game, and Purdy flips it to Kyle Juszczyk to keep the Niners' drive alive on 3rd & 1.

8:54 p.m. — Now Kearse lines up offsides... That extends the drive for the 49ers, who aren't moving as freely as they were on that opening drive.

8:50 p.m. — Jayron Kearse comes through with the Cowboys' first sack of the night, but Deebo Samuel makes up 11 of the 12 yards San Francisco needs on the next play.

8:46 p.m. — There's the first catch of the night for Lamb, but he doesn't get the first down and Dak Prescott is sacked by Nick Bosa to quickly end the drive. This 49ers defense has picked up right where it left off against the Cowboys in January.

8:44 p.m. — Dallas' second drive starts out with Tony Pollard getting dropped for a loss.

8:40 p.m. — Big-time stop by the Cowboys' defense as Johnathan Hankins deflects Purdy's third down pass with his helmet and forces a punt.

8:36 p.m. — The 49ers' defense was all over Dallas on that drive. Three plays, two incompletions, and now the Cowboys will punt it right back.

49ers 7, Cowboys 0

8:30 p.m. TOUCHDOWN — Purdy finds a wide open Kittle in the end zone for the score! That was a well-scripted opening drive by Kyle Shanahan, and San Francisco has an early 7-0 lead.

8:27 p.m. — A little bit of chaos as Deebo Samuel drops a ball that was pretty close to being a fumble, but it's all a non-issue as Dallas is hit with an offsides penalty. The 49ers are right about in field goal range.

8:25 p.m. — After a facemask penalty and a nine-yard pass to Brandon Aiyuk, the 49ers are already over midfield.

8:23 p.m. — Kickoff is a bit on the later end, but we are about to get underway. The 49ers will start with the ball.

8:10 p.m. — Jerry Jones said this week that this game will be a test of how the Cowboys match up with the NFL's best, as if there wasn't already pressure on Dallas to show something after the 49ers knocked them out of the playoffs in back-to-back years.

7:56 p.m. — Frank Gore and Vernon Davis are in the house! A couple greats from the 49ers' last golden era under Jim Harbaugh.

Frank Gore and Vernon Davis in the building for SNF 🔥 pic.twitter.com/XMKgK4aeaF — OurSF49ers (@OurSf49ers) October 8, 2023

7:36 p.m. — CeeDee Lamb is coming off back-to-back games with only four catches. Is he due for a huge performance tonight?

7:11 p.m. — New 49ers acquisition Randy Gregory is officially inactive against his former team.

7:01 p.m. — The Eagles are going to win in Los Angeles, so the 49ers need a win to keep pace atop the NFC. After they had to play the last two NFC championship games on the road, the No. 1 seed is undoubtedly in the back of their minds.

6:45 p.m. — The run of great prime-time weather continues, as it's set to be in the high 70s and sunny in Santa Clara tonight. No excuses for these powerful offenses.

sports,Nick Brinkerhoff,2023-12-07T22:17:00+00:00,"The season of giving is here as we wind down the 2023 NFL season. We've already given you winners and losers, highs and lows, sleepers and busts, and a few moments to forget, but we hope to keep giving you more of the positives to look back on as the season enters its final weeks. If you need to scratch that fantasy itch with your season-long league coming to an end, look no further than our FanDuel DFS lineup for Week 14, which will ideally provide us with enough cash to boost the economy this holiday season.

Before we break down our picks and strategy, here are the most notable scoring rules for FanDuel contests: four-point passing TDs and half-point PPR.

WEEK 14 FANTASY ADVICE:

Sleepers | Busts | Projections | Start-sit

FanDuel Picks Week 14: NFL DFS lineup for GPP tournaments

Sunday main slate, $60,000 budget

QB Gardner Minshew, Colts @ Bengals ($6,900). Minshew Mania is eyeing a postseason spot and has the Colts with a 7-5 record heading into the final few weeks of the season. Now he gets a Bengals team that's limping to the finish thanks to Joe Burrow's thumb injury that cost him the season. The Colts are a motivated bunch in a tight AFC South, while evidence continues to mount that they knocked the Shane Steichen hire out of the park. Minshew is a capable fantasy starter, as shown by his 312 yards and two TDs last week, and he's certainly worth another DFS flier in a week that offers very few worthwhile value options.

RB Joe Mixon, Bengals vs. Colts ($7,200). Mixon has been forced to step up without Burrow under center, doubling as a runner and receiver for Cincinnati. Jake Browning has relied heavily upon the veteran RB, evidenced by Mixon's two touchdowns on Monday night against the Jaguars. Burrow's injury has made Mixon arguably the Bengals' top fantasy option now. We'll gladly insert the RB into the lineup in a good matchup against a Indianapolis team that's had some issues defending RBs, notably getting torched by Derrick Henry and Tyjae Spears one week ago.

WEEK 14 DFS:

DK lineup | Best values | Best stacks

RB Breece Hall, Jets vs. Texans ($6,400). It's Week 14 and there is a Jets player in this DFS lineup. How bad can it get? The good news is that it can always get worse, and Hall's role in this offense makes him a worthy dart throw in this lineup. He continues to see plenty of carries and a big role in the passing game. While the offense can't score, the volume is there against a Texans team that has struggled to defend RBs out of the backfield. If the Jets manage to find the end zone for the first time since sliced bread was invented, Hall has a good chance to do it. Considering it's borderline insane to include a Jets player in any DFS lineup, that means we might be one of the few who actually roster him, which could help our cause.

WR Mike Evans, Buccaneers @ Falcons ($8,500). Evans hauled in six-of-eight targets for 82 yards and a score last time he saw the Falcons, and he's only gotten better, putting together another great season for Tampa as Baker Mayfield's top option in the passing game. The incredible target share gives us no reason to think that won't continue.

WEEK 14 PPR RANKINGS:

QBs | RBs | WRs | TEs | D/STs | Kickers

WR Michael Pittman Jr., Colts @ Bengals ($8,000). Imagine saying back in the summer that the Minshew-Pittman stack would be one of the best in fantasy this season. It's a wild reality, but also one that continues to fly under the radar more often than not. Pittman is coming off back-to-back games of at least 100 yards, and he just put up a season-high 16 against the Titans. That volume doesn't grow on trees, and there are no signs of the WR slowing down anytime soon as the Colts push for a playoff spot.

WR Deebo Samuel, 49ers vs. Seahawks ($7,500). Samuel rewarded us with a big performance against the Eagles, backing up all the talking he did since losing in the NFC Championship Game last season. There's no reason to believe that can't continue against the same Seahawks team that he carved up on Thanksgiving. Samuel has historically feasted against Seattle, and with the Niners eyeing that top spot in the NFC, we should expect that to be the case again.

WEEK 14 STANDARD RANKINGS:

QBs | RBs | WRs | TEs | D/STs | Kickers

TE Gerald Everett, Chargers @ Broncos ($5,100). The Chargers offense is tough to watch right now. Between injuries and drops, we can't determine what is more maddening on a week-to-week basis, but Everett has a great matchup in Week 14, one that we've continued to target quite often this year. Everett hasn't posted 50 yards or more in a game this season, but this should be his best chance to do that plus have a good shot at a TD. We'll take the discount for someone who should outperform his DFS salary.

FLEX RB Dameon Pierce, Texans @ Jets ($6,100). MetLife Stadium promises to be the site of yet another bad weather game and all that rain means we'll be seeing plenty of the RBs on Sunday. Pierce appears to have regained the RB1 spot from Devin Singletary, evidenced by his 15 carries last week to just eight for his teammate. Efficiency has been a problem for the sophomore back, but the Jets present another decent matchup for a RB to find their footing. With an ugly game on tap, Pierce should have more than enough opportunities to deliver from a fantasy standpoint.

DEF New Orleans Saints vs. Panthers ($4,300). The Panthers are and have been a complete disaster this year, only shielded by the fact that they play in Charlotte rather than the Boston and New York areas. They have a QB who can't compete with the extreme lack of talent up and down the roster, a lame-duck coaching staff, and countless other factors. They're 1-11 and are playing a divisional rival that, despite being 5-7, is somehow not out of the playoff race. New Orleans' offense is a mess, but the defense should be primed to bounce back after a rough Week 13.

Best SuperDraft NFL DFS Picks for Week 14

This year, we're also listing our favorite DFS plays on SuperDraft.

For those unfamiliar, SuperDraft's DFS scoring involves point multipliers as opposed to traditional salary-capped or tiered contests. A winning lineup will likely feature a strong mix of stud fantasy contributors with 1x-1.6x boosts, as well as matchup-based sleepers with larger multipliers. Each player is assigned a scoring multiplier based on their value as determined by SuperDraft. Users can roster any player in their lineup with no restrictions.

sports,Jake Lambourne,2023-12-12T22:36:24+00:00,"Al Nassr striker Cristiano Ronaldo looks set to be the top scorer in 2023 after his Boxing Day double against Al Ittihad.

The 38-year-old may have swapped Europe for the Middle East, but he has showed no signs of slowing down in Saudi Arabia.

8 Ronaldo has been in lethal form for club and country in 2023 Credit: Getty

Ronaldo linked up with Al Nassr in the winter transfer window after parting ways with Manchester United following his explosive interview with Piers Morgan.

Liverpool legend Jamie Carragher described the five-time Ballon d'Or winner's switch to the Gulf nation as a 'sad end' to his career, but Ronaldo continues to prove his doubters wrong.

But he isn't the only star that has been in great form, with players across Europe banging them in for fun.

The Portugal international Ronaldo has been battling with with Kylian Mbappe, Erling Haaland and Harry Kane for the title of the best goalscorer of 2023..

Here talkSPORT.com runs you through how Ronaldo compares to the top six highest scoring European based footballers this year...

7. Lautaro Martinez (Inter Milan) - 37 goals

All of Martinez's goals this year have come at club level for Inter Milan, with none coming on the international scene for Argentina.

With so many goals this campaign, it's no surprise that the Serie A giants are desperate to tie him down to a new deal.

He currently leads the Scudetto Golden Boot race - six more than closest rival Domenico Berardi.

6. Santiago Gimenez (Feyenoord/Mexico) - 39 goals

One of the most exciting strikers in world football, the 22-year-old has taken European football by storm.

Joining Dutch side Feyenoord in the summer of 2022, he fired Arne Slot's men to the Eredivisie championship with 15 goals.

With 20 goals this season along with two strikes for Mexico, it's clear to see why Arsenal, Tottenham and Chelsea have all been linked with a move.

8 Gimenez seems destined for a big move in the near future Credit: Getty

5. Romelu Lukaku (Roma/Belgium) - 40 goals

After reuniting with Jose Mourinho at Roma in the summer, Lukaku has found his goalscoring form once again.

The Belgian has been firing back in Serie A following another loan move from Chelsea, netting in almost all of his starts this season.

He has also found his shooting boots for his country, most notably scoring four in a 5-0 win over Azerbaijan in November.

Lukaku's career seems to have reignited and that has seen him close to claiming a place as one of the highest goalscorers this year.

4. Erling Haaland (Manchester City/Norway) - 50 goals

No player in Premier League history has made more of an impact following their arrival than Haaland, who broke the goal record for a single season with 36 strikes last term.

He has already been firing in many top-flight goals this term - as well as being the joint-leading scorer from the Champions League group stages.

Just six out of his 50 goals in 2023 have been for his national side Norway, with Haaland helping the Citizens to a historic treble last campaign.

With two games left for City in 2023, Haaland has time to be the overall top scorer, though it remains to be seen if Pep Guardiola will play him against Everton and Sheffield United.

Haaland has missed City's last five games with a foot injury, but it is believed he could be in contention now to return to action.

8 Haaland is the leading goalscorer in the Premier League this season

2*. Kylian Mbappe (Paris Saint-Germain/France) - 52 goals

Paris Saint Germain's all-time record scorer with 233 goals, it's easy to forget that the ex-Monaco man is still just 24 years old.

He has added even more goals to his tally for Les Parisiens this term, while he has fired in ten times for the French national team.

Mbappe's overall tally of 46 goals for Les Bleus is just ten shy of Giroud's current record.

In the final year of his contract at Parc des Princes, Real Madrid are favourites to secure a free transfer next summer, but they face competition from Liverpool.

PSG have no games left to play in 2023 due to the French winter break, with Mbappe therefore unable to catch Ronaldo.

8 Mbappe has enjoyed a stunning 2023 having scored 52 goals for club and country Credit: AFP

2*. Harry Kane (Bayern Munich/Tottenham/England) - 52 goals

A stunning 2022/23 season saw Bayern splash out over £100m to sign the Spurs legend in August.

And Kane has repaid the Bundesliga club's faith having broken a number of records with his 25 goals so far this season.

The leading scorer [22 goals] in the German top-flight, the Three Lions skipper set a new Bundesliga record last month by finding the back of the net 17 times in his opening 11 outings.

Kane, who has scored nine goals for England in 2023, is also the first player to register a hat-trick in their first outing against Borussia Dortmund.

It should come as no surprise that he is also on course to score the most goals in a debut Bundesliga campaign as he hunts down Uwe Seeler's record of 30 for Hamburg in the 1963/64 season.

As well as that, Kane is on track to break Robert Lewandowski's record of 41 goals in a single season.

He's adding assists, too, as evidenced by his 'filthy' effort against Man United in the Champions League.

Like Mbappe, Kane cannot overtake Ronaldo's tally due to the German winter break.

1. Cristiano Ronaldo (Al Nassr/Portugal) - 53 goals

Ronaldo has chipped in with 43 goals for Al Nassr to prove he never left his shooting boots back in Europe.

He has even banged in ten times for Portugal, as he helped the Euro 2016 winners triumph in all ten of their Euro 2024 qualifying matches.

His half-century in 2023 is the eighth time in his career that he has scored at least 50 goals in a calendar year.

His two strikes in the 5-2 win against Karim Benzema's Al Ittihad saw him leapfrog above Kane and Mbappe.

And with Al Nassr still having one match left before 2024, he could add to his ever-growing tally.",Top goalscorers of 2023: Cristiano Ronaldo brings up 50 goals with Erling Haaland and Harry Kane also high on list,https://talksport.com/football/1674719/top-goalscorers-2023-ronaldo-haaland-kane/,TalkSport
sports,Dushyant Singh,2023-12-25T21:27:33+00:00,"The United States of America is home to several entertaining sports and leagues. However, football and basketball have resonated more deeply with the majority of the population than other offerings. Since their inception, the two sports have captured the imaginations of the fans and captivated them with their entertaining offerings—namely, the NFL and the NBA. The NBA and the NFL share a fierce rivalry because they stand out as the two preeminent professional sports leagues in the United States. While the NFL enjoys greater popularity within the United States, the NBA far outperforms its counterpart in global popularity and impact.

America’s Favorite Video Today

Both leagues have crafted their own festive traditions with the NFL’s Thanksgiving Day games and the NBA’s Christmas Day matchups. These special events have become cherished customs, captivating fans in their unique ways. Thanksgiving Day games are as intertwined with Thanksgiving as turkeys, while Christmas Day games have become as synonymous with Christmas as eggnog and presents. However, when comparing the two festive traditions, which one holds more significance, or which tradition has garnered greater popularity?

How do NBA’s Christmas Day games compare to NFL’s Thanksgiving Day games?

Both traditions hold a special place in the hearts of fans, creating an annual spectacle that goes beyond the typical sporting event. The NBA’s Christmas Day games is a tradition which is even older than the NFL’s Super Bowl. The first Christmas Day game dates back to 1947, when the league featured three games as a festive treat for basketball fans. Since then, the NBA Christmas Day has only grown in stature and significance. Last season, Christmas Day games averaged 4.27 viewers across all platforms. The significance of this tradition can be evaluated by the fact that these games attract about 200% more viewers than any other regular season game.

However, despite these impressive viewership numbers, the NFL’s Thanksgiving Day games eclipse them by a considerable margin. This season, NFL’s Thanksgiving Day games created history. Across all the three games, the NFL recorded an average viewership of 34.1 million. These figures surpassed last year’s record viewership of 33.6 million. Furthermore, the combined unduplicated audience for all three games reached 133 million, marking the second-highest total audience on Thanksgiving, surpassed only by last year’s numbers.

These figures paint a pretty one-sided picture, but the choice is much more nuanced. Comparing the NBA Christmas Day Games and NFL Thanksgiving Day Games comes down to personal preference. Each tradition holds its own significance, adding to the diverse fabric of American sports culture. Whether one prefers the slam dunks and three-pointers of the NBA or the hard-hitting action on the football field, both traditions offer a festive and entertaining way to celebrate holidays with family and friends.

Are the NFL’s new decisions threatening the NBA’s Christmas Day dominance?

The enduring success and importance of Christmas Day games suggest that this 77-year-old tradition will continue for the foreseeable future. However, the NFL’s recent decisions could threaten the NBA’s stronghold on Christmas. Traditionally, the NFL has avoided Christmas Day games that fall outside of their broadcasting window. However, last year the NFL averaged 22.1 million viewers on Christmas Day games, and 2023 could be even bigger.

via Reuters REUTERS/Kai Pfaffenbach |

The NFL has lined up a mouth-watering slate for Christmas. Superstars like Patrick Mahomes, Brock Purdy and Jalen Hurts are all set to take the field on Christmas. According to some estimations, the NFL’s total viewership during the festive period could outperform that of the NBA by almost 75 million viewers. This creates a huge dilemma for the NBA, as traditionally they have maintained a firm grip on Christmas.

However, it still remains to be seen whether the NFL pursues Christmas Day games in the future. The NFL’s top executives have stated that they won’t schedule games on Christmas if the holiday falls outside their regular broadcasting window. But, enough of the negative stuff, let’s shift our attention to the positive aspects.

What does the NBA have in store for Christmas?

As Christmas arrives, so do the NBA’s Christmas Day games, a tradition that predates even the Super Bowl. This year’s Christmas Day slate is loaded, with games taking place in New York, Los Angeles and Miami. NBA superstars like LeBron, Steph, Giannis, Luka, Jokic, Durant, and many others are scheduled to take the court later tonight. The NBA strategically plans matchups featuring elite teams and players, as these games are broadcasted to over 200 countries and translated into more than 50 languages.

The Milwaukee Bucks and the New York Knicks get the festive proceedings underway at Madison Square Garden. Furthermore, the Warriors are scheduled to face the reigning champions, the Denver Nuggets. Apart from these two intriguing matchups, the league has also scheduled Lakers vs Celtics, Heat vs Sixers, and Suns vs Mavs for Christmas. With only a few hours left until the tip-off, fans can kick back and enjoy the NBA with friends and family on the joyous occasion that is Christmas.

sports,David Suggs,2023-09-28T23:54:07+00:00,"Amon-Ra St. Brown was in the midst of a tempest, shrouded in a sea of green with few options around him. The Lions WR had done the hard part, stretching beyond an exasperated Packers defense to trot into the end zone.

But he had a choice to make: rollick in the joy of his sapphire-clad teammates. Or take a leap of faith into the Lambeau Field abyss.

He opted for the latter. St. Brown hurled himself into the green lagoon. Then, he smiled.

St. Brown's impersonation of the Lambeau Leap was one of many high points in a memorable night for Detroit. Fueled by a stout defensive showing, a gritty run game and a bit of fairy dust from the likes of St. Brown, Sam LaPorta and Josh Reynolds, the Lions cruised to a 34-20 win over their hated NFC North rivals, Green Bay.

Thursday's game appeared to be destined to be a showcase of quarterbacking excellence; Jared Goff and Jordan Love have proved themselves to be formidable options under center since taking the reins of their respective offenses.

But it was the supporting cast that proved so pivotal to Thursday's result for Dan Campbell's side. David Montgomery was a nuisance, slipping through crevices to puncture the heart of the Packers' defense. When it wasn't him, it was that receiving corp, made up of unheralded youngsters who have all come up trumps in recent weeks.

As for Love and Co., Thursday's affair was another indication of just how much work there is to be done before they compete for the divisional crown. There were certainly some flits of delight, throws that highlighted just how much talent Love possesses in his golden arm.

But there were low points, too, misshapen efforts that fell harmlessly to the turf, or harmfully into the opposition's hands.

11:19 p.m.: Lions complete yet another fourth down, officially putting the game on ice.

11:12 p.m.: Onside kick spills out of bounds, and it's looking like that might be that. Packers have one timeout remaining but Montgomery's fiery run through the tackles should make that obsolete.

11:11 p.m.: FIELD GOAL! Carlson's try from distance makes the deficit two possessions.

11:08 p.m.: Not so fast. ... A quick three-and-out gives Green Bay a glimmer. That glimmer grows even brighter after an impressive return by Keisean Nixon. Let's see what they can do with 3:30 left.

11:04 p.m.: INTERCEPTION! That's wraps. Love misses his target, instead finding the mitts of Jacobs for his second pick of the day. Strong showing by this Detroit defense. And that should put things to bed.

10:54 p.m.: TOUCHDOWN! Walker's penalty proves vital as Montgomery finds pay dirt from a couple yards out on fourth down. Gutsy call by Campbell. And one that pays off in spades for Detroit, which extends its lead to 17.

Lions 34, Packers 17

10:50 p.m.: Quay Walker's leaps over a blocker on Riley Patterson's field goal attempt, prompting a unsportsmanlike penalty. That will put Detroit on the cusp of another score, pending a Packers defensive rally.

And an impressive toss from Goff into the outstretched hands of Reynolds, as well. The Lions are on the doorstep of the red zone.

10:36 p.m.: TOUCHDOWN! Love scampers into the end zone from short distance to cut that Detroit lead down even more. He got held short of the end zone on the ensuing two-point effort. But Green Bay is firmly back in it.

Lions 27, Packers 17

End of third quarter: Lions 27, Packers 11

Lions 27, Packers 11

10:05 p.m.: Great throw by Love, who threads the needle to find Romeo Doubs to keep the chains moving on fourth down. Packers on the brink of a much-needed touchdown.

9:58 p.m.: This Green Bay offense has to come to life sooner rather than later. If not, this scoreboard could get even more crooked.

Good start to the third frame by the Pack, who find themselves marauding down the field with relative ease in the quarter's opening possession. Every journey began with a single step...

9:20 p.m.: INTERCEPTION! Love's errant pass gets snagged by Jerry Jacobs, who plods 20 yards back to put Detroit on the brink of the promised land. It's been a putrid start for Love and the Green Bay offense so far.

9:15 p.m.: FIELD GOAL! The good times keep on rolling for Detroit, which adds to its lead after another standout drive spearheaded by Goff and Montgomery. The Lions are rolling early.

Lions 17, Packers 3

End of first quarter: Lions 14, Pacers 3

8:51 p.m.: Impressive play-calling for the Lions, who continue to carve their way up the field.

8:50 p.m.: Love has been unable to find a rhythm in his first few possessions. Another gives Detroit another chance to make the Lions' life a living hell.

8:43 p.m.: TOUCHDOWN! Montgomery goes into his right tackle before finding the end zone. Detroit's office os cooking with gan.

Lions 14, Packers 3

8:42 p.m.: Decent scamper by Goff brings Detroit right to the cusp of pay first. Lions are closed to adding a second score.

8:40 p.m.: Since the interception, it's felt as if Goff and the Lions can get anything they want. Gibbs is lightning in a bottle, while Montgomery brings the thunder. This drive just continues to get lengthier and lengthier.

8:34 p.m.: Lions are looking menacing as can be in the trenches. Isaiah Buggs sends Love spiraling with a crunching hit behind the line. The Packers are giving the ball back to the Lions on a three-and-out.

Lions 7, Packers 3

8:27 p.m.: Sam LaPorta gets beyond his marker with a strong move and plods 35 yards down the field. The rookie tight end has been producing at a historic clip so far. And it looks like he's on pace for another standout showing this week.

8:26 p.m.: Jahmyr Gibbs and David Montgomery look a formidable duo in the backfield. Just collaborated to push the Lions forward as they move the chains for the first time today.

8:21 p.m.: FIELD GOAL! Packers open the scoring courtesy of an Anders Carlson field goal. Lions defense held tough, all things considered. Aidan Hutchinson burst through the trenches to send Love tumbling to precipitate the stop.

Packers 3, Lions 0

8:14 p.m.: INTERCEPTION! Rudy Ford swipes Jared Goff's errant pass from the sky and takes it back 16 yards to put the Packers on the cusp of the end zone! That's Goff's third interception in as many games!

8:13 p.m.: Lions starting the game with the ball. Packers defense looking stout as ever through the opening two plays.

8:12 p.m.: Weezy F Baby leading the Packers out onto the field! Wasn't expecting that!

7:53 p.m.: Marshawn Lynch kicking it with Barry Sanders in a pre-game segment. This is what you love to see. It looks like two legends can co-exist.

7:40 p.m.: Aaron Jones' return should offer Love a much-needed reprieve. Green Bay's run game hasn't been all that effective thus far — the Pack are averaging just 3.4 yards per carry so far this year. But Jones is a dynamic force coming out of the backfield, someone capable of carrying an offense on his back for large portions of a game. That's a young QB's dream.

7:30 p.m.: Jordan Love and the Packers heading onto the field ahed of tonight's game! We're about 45 minutes from kickoff at the Pantheon of football excellence, Lambeau Field.

sports,Nick Brinkerhoff,2023-11-11T21:17:00+00:00,"After turning back the clocks last week, it now gets darker earlier for the foreseeable future. That darkness allows us to see the stars on a clear night, so it's only natural to wonder if the pass-catching stars will shine bright in Week 10 of the NFL season. We already know Tee Higgins and Nico Collins are OUT, while Justin Jefferson, Ja'Marr Chase, and T.J. Hockenson are among the other star pass-catchers beaten up heading into the week. Can we expect them on the field when the action kicks off Sunday?

Below, we'll give you the latest news on these ailing pass-catchers and break down how their injuries could potentially affect the Week 10 fantasy landscape.

WEEK 10 INJURY UPDATES: Early WRs | RBs

Is Justin Jefferson playing Week 10?

UPDATE: The Vikings will not activate Jefferson before Sunday's game and have officially ruled him OUT, according to NFL Network's Tom Pelissero.

Jefferson (hamstring) is officially listed as ""questionable"" for Sunday's game against the Saints. Kickoff is slated for 1 p.m. ET, but fantasy owners won't have to wait long for news on the star receiver. In order to be eligible to play, Jefferson will need to be activated by 4 p.m. ET on Saturday. Earlier in the week head coach Kevin O'Connell said that it would be ""a little aggressive"" for Jefferson to get back on the field this week. However, the receiver's three straight limited practices were enough for the team to at least weigh the decision, but thankfully, an early answer awaits.

WEEK 10 FANTASY ADVICE:

Sleepers | Busts | Projections | Start 'em, sit 'em

Jefferson's fantasy outlook is always through the roof, but it will be interesting to see if that changes with Josh Dobbs under center instead of Kirk Cousins. In addition, K.J. Osborn (concussion) is also listed as ""questionable,"" though his status steadily improved throughout the week from DNP on Wednesday to full practice on Friday. If Jefferson is back, he's a must-start. If Jefferson is out but Osborn returns, both Osborn and Jordan Addison are worth using.

WEEK 10 PPR RANKINGS:

QBs | RBs | WRs | TEs | D/STs | Kickers

Is Ja'Marr Chase playing Week 10?

UPDATE: ESPN's Jeremy Fowler reported late Saturday that the Bengals are ""hopeful"" that Chase will play against Houston, but they won't know for sure until after a pre-game workout.

UPDATE 2: Chase is officially ACTIVE.

Chase (back) appears ready to take his status down to kickoff. According to The Athletic's Dianna Russini, the Bengals' star receiver will work out on Sunday morning and his status will be determined afterward. Chase put a scare into the fantasy community on Wednesday when he was listed as a DNP, but after logging back-to-back limited practices, there is a lot more optimism heading into Sunday. With Tee Higgins (hamstring) already ruled out, Cincinnati will be hoping Chase can feel healthy enough to play when they host the Texans at 1 p.m. ET on Sunday.

The Bengals, despite getting a win over the Bills last Sunday, are a beaten-down bunch. Their defense will also be without a prominent edge rusher, Sam Hubbard, complicating matters for a team hoping to stack wins as they compete for an AFC North crown. On the bright side, Joe Burrow appears to be finally healthy and should have no problems targeting Tyler Boyd, Trenton Irwin, and Andrei Iosivas in the passing game. If Chase does end up suiting up, fantasy owners should enjoy an even larger workload than the receiver already had. If he's out, Boyd is a must-start, and you can try one of Cincinnati's secondary receivers in deep leagues.

WEEK 10 STANDARD RANKINGS:

QBs | RBs | WRs | TEs | D/STs | Kickers

Is T.J. Hockenson playing Week 10?

UPDATE: NFL Network's Ian Rapoport reported Sunday morning that Hockenson is expected to play against New Orleans.

UPDATE 2: Hockenson is officially ACTIVE.

Hockenson (ribs) is listed as ""questionable"" for Week 10, but he's already said he plans to play on Sunday. The tight end has dealt with his fair share of injury woes this season, however, he's yet to miss a game. After turning in three limited practices this week, we'll trust that Hockenson is ready to go, especially since he continued to play through the ailment in Week 9 as a big part of the offense with Josh Dobbs under center.

As long as Hockenson is playing, he's not being benched in any fantasy format. The tight end projects as a top option at the position and remains the Vikings' leader in targets with 80 on the season. Dobbs enjoyed targeting the tight ends in Arizona and continued that trend in his Minnesota debut. The floor for Hockenson is equivalent to that of a rooftop bar.

WEEK 10 DFS: DK lineup | FD lineup | Best values | Best stacks

Is Curtis Samuel playing Week 10?

UPDATE: Samuel is officially ACTIVE.

Samuel (toe) is expected to play on Sunday when the Commanders take on the Seahawks at 4:25 p.m. ET, according to ESPN's Jeremy Fowler. The receiver was limited in practice thanks to the toe injury that has plagued him since leaving Week 8's game against the Eagles, but barring a setback, he will return to action this weekend.

The receiver was working his way into flex territory with a couple of good performances before picking up the injury. However, we wouldn't consider him to be worthy of a fantasy start this week unless you're in a bind. It's unclear whether Samuel will regain the same workload or if he'll be playing in limited action as he works his way back. Jamison Crowder emerged in Samuel's absence and Jahan Dotson has seen his production drastically increase, as well. The wait-and-see approach is the preferred one heading into Week 10.","Fantasy Injury Updates Week 10: News on Justin Jefferson, Ja'Marr Chase, T.J.

sports,Tyler Sullivan,2023-12-01T22:52:36+00:00,"Week 13 is in full swing and teams are starting to truly jockey for playoff position as we rocket down the stretch run of the regular season. Of course, with it being so late in the year, injuries continue to be a predominant storyline to monitor heading into each slate and this weekend is no different. Specifically, the quarterback position in Cleveland has taken an interesting turn with veteran Joe Flacco named the starter against the Rams with Dorian Thompson-Robinson ruled out with a concussion. And that's just one situation that we'll be monitoring below.

Here's a look at all of the final injury reports for Week 13.

All NFL odds via SportsLine Consensus odds.

Chargers (-5.5) at Patriots

Allen made his return to practice on a limited basis on Friday and is officially questionable for Sunday's matchup in New England due to a quad injury. Meanwhile, Pipkins was also limited on Friday.

The Patriots will be down a couple of wide receivers as Douglas and Boutte have been ruled out after not practicing on Friday. For Douglas, he missed the entire week due to a concussion he suffered against the Giants, while Boutte was downgraded on the injury report on Thursday and missed back-to-back days due to an illness on top of his shoulder injury.

Lions (-4) at Saints

The Lions just designated Hooker for return, who has been rehabbing a torn ACL he suffered at Tennessee last year, this week so the rookie quarterback was not expected to be activated this week. Meanwhile, Anzalone did not practice at all this week, so his prospects look bleak for Week 13. As for Jackson, he was a full participant on both Thursday and Friday.

Head coach Dennis Allen told reporters Friday that despite Olave being a full participant in Friday's practice he is still in concussion protocol though has a chance to play. The wideout still has another hurdle to pass to be cleared to play on Sunday so his status is still very much up in the air.

Falcons (-2) at Jets

Atlanta is relatively healthy coming into this matchup. Hollins, who injured his ankle in Week 9, participated on a limited basis every day this week, which is encouraging for his prospects to play on Sunday. As for Hughes, he practiced fully all week after suffering a hand injury last weekend against the Saints. Linebacker Nate Landman (thigh) missed practice on Wednesday but will play vs. New York.

Rodgers was once again limited in practice but, as expected, will not be activated this week and will be sidelined as he continues his recovery from a torn Achilles just a few months ago. Meanwhile, Cook popped up on the injury report due to a shoulder injury, but head coach Robert Saleh told reporters Friday that the back should be fine.

Cardinals at Steelers (-5.5)

Despite missing the entire week of practice, the Cardinals are holding out hope for Brown to play by listing him as questionable. McBride is also questionable after being limited on Thursday and Friday, but told reporters that he's ""good to go.""

Pittsburgh has listed Adams as its lone player with a game designation to wrap up the week. Safety Minkah Fitzpatrick (hamstring) practiced fully throughout the week, carries no designation, and told reporters Friday that he will play this weekend.

Colts (-1) at Titans

Colts : CB JuJu Brents (quad), RB Jonathan Taylor (thumb) OUT

: CB JuJu Brents (quad), RB Jonathan Taylor (thumb) OUT Titans: WR Treylon Burks (concussion) QUESTIONABLE

Indianapolis ruled out Brents and Taylor after they both missed the entire week of practice. For Taylor, he underwent surgery on his thumb this week and is expected to miss at least a couple of weeks, which will thrust Zack Moss into a more prominent role in the Colts backfield.

Burks is the only Titan to have an injury designation entering the weekend, but the wideout was a full participant in Friday's practice. However, he will need to clear the final stages of concussion protocol in order to play.

Dolphins (-9.5) at Commanders

Every player who the Dolphins listed as questionable for Sunday's game against Washington was able to practice on a limited basis on Friday. That includes Cotton and Lamm, who both were DNPs earlier in the week. Rookie running back De'Von Achane was a full participant in Friday's practice and head coach Mike McDaniel said he will play this week after missing time with a knee injury.

Washington could be without its starting center this weekend as it plays host to Miami. Larsen, who missed Wednesday's practice due to a knee injury, was limited on Friday and is officially listed as questionable. Meanwhile, the Commanders will play Week 13 without Forbes Jr., who has been sidelined since suffering an elbow injury against the Giants in Week 11. Head coach Ron Rivera called the injury ""significant"" earlier this week.

Broncos at Texans (-3)

Denver's lone player with an injury designation for Week 13 is Mathis, who did not practice Friday after being limited on Thursday. Outside of him, the Broncos are healthy heading into this matchup with Houston. Wideouts Jerry Jeudy (groin) and Marvin Mims Jr. (hamstring) were both full participants on Friday after being limited on Thursday.

Dell logged back-to-back days as a limited participant in practice to end the week and is officially questionable. Brown is also questionable but did not practice Friday due to a knee injury.

Panthers at Buccaneers (-5.5)

Carolina may be down two tight ends this weekend as the club has ruled out Hurst and is listing Tremble as doubtful. This is the third straight game Hurst will miss. The team will also be without Bell and will likely look to rookie Alex Cook to start. Meanwhile, corner CJ Henderson (concussion) was a full participant on Friday and carries no designation heading into the weekend.

Tampa Bay is pretty banged up coming into Week 13, particularly on the defense side of the ball. The Bucs will be without key pieces David, Dean, and White when they play host to Carolina. Meanwhile, Godwin did not practice Friday after being added to the injury report on Thursday with a neck injury.

49ers (-3) at Eagles

Each of the 49ers' questionable players were limited Friday and did not practice the previous two days. Armstead has stated that he will suit up on Sunday.

Philadelphia saw the return of tight end Goedert at practice on Friday. He was limited for the session and officially listed as doubtful after practicing for the first time since suffering a fractured forearm against the Cowboys on Nov. 5. As for Cox, he is questionable despite not practicing Friday due to a groin injury.

Browns at Rams (-3.5)

Browns : QB Dorian Thompson-Robinson (concussion), WR Marquise Goodwin (concussion), CB Denzel Ward (shoulder) OUT; C Nick Harris (knee) QUESTIONABLE

: QB Dorian Thompson-Robinson (concussion), WR Marquise Goodwin (concussion), CB Denzel Ward (shoulder) OUT; C Nick Harris (knee) QUESTIONABLE Rams: S Quentin Lake (hamstring) OUT; OLB Michael Hoecht (knee) QUESTIONABLE

The Browns have officially ruled out Thompson-Robinson due to a concussion he suffered last week against Denver, which will thrust veteran Joe Flacco in as the starter for Cleveland in Los Angeles.

For the Rams, Hoecht didn't practice the last two days after being a limited participant on Wednesday.

Chiefs (-6) at Packers

Kansas City is relatively healthy coming into Week 13. McKinnon was a limited participant on both Thursday and Friday, so his prospects of playing on Sunday appear to be trending in a positive direction. As for Bolton, he is still on IR and working his way back from a wrist injury.

Green Bay will be without Jones as the running back continues to deal with a knee injury. Reed returned to practice Friday after missing both Wednesday and Thursday due to a chest injury, while Alexander -- who has missed six of the Packers 11 games this year -- was limited throughout the week.

Bengals at Jaguars (-8.5), Monday

Bengals : CB Cam Taylor-Britt (quad/ankle), D'Ante Smith (knee), Jay Tufele (illness) OUT

: CB Cam Taylor-Britt (quad/ankle), D'Ante Smith (knee), Jay Tufele (illness) OUT Jaguars: CB Tyson Campbell (hamstring), RB Travis Etienne (ribs), TE Brenton Strange (foot), TE Luke Farrell (toe) QUESTIONABLE

The Bengals got good news on the injury front ahead of Monday's game against the Jaguars. Wide receiver Tee Higgins (hamstring/ankle) and linebacker Logan Wilson (ankle/foot) are set to play, according to head coach Zac Taylor. Higgins and Wilson were full participants in practice. Cornerback Cam Taylor-Britt hurt his foot in practice and is out.

For the Jaguars, Travis Etienne (ribs) is also expected to play, Doug Pederson told reporters, despite the running back being limited in practice all week.

In addition to sacking Daniel Jones 11 times, Seattle’s defense forced New York’s QB to commit three turnovers — a fumble and two interceptions, none more notable than rookie Devon Witherspoon's 97-yard pick-6 that turned the game on its ear.

With the win, the Seahawks move to 3-1 on the season, including a perfect 2-0 record away from home. The Giants drop to 1-3 on the season and have been outscored 64-3 in two primetime home losses.

Final: Seahawks 24, Giants 3

11:18 p.m.: It's a wrap at MetLife Stadium. The Seahawks advance to 3-1 on the year while the Giants fall to 1-3.

New York has been dominated at home twice this season now, as this performance follows a 40-0 blowout in Week 1 on ""Sunday Night Football."" Daniel Jones' career mark in primetime falls to 1-13 and 0-3 this season.

11:09 p.m.: TURNOVER ON DOWNS! Daniel Jones is sacked for an 11th time as Seattle takes back over at the New York 35-yard line.

Geno Smith's night appears to be done as Drew Lock is back in for the Seahawks.

11:06 p.m: Daniel Jones is back under center for New York, which will look to drive and score to at least lessen the damage on the scoreboard.

11:04 p.m.: FIELD GOAL! The turnover leads to three points for the Seahawks, who get a 34-yard field goal from Jason Myers. It's a three-touchdown lead for Seattle now with just over five minutes to play.

Seahawks 24, Giants 3

10:59 p.m.: INTERCEPTION! The nightmarish game for Daniel Jones continues as he commits his third turnover of the game, a pass intercepted by Seahawks safety Quandre Diggs.

After being sacked nine times and committing three turnovers, Jones may not have much more time on the field tonight.

10:56 p.m.: New York forces a three-and-out to get the ball back and on the first offensive play, Daniel Jones is sacked again.

Jones has now been sacked nine times in the game. It's a rough showing considering Seattle entered the week with just five sacks on the season.

10:48 p.m.: …And ANOTHER sack.

Daniel Jones has now been sacked eight times in the game and New York will be forced to punt as it faces fourth-and-31.

Fans are starting to leave the Meadowlands as it's been all Seahawks tonight.

10:45 p.m.: Daniel Jones has now been sacked seven times in the game.

Bobby Wagner gets Jones again, setting up second-and-28 for the Giants, who were already at a disadvantage thanks to a penalty on first down.

End of third quarter: Seahawks 21, Giants 3

10:33 p.m.: PICK SIX! In the worst possible outcome for the Giants, Devon Witherspoon sits on an underneath route and intercepts Daniel Jones, returning the pick 97 yards for a touchdown. The PAT is good!

What could have been a one-possession game is now a three-score game. And Daniel Jones now has two turnovers in this one.

Seahawks 21, Giants 3

10:30 p.m.: The Giants just pulled off one of their biggest plays of the night.

On fourth-and-1 from Seattle's 16-yard line, Brian Daboll elects to keep the offense on the field instead of electing for three points. Out of play action, Daniel Jones rolls out and gets 11 yards to bring New York within five yards of its first touchdown of the night.

10:22 p.m.: A 53-yard field goal attempt from Jason Myers is no good!

Seattle fails to add to its lead and New York gets another chance to cut into its deficit, this time, with field position that's slightly more favorable. The Giants will take over at their on 34-yard line.

10:16 p.m.: New York's drive ends about as quickly as it began as it is three-and-out for the Giants.

Daniel Jones is sacked for a sixth time this evening. This time it's eight-time Pro Bowler Bobby Wagner. The excitement at MetLife Stadium is gone once again as New York will punt from its own 12.

10:12 p.m.: TURNOVER ON DOWNS! New York gives its fans something to be excited about as its defense holds up on fourth down thanks to a major PBU from LB Micah McFadden.

The Giants keep the Seahawks off the board and take over at their own 15-yard line.

10:03 p.m.: The second half is underway and Geno Smith is back on the field for the Seahawks.

Seattle fans can breathe a sigh of relief as its top signal-caller will be back under center and avoided serious injury.

Halftime: Seahawks 14, Giants 3

9:47 p.m.: The half closes with New York committing its third and fourth special teams penalties of the night, giving Seattle the ball back after it intended to punt on fourth-and-4.

As the Seahawks get the ball back, they run the clock out as boos begin to rain down on the Giants from their home crowd.

Making matters worse, Seattle is set to receive the second-half kickoff.

9:37 p.m: TOUCHDOWN! RB Kenneth Walker III punches it in from one yard out. It's his second touchdown of the 2023 season.

The play doesn't come without extracurriculars, however, as it is followed by a scrum between linemen. The result is offsetting penalties from Seahawks G Anthony Bradford and Giants DE Leonard Williams.

Seahawks 14, Giants 3.

9:35 p.m.: Drew Lock is balling.

Lock connects with Noah Fant for a 51-yard completion that has the Seahawks on the 1-yard line. Credit to Fant, as he used his footwork to toe the sideline and turn the completion to a big play.

9:30 p.m.: At the two-minute warning, Drew Lock has gotten the Seahawks to their own 48-yard line. Lock will continue to lead the Seahawks' two-minute drill.

Geno Smith is out of the medical tent and headed to the locker room for further testing on his knee. His status for the remainder of the game is questionable.

The Seahawks will look to add some cushion to their lead as they will also receive the ball to open the second half.

9:26 p.m.: Geno Smith's displeasure with the tackle from earlier is beginning to make sense. Seattle's QB has been in the medical tent with an undetermined injury.

Drew Lock will be taking snaps until there is more clarity on Smith's status moving forward.

9:23 p.m.: FIELD GOAL! Graham Gano connects on a 55-yarder to get the Giants on the board. Since the beginning of last season, Gano is 10 of 11 on attempts that are 50 yards or longer.

Seahawks 7, Giants 3

9:11 p.m.: We've got some fireworks on the field.

Geno Smith catches his own batted pass and on the ensuing run, is pulled down out of bounds by Giants LB Isaiah Simmons. Smith, clearly taking exception to the hit, comes back on the field and has words for S Xavier McKinney.

New York almost forces a turnover on third down but still gets off the field. Smith appears to be slightly hobbled after the hit.

End of first quarter: Seahawks 7, Giants 0

8:56 p.m.: TOUCHDOWN! As time expires in the first quarter, Geno Smith rolls out and finds DK Metcalf, who hauls in his second touchdown of the year.

The extra point is good! And Seattle turns a turnover into seven points.

Seahawks 7, Giants 0

8:54 p.m.: FUMBLE! After evading one sack, Daniel Jones is sacked at the Giants 15-yard line by Mario Edwards, who also forces the ball out.

Seattle recovers and returns the fumble to New York's 7-yard line, where it will look to score for the first time tonight.

8:47 p.m.: Flags… flags everywhere.

Four straight plays with a penalty for the Seahawks means their drive officially starts with a first-and-20. As the game approaches the two-minute mark of the first quarter, neither team has been able to strike offensively.

8:35 p.m.: Jamal Adams has been ruled out for the remainder of the game.

8:34 p.m.: And a few more bizarre plays. It's a three-and-out for Seattle, which sees its drive end courtesy of a sack from Kayvon Thibodeaux.

The Giants muff the punt from Michael Dixon but avoid a crisis by recovering it. New York will take the floor for its second offensive drive from Seattle's 34-yard line.

8:28 p.m.: We've got our first bizarre play of the night.

Seahawks RB Kenneth Walker III runs for a touchdown after he isn't ruled down but the play is called back. Instead of a 73-yard touchdown run, it's a two-yard loss.

8:25 p.m.: TURNOVER ON DOWNS! On fourth-and-1 from the Seahawks' 27-yard line, Daniel Jones is stopped in his tracks as he attempts a QB sneak.

After an impressive defensive stand, Geno Smith and the Seattle offense will take the field for the first time tonight.

8:22 p.m.: Jamal Adams' return to the field may end up being short-lived.

Adams was on the wrong end of a knee to the helmet and appeared to be shaken up as he needed some assistance getting off the field. More updates to come on Adams' status.

8:15 p.m.: Seattle wins the coin toss and defers to the second half.

New York elects for a fair catch on the kickoff, meaning Daniel Jones and company will get their night started on the 25-yard line.

Pregame

7:50 p.m.: It's officially official.

Jamal Adams is back on the field warming up for the Seahawks, surely a welcome sight for the 12s.

6:55 p.m.: Saquon Barkley has officially been ruled inactive for the Giants.

Joining Barkley on the inactive list are S Bobby McCain, S Gervarrius Owens, T Andrew Thomas and DL Jordon Riley.

Inactive for the Seahawks: CB Coby Bryant, CB Tre Brown, CB Artie Burns, LB Nick Bellore, G McClendon Curtis, T Charles Cross and G Ben Brown.

6:25 p.m.: With less than two hours remaining until kickoff, there's still no concrete update on the availability of Giants RB Saquon Barkley, who is currently listed as doubtful with a high ankle sprain.

Barring a last-minute change, it doesn't appear as though No. 26 will be suiting up for New York.

6 p.m.: Jamal Adams is back!

For the first time since Week 1 of the 2022 NFL season, the three-time All-Pro safety will take the field for the Seahawks. Almost poetically, Adams makes his return to the field in the place he called home for the first three years of his career as a member of the Jets.

sports,Edward Sutelan,2023-11-05T23:47:00+00:00,"Folks, the Bengals are back.

When Cincinnati began the season 1-3, including a pair of blowout losses in which they scored just three points in each game against the Browns and Titans, it sure seemed Joe Burrow's calf injury would wind up holding the team back in what appeared to be one of their best chances to finally win that elusive Super Bowl.

Since that loss to Tennessee, it's been the Bengals of old. And that team showed up again on ""Sunday Night Football"" against the Bills. Cincinnati jumped out to an first-half, 21-7 lead against Buffalo, and the defense did the rest, limiting the Bills to just 11 points the rest of the game as the Bengals won their fourth straight, beating the Bills 24-18.

MORE: Is Damar Hamlin playing vs. Bengals on SNF?

Fans expected this to be an offensive showdown against two premier quarterbacks. And after the first three drives of the game, it sure appeared that's how it would go. The Bengals scored an opening-drive touchdown on just nine plays, matched quickly by a Bills' scoring drive of seven plays and 3:15. The Bengals re-took the lead on a 5:28 scoring drive to wrap up the first.

From there, however, ""Mad Scientist"" Lou Anarumo's defense kept Josh Allen and the Bills off balance offensively for most of the remainder of the game. The next four drives of the half went punt, interception, punt, end of half.

Burrow and the Bengals, meanwhile, hit a few bumps in Buffalo territory, but scored a touchdown on their final drive of of the first half to take a two-score lead into the locker room. Buffalo picked up a field goal on the first drive of the second half and held the Bengals to just three points in the second half, but it wasn't until 3:32 left that Allen finally got the Bills back into the end zone, with a 17-yard strike to Diggs and a subsequent 2-point try to make it a six-point game.

The Bengals had the ball back with 3:32 left, but put the trust in No. 9, having him start the put-away drive with a 32-yard deep shot to Tyler Boyd to put the Bengals quickly in Buffalo territory. Joe Mixon ran three times to pick up the final first down needed to allow Burrow to kneel out the contest.

In a highly anticipated rematch between Allen and Burrow, it was the Bengals' signal-caller that once again came out the better in both the win column and the statsheet. Burrow completed 31-of-44 passes for 348 yards with a pair of touchdowns, while Allen went 26-for-38 with 258 passing yards, one passing touchdown and an interception. He also rushed eight times for 44 yards and another score.

With the win, the Bengals move into the final wild-card spot behind the Steelers and Browns, while the Bills are bumped down to the outside-looking-in of the AFC playoff race.

11:19 p.m.: Mixon rushes for four yards to bring up a third-and-4 at the Bills' 37, and bring up the two-minute warning. A first down will win the game for the Bengals, since Buffalo cannot stop the clock. A stop on third will bring up an interesting decision for Zac Taylor and Cincinnati.

11:17 p.m.: Mixon rushes for two yards after the big gain, and the Bills use their final timeout with 2:37 left.

11:17 p.m.: Feels like a time to run the ball, right? Well, not to the Bengals, who trust Burrow to air out a deep pass to Boyd for 32 yards to the Bills 43.

10:50 p.m.: Irv Smith drops a pass on first down, but who else but Higgins makes a leaping grab for nine yards over the first down marker. Before the third-and-1 play, the Bengals call a timeout, their second of the half.

10:46 p.m.: A crucial turnover this late in the game. Allen hits Kincaid up the middle, but as the tight end is flipped up in the air, he loses his grasp on the ball, and the Bengals recover it at the Cincinnati 13.

10:44 p.m.: The Bills try some trickery on first down with a lateral and flea flicker, but Allen fires it empty down the right side. He then scrambles for nine before he's stopped by Mike Hilton. He sneaks for a yard as the Bills pick up the first at the Cincinnati 22.

Third quarter

10:40 p.m.: Back-to-back plays with Cook, with him rushing for three then catching a pass for six to bring up third-and-1 at the Bengals' 35. Allen then sneaks to the left side to pick up three and the first down to bring the third quarter to an end.

10:39 p.m.: Allen is putting on the superhero cape to start the drive, powering his way for a 10-yard run to start the drive then hitting Kincaid for 11 yards to quickly get the Bills back into Cincinnati territory at the 44.

10:36 p.m.: The Bengals try for it on fourth down, but while Burrow connects with Sample, he's brought down three yards shy of the marker. The Bills take over at their own 35.

10:27 p.m.: Allen is flushed out of the pocket and tries to pick up yardage, but he's brought down by Trey Hendrickson for only a yard. Bills will have to punt the ball away.

10:26 p.m.: Allen throws a quick pass out to Cooks for four, then misses a quick strike to Diggs on the left side. Third-and-6 coming up. Bills wind up using their first timeout with 5:54 left in the half and the play clock down to three seconds.

10:22 p.m.: Burrow again looks Chase's way, and again comes up empty. He has just three catches for nine yards on seven targets. Robbins' punt spots the Bills at their own 9.

10:21 p.m.: Burrow goes for the deep shot to Chase, but the throw is just a bit short, and the contact with Dane Jackson breaks up the pass. Mixon then catches a dump-off pass, but is brought down for a loss of a yard. Third-and-11 coming up.

10:20 p.m.: Higgins catches a short pass, but makes a few players miss, moving all the way up to the Cincinnati 43.

10:10 p.m.: Allen rifles a pass to Diggs over the head of Nick Scott for a 15-yard pickup to the Bengals' 33. He dumps it off to Cook on the next play for a pickup of eight. Cook rushes for seven to get the first down and move into the red zone for the first time since the Bills' opening drive, setting up Buffalo at the Cincinnati 17 with a first down.

9:37 p.m.: Bengals decide to go for it, and it works out. Chase sneaks past the defender, catches a pass from Burrow and takes it 11 yards to the Bills' 25. That takes this game to the two-minute warning.

9:36 p.m.: The Bengals get within a yard, with Burrow firing a short pass over the middle to Boyd, who picks up nine yards to set up a fourth-and-1, and another decision for Cincinnati at the Bills' 36.

9:16 p.m.: Hudson remains active in the passing game, catching a nine-yard pass from Burrow to start the drive. The Bills use their first timeout with 8:17 left as the Bengals prepare for a second-and-1 from the Bills' 23.

9:15 p.m.: Allen makes his first mistake of the game. Taylor-Britt leaps in front of Gabe Davis and picks up his third interception of the season (Allen's ninth of the year). That will give the Bengals excellent field position at the Bills' 32.

9:14 p.m.: Allen starts the drive trying again to connect with Harty on a deep shot, but it's overthrown.

9:11 p.m.: Burrow clearly wanted to go for it, but the Bengals decide to punt. Brad Robbins boots it up, and Hardy fair catches the ball at the Bills' 12.

9:10 p.m.: Brutal false start penalty by Alex Cappa backs up the Bengals, and while Burrow connects with Drew Sample for six, the Bengals are still two yards shy of the marker. Fourth-and-2 coming up, and a decision for Cincinnati at the Bills' 48.

9:08 p.m.: Bengals keep leaning on the running game with Mixon picking up two, then Williams rushing for five to bring up a third-and-3 at the Bills' 49.

9:05 p.m.: The Bengals' offense picks up right where it left off. Burrow starts the third drive by firing a quick pass to Higgins on a curl route for a pickup of 12 to the 34.

9:03 p.m.: Trenton Irwin returns the kick to the Bengals' 22.

9:02 p.m.: Allen goes for a deep shot, but he can't connect with Deonte Hardy. Offensive holding is declined, and the Bills will be the first to punt tonight.

9:01 p.m.: Bills now facing their longest third-down of the day. Cook lost a yard, then Allen is chased out of the pocket and just gets a throw off to Kincaid before he's sacked. Third-and-11 coming up.

9 p.m.: Allen tries to connect with Trent Sherfield, but Cam Taylor-Britt is called for pass interference. That will move the Bills up 17 yards to the Bills' 44.

First quarter

8:56 p.m.: James Cook gets his first rush of the game, picking up two yards. That will bring this quarter to an end.

8:55 p.m.: Bills will take the ball at the 25 on the fair catch at the 2. Just 0:35 left in a high-scoring first quarter.

8:52 p.m. Bengals scoring play: Hand-off to Mixon, and he bulldozes his way up the middle for the 2-yard touchdown to give Cincinnati the lead again. Bengals 14, Bills 7

8:51 p.m.: Cincinnati tries twice to get it to Chase, first with Chase being tackled at the 2 on a wide receiver screen and then a leaping grab for Chase in the end zone, where he can't quite hold on after the catch.

8:49 p.m.: Bengals just miss out on another touchdown. Burrow escapes the pocket, then gets the ball out to Higgins who dives for the pylon. However, Higgins is ruled out at the 2.

8:48 p.m.: Make it back-to-back firsts for the Bengals, as Hudson gets his second catch of the day, this one for 13 yards to the Bills' 14.

8:47 p.m.: Bengals stay perfect on third downs, with Tyler Boyd catching a pass in front of the sideline for 15 yards up to the Bills' 27.

8:46 p.m.: Bengals have their longest third-down attempt of the day. Mixon rushes for no gain, and Burrow can't connect with Smith after he gets flushed out of the pocket. Third-and-10 coming up.

8:44 p.m.: Andrei Iosivas is getting involved in the passing game after back-to-back weeks with a touchdown. He catches a nine-yard pass after Burrow rolls out to his right. Mixon then picks up the first by rushing for three yards to the Bills' 42.

8:44 p.m.: Burrow tries to connect with Ja'Marr Chase, but the throw is broken up. However, Burrow is roughed on the play, and the Bengals move up 15 yards.

8:43 p.m.: Williams with a solid return, moving up to the Cincinnati 31 to start the drive.

8:39 p.m. Bills scoring play: Allen rushes in for two yards, and is flagged for taunting as he runs in through the right side with 6:03 left in the first quarter. All offense so far. Bengals 7, Bills 7

Two drives. Two touchdowns.

8:35 p.m.: Stop if you've heard this before: Allen to Stefon Diggs. The dynamic duo connect for nine yards up the middle on a third-and-5, then they connect again for a huge 34-yard strike, with Diggs catching a short pass and carving through the left sideline down to the Bengals' 37.

8:27 p.m.: Much ado was made about the tight end position last week when Irv Smith Jr. fumbled in the red zone. Today, the first tight end to get involved in the game is Tanner Hudson, who catches a six-yard pass and gets the first down.

8:26 p.m.: Williams gets the first two carries of the game by a Bengal, and he rushes right up the middle for seven yards on first down and then a pickup of one trying to bounce outside.

8:24 p.m.: Burrow starts the game with a quick checkdown pass to Joe Mixon, who takes it up the field eight yards. He then catches another short pass and takes it up 15 yards to the Bengals' 47.

8:23 p.m.: Trayveon Williams returns the ball out to the 24, where the Bengals will start on offense.

8:20 p.m.: The Bengals won the toss, and decided to take the ball on offense to start the game.

7:56 p.m.: Before the game, former punter Kevin Huber and former long-snapper Clark Harris are recognized on the jumbotron. The two are Cincinnati legends, with Huber having played in the most games as a Bengal (216 games) and Harris ranking fourth (202 games). The two are the rulers of the jungle for the game.

sports,Nick Brinkerhoff,2023-11-07T22:09:00+00:00,"Tuesday night's NHL national games feature an Original Six matchup at Madison Square Garden in addition to a battle between the team that left and the team that took its place. The Rangers and Red Wings will face off at the world's most famous arena as both squads have jumped out to hot starts in the new season. Dylan Larkin is a game-time decision for the Motor City while injuries to the Blueshirts' Adam Fox, Filip Chytil and Igor Shesterkin are making sure some of this matchup's biggest stars will not be watching in uniform. Regardless, there is still plenty of star power on Broadway in what should feature plenty of offense.

In the late game, the Devils return to Colorado -- the place they left in order to move to New Jersey -- for a showdown with the Avalanche. Again, injuries are a big part of the storyline here, thanks to Jack Hughes and Nico Hischier out until further notice. But just because injuries might take some of the juice out of these games doesn't mean that SuperDraft isn't giving us plenty of reasons to care. There are some snazzy looking props out there for us to make our bottom line look at lot better than it did earlier this morning.

Best NHL prop bets today: SuperDraft player prop picks for Wednesday

*10x potential payout if users parlay all four correct picks

1. Artemi Panarin, LW, Rangers vs. Red Wings — OVER 3 shots on goal

Panarin has registered at least three shots on goal in nine of 11 games this season, going over three in six of those contests. The winger has been up to his usual antics in the new season, but is also seeing some extra ice time under new head coach Peter Laviolette. The Rangers head into this matchup with a makeshift lineup thanks to those injuries that is forcing them to adjust. The absences of Fox and Chytil are a big deal, however, as Panarin loses Fox, who quarterbacks the power play, and Chytil, who centered his line at even strength. Panarin is still all over the ice for the Blueshirts though and is even seeing 18.8 percent of his shifts start in the offensive zone, a welcome sight after the last two seasons with Gerard Gallant behind the bench. The Red Wings have allowed the 11th most SOG this season (371) and the fourth most power play opportunities (46). If the Rangers can play with the man advantage, Panarin should hit this number with ease, but he's enough of a factor at even strength that we like the OVER here anyway.

2. Daniel Sprong, RW, Red Wings @ Rangers — OVER 2.5 shots on goal

Despite not being featured in the top six, Sprong is holding down the fort on the third line, averaging five shot attempts per game through the first 12. He's hit the over in five straight, with 18 SOG compared to just eight combined for his two linemates. Sprong does see some work on the second power play unit, but is clearly willing to fire a lot of pucks at the net with his shoot-first mentality on the third line. With the Rangers still figuring out how to deal with the loss of Fox, there should be some opportunities there for Sprong to find at least three shots tonight.

3. Jesper Bratt, LW, Devils @ Avalanche — UNDER 0.5 assists

Bratt comes into Tuesday night's action with seven goals and 11 assists in 11 games. The winger came firing out of the gate, but the outlook has changed for the Devils in recent days after losing the superstar center Hughes to injury. Hughes went down after slamming into the boards against the Blues, forcing New Jersey to change things on the fly. The changes have directly impacted Bratt, who was featured on the top line alongside Hughes. With fellow center Hischier also out with an injury, leaving the Devils fairly weak down the middle and trusting Michael McLeod to hold down the fort in between Bratt and Tyler Toffoli. As a result, Bratt has been held without an assist in each of the last two games for a team that's missing a key contributor on offense. And it'll need him to look to score rather than play the role of playmaker. Until the Devils figure things out, we can't trust this team to do anything positive in the offensive zone.

4. Cale Makar, D, Avalanche vs. Devils — OVER 2.5 shots on goal

Over this number in each of the last two, fans will want to see Makar shoot the puck a little more after going under in five of the previous six before his recent hot streak. Facing a Devils team that is reeling thanks to injuries should help Makar's cause with Colorado able to control the play in the Mile High City. He's the team's top defenseman and a key piece to their power play. Barring something unforeseen, Makar will have plenty of opportunities to find three shots before the 60 minutes on the clock run out. And with 5.9 shot attempts per game, it's only a matter of time before they start finding their way on goal.","Best NHL prop bets tonight: Artemi Panarin, Cale Makar highlight top parlay picks for Rangers-Red Wings, Devils-Avalanche",https://www.sportingnews.com/us/nhl/news/best-nhl-prop-bets-tonight-panarin-makar-tuesday/67d9b5e55d061181d7805c01,Sporting News
sports,Ansuman Abhisek,2023-12-21T23:41:30+00:00,"Autosport has revealed its annual list of the 2023’s Top 50 drivers. The renowned motorsports publishing brand has continued the tradition since 2002, and every year, the announcement creates some suspense within the racing community. Highlighting the 50 standout performers in motorsports for the year, Autosport has included several NASCAR drivers in the prestigious list.

America’s Favorite Video Today

William Byron leads the list of NASCAR drivers with a 12th-place ranking as Kyle Larson and 2023 Cup Series champion Ryan Blaney join him. The scarcity of NASCAR drivers in the rankings has raised some eyebrows. With the year producing numerous cases of NASCAR drivers standing out with their consistency and skills behind the steering wheel, let us look at some of the major exclusions from Autosport’s Top 50 Drivers of 2023.

1. Chris Buescher

ADVERTISEMENT Article continues below this ad

RFK Racing found a fresh breath of motivation this year. Since Brad Keselowski arrived in 2022, the team has continued evolving on and off the track. While Keselowski has certainly instilled his experience and winning mentality within the team, he failed to produce a race win in 2023. Instead, it was Chris Buescher who outshone the Cup Series veteran with his best-ever season in NASCAR’s premier competition.

Chris Buescher ended his season with three wins, nine top-5s, and 17 top-tens. Two of his three wins in 2023 came in succession at Richmond and Michigan. Buescher continued his dream run in the Cup Series playoffs and eventually finished 7th in the final standings. The #17 Ford Mustang driver could not, however, secure a win in the Round of 8 and did not have enough points to make a case for the championship four race at Phoenix.

Overall, he has been one of the season’s standout performers and displayed incredible grit and consistency throughout the year. His performances in 2023 make a strong case for a place in the best 50 drivers of the year.

2. Denny Hamlin

Finding a fan of Denny Hamlin in the NASCAR fandom is a tough task. Continuously surrounded by controversy, Joe Gibbs Racing‘s #11 Toyota Camry driver has been subject to a lot of criticism. However, his ability as a race car driver has never been in doubt. As the season entered its decisive phase of the playoffs, it seemed like 2023 would be the year Hamlin’s championship drought finally ended.

The 43-year-old dominated the first round of the playoffs and was the driver to watch out for. He eventually won his first playoff race in Bristol and cruised to the next round. However, Hamlin revealed recently that a shoulder injury prevented him from being at the best of his abilities as the playoffs progressed. Having to depend much on his weaker arm, Hamlin stayed in contention for the championship four race until the final race in Martinsville.

He secured three wins, 14 top-fives, and 19 top-10 finishes in 2023. He also led a whopping 998 laps, which makes his omission from Autosport’s list seem unjustified. He finished 5th in the final standings and was one of the most consistent and best performers of the 2023 NASCAR season. From the looks of it, a championship trophy would have surely put him in the upper echelons of Autosport’s Top 50.

3. Christopher Bell

As unfortunate as Denny Hamlin was, his JGR teammate Christopher Bell must have felt hard done by after an impressive season. The #20 Toyota Camry driver progressed to the championship race for a second successive season. However, a cruel twist of fate waited for him in the season finale at Phoenix Raceway, as he was forced to retire early from the biggest race of his career with a broken brake rotor.

Bristol Bristol Motor Speedway Dirt Course Tennessee USA, EDITORIAL USE ONLY PUBLICATIONxINxGERxSUIxAUTxONLY Copyright: xRandyxSartinx 20230409_lbm_bs1_024

Bell’s 2023 season has gone under the radar. With an average starting position of 9.6, the 29-year-old was the sole driver to have an average starting position below 10. A win in the Round of 8 race at Homestead-Miami propelled him to a consecutive Championship 4 appearance. Christopher Bell also dominated the qualifying races throughout the season, especially in the playoffs. Bell recorded poles in the first three races of the playoffs to begin his playoff campaign on a superb note.

The Joe Gibbs Racing driver finished the season with two wins, 19 top-tens, and ten top-5s in 2023. He eventually finished fourth in the final NASCAR Cup Series standings and was another one of the prominent performers of the calendar year.

4. Tyler Reddick

2023 was a year of milestones for 23XI Racing. The team had two drivers in the Cup Series playoffs for the first time since its inception. One of the major reasons behind its success in 2023 is #45 Toyota Camry driver Tyler Reddick.

Alongside team owner Denny Hamlin, Tyler Reddick was the pick of the drivers in the first round of the NASCAR playoffs. The 27-year-old California native showcased his road course prowess with a win at COTA earlier this year. Carrying the momentum to the playoffs, Reddick won in Kansas in the Round of 16 to gain more traction for his championship push. He also had one of the best average starting positions among the drivers, with an average of 10.167, despite having only two poles to his name.

Tyler Reddick finished sixth in the final standings and ended the season with two wins, ten top-5s, and 16 top-10s. He also led 470 laps throughout the season and recorded his best-ever finish in the Cup Series. Reddick was among the dark horses for the 2023 NASCAR Cup Series title and certainly held the potential to win the competition.

5. Ross Chastain

Ross Chastain‘s performance in 2023 was one of the many positives for Trackhouse Racing this season. The 30-year-old Floridian created history in the season finale by becoming the first non-championship driver to win the Championship 4 race since the introduction of the new playoff system in 2014. Driving the #1 Chevrolet Camaro, the “Melon Man” equaled his career-best tally of two wins in a season after victories in Nashville and Phoenix.

While his on-track expertise was one of the notable points in 2023, his off-track antics didn’t go unnoticed either. Ross Chastain was clouded in controversy after a fistfight with Noah Gragson and on-track altercations with Denny Hamlin and Kyle Larson. While his cutthroat racing style appeased the fans, his driving skills didn’t waver either.

ADVERTISEMENT Article continues below this ad

Chastain scored two wins, ten 1op-5s, and 14 top-tens, while leading 640 laps in 2023. He also led the NASCAR Cup Series standings for seven weeks and had a career-best 28 lead lap finishes. Overall, Ross Chastain has been one of the most resilient NASCAR drivers of 2023 and deserves a mention among NASCAR’s very best.

Two more drivers to have featured in the 2023 NASCAR season and Autosport’s Top 50 Drivers are Supercars racers Shane van Gisbergen and Brodie Kostecki. While the pair battled for the championship in the Australian racing circuit, they also raced at the Indianapolis road course race earlier this season. SVG had earlier created history by winning in his NASCAR debut at the inaugural Chicago Street Race.

As the Premier League returns with a Saturday packed full of huge matches, talkSPORT gets the action started at Anfield.

But that's not all there is, with a Rugby World Cup semi-final, a London derby and a packed UFC card among the other offerings.

Here, talkSPORT runs through what is an epic day of sport.

Merseyside derby

Liverpool are sitting in a comfortable fourth place in the Premier League table having picked up five wins out of their opening eight games.

The bad news for Jurgen Klopp is that the Reds lost to Tottenham and only managed a draw with Brighton just before the international break.

And Klopp has a new worry: the Reds are without Andy Robertson after the left-back suffered a shoulder injury while on international duty with Scotland.

His absence could open up a gap in their defence for Everton to exploit.

The Toffees were winless in their first five games, but have since picked up two much-needed wins.

But Everton are up against the odds, having won just one out of the last 25 previous Merseyside derbies.

Crystal Palace look to end Newcastle's building momentum

The Magpies have been on an impressive run of form across all competitions, knocking last year's treble winners Manchester City out the Carabao Cup while defeating Paris Saint-Germain 4-1 in the Champions League.

But Crystal Palace proved to be an unbeatable obstacle for Newcastle last season.

They recorded a goalless draw against Palace in all three of their meetings last season in all competitions.

Newcastle are without Joe Willock and Harvey Barnes through injury - but Sandro Tonali is available, despite allegations of illegal betting which led to him being sent home from Italy's national team squad.

Meanwhile, Palace have been defensively impressive this term, keeping four clean sheets.

They sit ninth in the table, just one place behind Newcastle, and can vault the Magpies with a win.

Arsenal looking to remain 'Kings of London' away at Chelsea

Mikel Arteta's side go into the 5.30pm London derby clash full of confidence having beaten Manchester City in their last match.

And they boast a brilliant record against the Blues of late, winning six out of their last seven meetings.

They have triumphed in their last three trips to Stamford Bridge, and haven't lost in a London derby since May 2022.

As for Chelsea, they go into their match against the Gunners hopeful of a result having won their last three games in all competitions.

Both teams face injury doubts, with Arsenal to potentially be without Bukayo Saka and William Saliba, while it remains to be seen if Reece James and Armando Broja feature for the hosts.

Sheffield United desperate for points against lacklustre Manchester United

With just one point on the board, Sheffield United's season could not be going much worse given they are rock bottom.

With a fixture against Manchester United on the cards, though, they may feel their hopes could be looking up given Erik ten Hag's men disappointing season.

They sit tenth in the table having won four and lost as many from their opening eight games.

But their most recent Premier League victory over Brentford may give the Red Devils hope their season is on the up.

If you've had your football fix for the day, there's also a packed Saturday of rugby and cricket.

It's crunch time for England in the World Cups as they face South Africa in the semi-final of the Rugby World Cup and in the ODI Cricket World Cup.

After England secured victory over Fiji in the quarter-finals, they now look to overcome defending champions South Africa to advance into their second consecutive Rugby World Cup final.

Over in India, England's Cricket World Cup hopes hang by a thread after their latest shock defeat to Afghanistan.

They will be boosted by the news that Ben Stokes is fit for the match after he picked up a hip injury five days before the tournament.

But victory for England could scarcely be more crucial.

Having also lost to New Zealand in their opener, their chances of finishing in the top four and progressing to the semi-finals are looking dubious.

But South Africa, despite winning their first two games, suffered a shock defeat to the Netherlands in their most recent match - a sign for England that the Proteas can be beaten.

UFC 294 in Abu Dhabi

Islam Makhachev is hoping to to successfully defend his UFC lightweight belt against Alexander Volkanovski at UFC 294.

Makhachev retained his title in February this year as he defeated Volkanovski by a unanimous decision.

IPL 2024 Auction is over. And it’s a record breaking day in IPL history. For the first time ever, two players have breached the Rs 20 Cr mark with Mitchell Starc and Pat Cummins — two Australian pacers leading the money charts. Cummins went to Sunrisers Hyderabad for Rs 20.50 Cr but the record only lasted for 30 minutes as Kolkata Knight Riders broke the bank for Mitchell Starc, paying a whopping Rs 24.75 Cr. However, uncapped Indians such as Shubham Dubey and Sameer Rizvi too stole the show, bagging big contracts for their performances in regional T20 leagues.

A total of 72 players including 30 overseas players were sold for Rs 230.45 Cr combined.

sports,Nick Brinkerhoff,2023-09-28T21:41:00+00:00,"Travis Kelce has been catching a lot more than footballs lately, and fans everywhere have been swift to hop on the Taylor Swift bandwagon. The celebrity couple has been in the news for well over a week now, and despite the fatigue from many -- Chris 'Mad Dog' Russo's rant being among the most vocal -- companies like FanDuel just can't help but lean into a profitable storyline. Are they for real or is this ""Love Story"" just some extravagant publicity stunt?

Time will tell, but one thing's for certain when it comes to the media, social media, newspapers, football fans, Swifties, and just about everyone else within the 50 states and U.S. territories, including Puerto Rico and Guam: ""You need to calm down."" Regardless, Kelce and Swift take their tour on the road to Broadway, a place that puts on all the great shows. The traditional circus hasn't been in town for a few years now, but that's simply because the New York Jets exist and there was only room for one. It seems like ages since Aaron Rodgers marched out of the MetLife Stadium tunnel holding an American flag, but this is Zach Wilson's team now, whether you like it or not.

One of the most hyped ""Sunday Night Football"" games of the year was expected to feature Rodgers against Patrick Mahomes for the first time. Instead, we're more likely to be treated to non-stop split screens involving Swift and Rodgers, two people who won't be on the field. There will be some actual football, though, even if it is just a sideshow to the event everyone can't stop talking about. So, buckle up and enjoy whatever this is, and for all the fans paying ridiculous prices for a glimpse of Ms. Swift — make sure your phone is charged.

To Travis and Taylor, ""Welcome to New York."" It's been waiting for you. Well, actually, the swamps of northern New Jersey have. Enjoy the traffic and a look at the famous skyline.

For bettors, where there is hype, there's also an opportunity to make some money. FanDuel has released a special prop bets menu, cleverly called ""Prop Stars"" for the Swift-inspired wagers. Here's a look at how you can catch some cash in prime time.

MORE: Jets vs. Chiefs betting preview

FanDuel 'Prop Stars' Picks: Best bets for Travis Kelce & Taylor Swift-inspired props for Chiefs-Jets Week 4

Top of the Charts: Travis Kelce to have the Most Receiving Yards in the Game (+140)

The Jets know that Kelce is trouble long before he even walks in. If they want any chance in this game, they'll have to slow down No. 87. This is a New York defense that's been very good, although not quite great, over the last year and continues to improve. Robert Saleh's troops have held opponents in check, giving their anemic offense a fighting chance most weeks, but if there's one thing that Gang Green struggles to defend against, it's the tight end. They're giving up the fifth-most receiving yards to the position this season (56.3) and just allowed Pharoah Brown to beat them for a long 58-yard touchdown last Sunday. Getting +140 is a nice price for the best pass-catcher in this game, but there's too much blowout potential to warrant taking a flier here.

Our pick: Pass

Seeing Red: Chiefs to Win by 22+ (+380)

If this bet ends up cashing, the ""Seeing Red"" tagline would apply to a lot more than just Chiefs fans. Bettors would be in the green, and those wearing green would be the ones with red-ish, cartoon-like faces. Odds are, Wilson would have to be atrocious again considering New York's defense isn't a pushover. The Jets often like to make games close, even when they seemingly have no business in doing so. Even if they are steamrolled, a garbage time score is more than enough to ruin this wager.

Our pick: Pass

Opening Act: Travis Kelce First TD Scorer (+400)

Out of all the specials, this one is our favorite. The Chiefs will likely score first whether they get the opening kickoff or not. When we look at the Jets, we see an offensive coordinator that somehow underrated Micah Parsons and a team that refuses to take the training wheels off their former gunslinging quarterback. Wilson has turned into ""Checkdown Charlie"" as a result of conservative coaching, and we don't expect that to change in the early going. Lean into the narrative and sprinkle a little cash on Kelce to break the plane first.

Our pick: Bet on it

FriENDZONE: Travis Kelce to NOT score a TD (+120)

Obviously, based on our last recommendation, we're friendzoning this bet and not laying down any action on it.

Our pick: Pass

Running Away Together: Chiefs to have 150+ Total Rushing Yards (+420)

The strength of the Jets roster is along the defensive line, and the Chiefs are a pass-first team that loves to light it up through the air. This is the first time that Patrick Mahomes is playing in the New York area. He'll want to put on a show, and Andy Reid certainly isn't going to hold him back. Don't expect the Chiefs to start running until it's time to chew the clock.

Our pick: Pass

Seemingly Ranch: Travis Kelce Last TD Scorer (+550)

Ranch is a fine condiment and beloved by many, which makes this wager something that should be seen as an insult to ranch fans everywhere. Unless the Jets make this a close game or send it to overtime, we have a hard time believing that Kelce will even be on the field to score the last touchdown. Avoid this one like people with taste buds avoid bleu cheese and treat your nuggets with respect.

Our pick: Pass

Plot Twist: Zach Wilson to have 300+ Passing Yards (+1800)

If you asked the average Jets' fan what is holding this roster back, the overwhelming results would be Wilson. ""I'm the problem, it's me,"" would probably qualify as the lyrics played in his walk-up song if fans had anything to say about it. But Wilson doesn't have time to be the anti-hero, or villain, as traditionalists would say. He needs to flip the script and shake it off. The Jets need to let him sling the ball around the field instead of worrying about the bad turnovers. They aren't winning this game 14-10, and they aren't winning anything if they can't let their quarterback be who he is. Are we betting this? Absolutely not, but that would be one heck of a plot twist, right? Perhaps the script writers are working overtime.

Our pick: Pass

Platinum Performance: Travis Kelce to Score 3+ TDs (+2500)

When it comes to Kelce's greatest hits, he prefers to save them for division rivals like the Raiders and Chargers. In your wildest dreams this bet might hit, and it might happen in reality too. Kelce could be schmoozing in the suite when the second half begins rather than throwing blocks and catching footballs on the field. But if the Jets keep it close, they are prone to being exploited by players like Kelce. With receivers lacking on the Chiefs sideline, the tight end might put on a show that is typically only found in show business. Considering he hosted “Saturday Night Live” back in March, Kelce is familiar with how to tell a story. We have him scoring once, so what’s another two times to cash a monster long shot? Don't count on it, but don't rule it out either. And please, have fun and bet responsibly.

Our pick: Bet on it (with a small wager)

Exes & 0s: NY Jets to Score 0 Total Points (+3400)

The Jets are currently back in a familiar place as the laughingstock of the NFL. Swift, like many celebrities, has plenty of exes, but she always scores again. Maybe the haters are right. Maybe Kelce will be the subject of the next big hit. Maybe the publicists are cashing checks with this brilliant idea. Maybe it's real. Time will tell, but when the relationship inevitably falls apart like most dream celebrity couples do, there is always another someone. Point is, the Jets are without the quarterback they married, and now they're back together with Wilson. It's not glamorous, but they'll score again. Shutting out NFL teams is no easy task, but the Chiefs defense is much improved and the Jets look like a team that doesn’t have a quarterback. Don’t consider it likely to hit, but +3400 wagers hardly ever are. Consider this a fun bet, unless you’re a Jets fan, and see how long K.C. can keep NYC off the scoreboard. They might just do it for the entire game.

NFL Best Bets Week 9: Against the spread

All odds courtesy of Caesars Sportsbook

Colts (-2.5) at Panthers

Bryce Young has looked much better now that he has settled into his rookie season with the Panthers, but Carolina still seems like a work in progress. The Colts, meanwhile, have quietly been operating a pretty decent offense — much better than their three-game losing streak might suggest. Indy has scored 65 points between Week 7 and 8, 29 more points than Panthers have scored in that span.

In a Gardner Minshew-Bryce Young battle, we'll take the 'Shew — and the backfield committee of Jonathan Taylor and Zack Moss against Carolina's abysmal run defense just serves as icing on the proverbial cake. The Panthers have allowed the most rushing TDs (14), the third-most points per game (28.4), and the fourth-most rushing yards per game (139.4) during their 1-7 start. The Colts will cruise in this one.

FINAL SCORE PREDICTION: Colts 27, Panthers 17

Seahawks (+6) at Ravens

Baltimore's defense has been incredible of late, and the Ravens seem to be flying under the radar (so to speak) at 6-2. However, the sportsbooks have clearly taken note of their awesome run, giving the NFC West-leading Seahawks a full touchdown on the road. This seems like a great opportunity for us to rock with the 'dog, considering Seattle has won two straight contests and gone 2-1 on the road (including a big win over the high-flying Lions in Detroit).

Geno Smith hasn't been the same Pro Bowl QB as he was in 2022, but he has still demonstrated moments of brilliance for Pete Carroll's squad. And with DK Metcalf and Kenneth Walker III a week closer to full health — and backup RB Zack Charbonnet looking like he's on the verge of a breakout — we like Seattle to at least make this a game in Baltimore. The 'Hawks defense has quietly been pretty good, and we know what kind of fireworks this offense is capable of when everything's clicking. Take an extra 1.5 points as insurance if you want, but we're taking the Seahawks to cover the +6.

FINAL SCORE PREDICTION: Ravens 26, Seahawks 23

Other Week 9 spreads we like: Patriots (-3) vs. Commanders; Raiders -1.5 vs. Giants

Best NFL moneyline bets Week 9

Dolphins (+110) vs. Chiefs (Germany game)

We get it — the Dolphins have yet to defeat a true contender this season and the Chiefs are the reigning champions of the NFL. However, Kansas City just got its doors blown off by Russell Wilson and the lowly Broncos, a game in which Patrick Mahomes and company suffered five turnovers and three sacks.

We expect a statement win from Mike McDaniel and the Dolphins on neutral ground. The Dolphins have been in Frankfurt since early this week, having flown overnight on Monday to give them multiple days to acclimate to the time difference and their surroundings. The Chiefs, meanwhile, waited until after practice on Thursday to take the 11-hour voyage.

This also happens to be a revenge game for former Chiefs receiver Tyreek Hill, who's on pace for multiple single-season receiving records and poised for his first Offensive Player of the Year award. Oh, and Raheem Mostert, who leads the NFL with 10 TDs and ranks second behind only Breece Hall in yards per carry (5.4), should be licking his chops against a Kansas City D that has surrendered 135.6 rushing yards per game over the past three weeks. Fins up in Frankfurt!

FINAL SCORE PREDICTION: Dolphins 26, Chiefs 24

Other Week 9 moneylines we like: Vikings (+170) at Falcons; Bengals (-130) vs. Bills; Cowboys (+140) at Eagles

Best NFL over/under bets Week 9

Raiders vs. Giants: UNDER 37.5

It sounds ludicrous to offer an UNDER of 37.5 as a best bet, but this game takes the cake in a Week 9 schedule loaded with underwhelming matchups. The Raiders just fired their head coach and GM and demoted starting QB Jimmy Garoppolo after appearing lost on Monday night, while the Giants just got Daniel Jones back after scoring a combined 33 points across three miserable performances in a row. Oh, and Darren Waller, the G-men's best pass-catcher, is hurt.

On top of all that, the Giants and Raiders have both been pretty good on the defensive side of the football as of late, so expect Danny Dimes and Aidan O'Connell to have a tough time finding any kind of rhythm in the passing game. This won't be a fun one to watch, but it should be a fun result for UNDER bettors.

FINAL SCORE PREDICTION: Raiders 17, Giants 13

Other Week 9 over/unders we like: Colts at Panthers: OVER 44; Commanders at Patriots: OVER 41; Saints OVER 25.5 vs. Bears

Rashee Rice, Chiefs vs. Dolphins in Germany — OVER 45.5 receiving yards

As soon as I opened up my SuperDraft app, Rashee Rice popped out as the first prop of the first game on Sunday morning (9:30 a.m. in Frankfurt). We love this rookie receiver and the big play ability he has consistently flashed over the past month. During that span, he has averaged over 55 receiving yards per game despite the Chiefs' games being decided by an average of 11.8 points per game.

MORE SUPERDRAFT DFS & FANTASY PROPS: How to play SuperDraft

This one should be a tightly-contested, high-scoring game — with heavy playoff implications, because we all know this could be an AFC Championship preview — so expect Rice to be very busy through all four frames in Frankfurt. The Dolphins have allowed the fifth-most receptions and the 12th-most yards to wideouts this season. If a bounce-back week is meant to be, Sir Rashee is our destiny.

Austin Ekeler, RB, Chargers @ Jets — OVER 29.5 receiving yards

Guess who's back? Back again...Ek is back....tell a friend. The Chargers finally got their best player back to full health, with Ekeler exploding for 123 yards and a TD against the Bears last weekend. A whopping 94 of those 123 yards came through the air, as the PPR god gashed Chicago for chunk yardage a handful of times.

Expect more of the same from QB Justin Herbert and his stud back against the Jets, who have allowed 46 receiving yards per game to RBs (sixth-most in the NFL). They'll try to shut him down this Sunday, but it would feel so empty without AE!

Jahan Dotson, WR, Commanders @ Patriots — OVER 45.5 receiving yards

We've come full circle with Dotson, who made our preseason sleepers column then faded into early-season obscurity only to emerge again over the past two weeks. Curtis Samuel was clearly not right last week, and the second-year wideout more than made up for it. Dotson caught 8-of-10 targets for 108 yards and a TD, a stellar encore to his Week 7 line of five catches for 43 yards. The banged-up Patriots defense will be primarily focused on stopping stud Commanders receiver Terry McLaurin, which should open up plenty of opportunities for Dotson.","NFL Best Bets Week 9: Colts clobber Panthers, Dolphins drop Chiefs in Germany",https://www.sportingnews.com/us/nfl/news/nfl-best-bets-week-9-spread-moneyline-over-under-props/a1ec41161f82a56561cdac97,Sporting News
sports,Kyle Bonn,2023-12-13T20:52:15+00:00,"As Manchester United's season continues to slip away, the pressure around Dutch boss Erik ten Hag continues to get more palpable.

The latest slip saw the Red Devils crash out of Europe as they fell 1-0 to Bayern Munich on the final day of Champions League group-stage play, finishing bottom of their four-team group to leave them eliminated from Europe in their worst performance in the competition since 2005.

On top of that, they set the record for most goals against in a Champions League group stage by an English club, with 15 conceded in their six games. Their defensive record has collapsed as the season goes on: from a Premier League standpoint, they sit eighth in the English top flight, but their -5 goal differential is the worst of any club in the top 10.

With Jim Ratcliffe having now completed the formalities around his investment into the club, taking control of 25% of his boyhood club after a year of negotiations, the pressure will be piled on even more. Indeed, Ratcliffe wants United back at ""the very top of world football"".

The Sporting News has laid out all the options should Man United move on from Ten Hag and look for a new beginning, in the hopes of salvaging the 2023/24 season.

Man United next manager: Assessing candidates to replace Erik ten Hag

If Manchester United decide to pull the plug on Erik ten Hag's managerial tenure at Old Trafford, there aren't any perfect options for his replacement.

That allows us to speculate some as to who could slot in as the next man hoping to take United back to former glories, which still evade the club since the departure of Sir Alex Ferguson over a decade ago.

Zinedine Zidane

The former Real Madrid manager has been out of work since departing the Spanish club in 2021, clearly waiting for the right position to open up. He was heavily rumoured to be in line for the France position once the 2022 World Cup finished, but Didier Deschamps surprised many by signing a new contract.

Zidane would be a top choice for United, as he would be for many top clubs with a managerial vacancy, but there's questions around whether he would be open to signing on. The 51-year-old told Marca back in June of 2022 that he isn't exactly thrilled about a Premier League job due to the language barrier.

When asked specifically about a possible job opening in Manchester, Zidane said: ""I understand English, but I don't master it completely. I know that there are coaches who go to clubs without speaking the language, but I work in a different way. Many elements come into play to win. It is a global context."" Does he still feel the same way?

Graham Potter

While Potter's time at Chelsea crashed and burned, many still rate the former Brighton & Hove Albion boss highly and he could be in line for a project job such as this. Indeed, there have previously been rumours that Sir Jim Ratcliffe, the INEOS founder on the brink of purchasing a 25 per cent stake in United, would like Potter at the club. He has been out of work since his Blues tenure came to a close back in April, but it would be a hard sell to fans after his time with the London club went so poorly.

Roberto De Zerbi

One of the fastest rising managers in the game, Brighton manager Roberto De Zerbi is known for his tactical innovation in transitional play, and his name has cropped up a number of times when big clubs have an opening.

The 44-year-old Italian has led the tiny club to new heights, qualifying for the Europa League for the first time in club history and establishing themselves as top-four contenders, building upon the success under Graham Potter. Yet could Potter's failure at Chelsea cause some trepidation around another Brighton success story moving on up?

Michael Carrick

This list wouldn't be complete without mention of the likeliest of those with direct Manchester United links. Former United midfielder Michael Carrick, who made 316 appearances for the club over a 12-year Old Trafford tenure, is at Championship club Middlesbrough, his first permanent managerial appointment. They sit 11th in the second tier as of mid-December, just three points back of the playoff spots in a crowded top half.

Carrick's lack of experience is glaring, but hiring someone with deep knowledge of the club could be very enticing, and the fact he hasn't bombed in his first job is notable. The 42-year-old has also led the Red Devils before on a caretaker basis, installed back in 2021 after Ole Gunnar Solskjaer's dismissal and leading the club to some big wins over Arsenal in league play and Villarreal in the Champions League before Ralf Rangnick took over.

Hansi Flick

The former German national-team manager only lasted two years on the job with Die Mannschaft, before their failures at the 2022 World Cup caught up with him. Yet Flick has big club experience, having led Bayern Munich first as an assistant under Niko Kovac and then for two years as manager, winning the treble in 2019/20 en route to being named UEFA Coach of the Year.

Yet Flick's lack of experience of any kind outside Germany — he has just one year abroad, as an assistant at Red Bull Salzburg — coupled with his struggles at the national-team level could give some pause at bringing him to England for such a project position.

Antonio Conte

Former Chelsea and Tottenham boss Conte hasn't cropped up near the top of any betting lists, but there could be some sense in hiring the Italian to take over at Old Trafford. Conte has been out of work since his acrimonious departure from Tottenham this past summer, after he seemingly shoved his way out of the club amidst reports he was utterly miserable in London.

While the idea of a control freak such as Conte taking over the Manchester United mess could easily be a recipe for disaster, the club could also seek out a fixer of his nature, hoping for an immediate boost they can build on once things crumble under the Italian, as they often do. Still, the Red Devils would likely have competition as he seems to prefer working in his home country.

Julen Lopetegui

Fifty-seven-year-old Spanish boss Lopetegui represents maybe the perfect mix of experience, availability, and interest as Manchester United seek out possible new managers. Lopetegui is most known for his time in charge of the Spanish national team, where he succeeded Vincente del Bosque, but he also has big club experience at Real Madrid.

Lopetegui has also managed in the Premier League, seemingly on an upward trajectory at Wolves before abruptly leaving just days before the current season amidst tension with the board. And therein lies the issue around Lopetegui: he has left multiple positions in mysterious and awkward circumstances, with his Wolves exit reminiscent of his departure from the Spanish national team, where he suddenly departed just days before the start of the 2018 World Cup as news of his discussions with Real Madrid came to light. Between those two incidents, and his failed tenures at Madrid and Sevilla, would he be worth the risk at Old Trafford?

Names that don't make sense as next Man United manager

Julian Nagelsmann

While the German's name has come up in betting circles as a possibility for the next Manchester United manager, there's no sense to this actually taking place. Nagelsmann was only recently hired as the head coach of the German national team, meaning there's no chance he is available until after Euro 2024 at the earliest, and in that case, it's likely that Germany flopped at their own tournament, meaning his hire would probably be quite sour. This one just doesn't add up.

Lionel Scaloni

While it's conceivable that the Argentine could become available at a moment's notice amid speculation of his potential exit with the defending World Cup champions, this feels an unlikely pairing. Should he indeed leave Argentina, Scaloni has been open about his mental fatigue and is likely to take some time off from management. In the event he does return quickly, he's been heavily linked to Real Madrid as a possible replacement for the Carlo Ancelotti, who is expected to become the next permanent Brazil head coach.

It's hard to imagine that Scaloni, who seemingly craves stability and routine, has no experience at club level, and lacks ties to the Premier League or Old Trafford (beyond a brief loan spell with West Ham as a player in 2006) would be a match for Manchester United in any capacity.

Gareth Southgate

You can sense a trend here as another currently employed national-team manager is mentioned in England boss Southgate. While he's been linked to the United job before, it would take a perfect storm for him to be installed, whether on a permanent basis or as an interim stopgap option.

Some believe he could be considered next summer once the Euros are over: it has been speculated that Southgate could leave his England post following next summer's tournament, with his contract expiring in December next year. However, it's also possible he decides to stay on for the 2026 World Cup cycle, particularly if England have a good tournament in Germany. In that instance, he would only be available for double duty on a temporary basis, and that would simply be too messy to outweigh the benefits. Brazil are currently in that boat, and it's all gone wrong for Fernando Diniz despite his Copa Libertadores victory with Fluminense.

Mauricio Pochettino

In the event Todd Boehly proves to sport just as itchy a trigger finger as his successor Roman Abramovich at Chelsea, it's possible that Mauricio Pochettino becomes available should Manchester United look to move on from Erik ten Hag. But would he really be a sellable hire, having just failed in London after bombing at PSG and departing Tottenham in acrimonious manner? It seems unlikely that United would be interested in someone who demands significant club control and will have just been fired from a struggling league rival.

Manchester United managers since Sir Alex Ferguson

If Manchester United were to appoint a new manager, that person would be the ninth coach to take charge of a United team following Sir Alex Ferguson's retirement in May 2013, including caretaker/interim managers Ryan Giggs, Ralf Rangnick and Carrick.

With the previously unbeaten Philadelphia Eagles also losing ugly Sunday, this edition of the Pick Six column addresses key questions facing Super Bowl favorites with one-third of the 18-week regular season nearly complete.

So far this season, we’ve seen the Miami Dolphins set NFL records for offense, only to lose by four touchdowns in their lone game against a true contender. We’ve seen the Kansas City Chiefs win with defense, sometimes in spite of their offense. We’ve seen the Buffalo Bills incur devastating injuries. Here we’ll address 10 teams with the shortest Super Bowl odds, running through what I think and what NFL insiders have to say.

The full Pick Six menu this week:

• Unanswered questions for contenders

• When “playing to win” goes too far

• Championship roster, rookie kicker

• Do they make wristbands for coaches?

• Giants, Vikings and winning too soon

• Two-minute drill: Wackiest win in a while

GO DEEPER The Eagles' 'tush push' play is taking over the NFL. But is it working?

1. Where do the top 10 current Super Bowl contenders stand one-third of the way through the season? Let’s hit key questions facing the Chiefs, Eagles, 49ers, Bills, Bengals, Cowboys, Ravens, Lions, Dolphins and Jaguars.

You can scroll through the latest Super Bowl future odds from BetMGM below.

• San Francisco 49ers: What do they have in Purdy?

What I think: Let’s start with what the 49ers do not have in Purdy. They do not have an AFC North-certified, weatherproof Ben Roethlisberger clone able to overpower the elements, break away from defensive linemen and thrive in the conditions Purdy faced against Cleveland. What they do have is a good, young quarterback well-suited to run Kyle Shanahan’s offense at a high level by making quick decisions when given time to find open receivers.

Exec comment: “The 49ers knew they needed a good quarterback to win the Super Bowl, and they knew they could help Purdy be that. Give him a great receiving tight end, two good receivers and a great halfback who fits the system, and they’ll get someone open on every pass play. But then Deebo Samuel gets hurt, Christian McCaffrey gets hurt, and now we don’t have as many guys open. Especially when you face a defensive coordinator who says, ‘You show me you can beat me throwing the ball outside the numbers — best of luck, and to do that, you are going to have to take a five-step drop and I’m going to have Myles Garrett chasing you every play.'”

• Kansas City Chiefs: Is the explosive passing game gone for good?

What I think: The Chiefs have never scored less per game on offense through six games or a full season since Patrick Mahomes became their quarterback. They have also never enjoyed larger average point differentials (9.8 per game), because their defense is so much better. I think the pass offense will become slightly more explosive as Mahomes gets reps with his receivers, but I’m not expecting a huge shift.

The Chiefs are averaging 9.5 plays per touchdown drive when starting at least 70 yards from the opponent’s goal line, per TruMedia. That figure was 7.8 in Mahomes’ first year as the starter and has climbed every season since. It’s a testament to the Chiefs’ adaptability, but also a reflection of plummeting explosive play rates.

Exec comment: “Yeah, it looks harder for them on offense until Mahomes finds (Travis) Kelce on every major third down, every major two-minute play, every major touchdown. Kansas City has the luxury of their best players being their toughest players. Chris Jones is a very tough player. Kelce is a very tough player. Mahomes is a very tough player. You wonder why they win the games? Because the games are won by the toughest teams most of the time.”

• Philadelphia Eagles: Has Jalen Hurts regressed? Where are the explosive pass plays?

What I think: Explosive passing is down through most of the league, including for the Eagles. They are gaining more than 15 yards on just 11 percent of pass plays, down from 21 percent through six games last season and 19 percent for 2022 overall. Jalen Hurts, A.J. Brown, DeVonta Smith and Dallas Goedert are still on the team, so I’m inclined to trust the production will return. But there’s also a lingering fear defenses have caught up to aspects of the Eagles’ scheme. Does Philly have a counterpunch?

Exec comment: “People are going to crush Hurts and the offense. They are just churning the clock so much. It just feels like they are imposing their will on teams through the run game and through their short passing and it just hasn’t taken off from an explosive passing standpoint, so when they play a team that can move the ball on them through the air, it presents some challenges.”

GO DEEPER Behind the AI magic that lets Amazon's Prime Vision show the NFL like never before

• Buffalo Bills: Are the defensive injuries too much to overcome?

What I think: The rest of the conference is the key variable. The Bills are diminished. They have imperfections. But Buffalo already defeated the Dolphins. The other AFC teams aren’t exactly peaking. Kansas City and Cincinnati appear easier to defend this season than in the recent past. We’ll see how well the Dolphins hold up. This can still be Buffalo’s season.

Exec comment: “Matt Milano and Tre’Davious White, those are huge injuries for that football team. The Bills are not as dominant as they felt going into it with so many injuries on defense. But the division they are in, they will still be able to slug it out and get to where they need to go. Nobody has really emerged in the AFC to unseat these teams at the top.”

• Miami Dolphins: Has Tua Tagovailoa proven he’s built to last?

What I think: It was tough watching Tagovailoa last season without worrying for his physical well-being. I’ve never felt that way watching him so far this season, and will feel even better if he plays a full game against Philadelphia in Week 7. New England, Kansas City, the Jets (twice), Washington, Tennessee, Dallas, Baltimore and Buffalo will all get their shots at Tagovailoa. I’m cautiously optimistic, but think there will be games when defense muddy the picture sufficiently to create turnovers.

Exec comment: “Interesting team. They put up 70 on Denver and should have put up 70 on the Giants. No one can keep up with that kind of firepower. But they also haven’t really beaten anyone. They were down 14 points to Carolina. Do you think they are coming back from 13 down against Philly? In my opinion, no.”

• Dallas Cowboys: Is this team any better than previous Dallas teams that fell short?

What I think: It’s a tough time to evaluate the Cowboys fairly because they were so bad against San Francisco on a big stage in their most recent game. I just don’t see where Dallas is better or going to get considerably better, especially on offense. And every time they enjoy success, they seem to enjoy it a little too much. That is a reflection of their owner.

Exec comment: “Run defense and consistency on defense, and then offensively, what is their identity? They just are not very good. Their best games are when they play great defense and get turnovers, but that is not going to happen enough, especially against the good teams.”

• Detroit Lions: Have they fixed their defense?

What I think: The Lions are 11.3 EPA per game better on defense from last season to this season, the second-largest gain for any team since last season. The schedule has something to do with that, but the 2022 defense was so bad, it couldn’t stop Carolina. Detroit will win the NFC North and return to the playoffs, which will make this season successful no matter what happens from there. But we won’t find out until the postseason just how much better the defense might be, because the remaining schedule features so many weak offenses. That includes Chicago twice, Green Bay, Denver and Las Vegas.

Exec comment: “Yes, I do buy them. This is a league full of teams who do not really know who they are week to week. Detroit knows who they are, and they play to their identity. Anytime you know who you are and play to that style, you have a chance to be dangerous.”

• Baltimore Ravens: Are the Ravens better off shifting to more of a pass-oriented offense?

What I think: Baltimore has never scored fewer points or amassed less offensive EPA through the first six games of a season with Lamar Jackson in the lineup. The schedule and injuries have played roles, but with the Ravens shifting toward a more conventional pass offense, are the explosive quarterback runs mostly in the past? Jackson has one rush longer than 20 yards (he’s had four or five by now previously). He’s gaining at least eight yards on 15 percent of carries, half his previous rate. I’m not expecting a consistent precision passing game to suddenly materialize. Will this new offense be tougher to defend?

Exec comment: “The defense keeps them in it, but I don’t necessarily think this offensive change is going to make them any better when it counts. Lamar Jackson does not appear as dynamic as a runner, but in this offense, he does not need to be. He is regulated to pass from the pocket, but you are taking away the biggest weapon the offense had when you do that. Odell (Beckham) is not that guy anymore. Who are you truly afraid of on that offense? Nobody but Lamar, and if you are not using Lamar in a certain capacity, he becomes just like the rest of these quarterbacks around the league — hit or miss.”

• Jacksonville Jaguars: Are they ready for prime time?

What I think: Trevor Lawrence’s knee injury was the big concern coming out of Sunday. If he’s out, expectations shift dramatically. More than the other AFC contenders, the Jaguars seem early in their life cycle, still finding their way. That makes them a little harder to trust in big spots but also leaves greater space for growth. Let’s hope those test results on Lawrence’s knee come back clear.

Exec comment: “I like Jacksonville. Doug (Pederson) has a championship pedigree. This team is relatively young. They are scrappy. The fact that they have been there before gives them a chance. I think the quarterback is growing.”

• Cincinnati Bengals: Can Joe Burrow hold up for a full season?

What I think: Burrow is looking healthier over the past two weeks. The bye week comes at a great time for Burrow to get even healthier, but check out the schedule on the other side: San Francisco, Buffalo, Houston, Baltimore, Pittsburgh and Jacksonville. Cincy still has a second game with the Steelers, plus games against Kansas City and Cleveland. I’m worried Burrow will wear down against these defenses.

Exec comment: “You cannot always expect Joe Burrow to create magic with a bottom-half offensive line. The line is my concern all the way.”

2. Are teams sometimes going too far playing to win? The Eagles come to mind after falling 20-14 to the Jets.

Most would agree teams have gotten smarter in their handling of fourth-down situations, going for it when it makes sense, instead of punting almost out of habit. Making the aggressive play to win can absolutely be the smart play, regardless of results. It’s progress when teams seriously wrestle with these questions, not just on fourth down, but in all aspects of their strategy.

But when the Eagles tossed a killer interception on third-and-9 from their own 46-yard line while protecting a 14-12 lead against the Jets with two minutes left in the fourth quarter, a longtime NFL exec reached out with a question: “Have we come too far with coaches wanting to ‘win’ the game instead of sometimes being more traditional?”

His point: Philadelphia could have run the ball on third-and-9, then punted from around midfield. The Jets would have taken possession with barely more than a minute remaining, no timeouts and Zach Wilson behind center facing a ferocious Eagles pass rush. Was having Hurts pass in a situation when gaining a first down is unlikely the smart play under the circumstances?

“Are coaches not willing to go against the slight statistical benefit that WPA (win probability added) provides?” the exec asked. “Is it no longer OK to let your defense win the game when it clearly has a huge talent/performance advantage? This Eagles game was 14-12, not 37-35.”

Critics attuned to the trend toward aggressiveness pounce when teams pass up chances to go for the kill. Coaches know team owners tend to be fans, not football strategists. They know owners listen to these criticisms. That can provide an incentive to make the aggressive play, to go down swinging.

“Everybody thinks they are playing Brady, Manning or Rodgers in two-minute,” a veteran coach said. “If before the game someone offered Philly to put its defense against Zach Wilson on a need-field-goal drive starting inside his own 15 with no timeouts and a minute left, you think they would have taken it?”

In the situation Sunday, the Jets’ offense had netted 19 yards on its previous three possessions, producing one field goal on a drive that gained 16 of those yards. The Eagles had already suffered three turnovers. They knew Wilson would be taking over deep in his territory with very little time remaining.

“To me, these are exactly the type of factors that a coach needs to consider when deciding,” the exec said. “I think they were ignored here.”

The situation Philly faced against the Jets was the seventh time since 2000 that a team leading by 1-2 points in the final two minutes faced third down with 7-10 yards to go from the minus-40 yard line to midfield, with the opponent holding no timeouts.

Three of the seven teams passed, resulting in one first down, one sack and Hurts’ interception. Of these three teams, only the Eagles lost the game.

3. The 49ers lost Sunday when their rookie kicker missed from 41 yards. Is San Francisco wise trusting a championship roster to a rookie’s foot come playoff time?

The 49ers raised eyebrows among some when they used their second-highest pick in the 2023 draft — a third-round choice, 99th overall — for a kicker. The selection of Michigan’s Jake Moody gave the 49ers a cost-effective successor to veteran Robbie Gould. General manager John Lynch called Moody a potentially “foundational” player whose stock in the draft was so high, other teams were trying to trade ahead of San Francisco for a shot at him.

Who do you want lining up the potential winning kick in a Super Bowl? It’s an interesting question in a season that has seen Moody and Saints rookie Blake Grupe miss game-winning tries, but the data could be on the 49ers’ side.

FGA Dist Rookies Veterans <33 Yds 97% [31-32] 94% [330-351] 34-44 Yds 75% [21-28] 82% [230-279] 45-50 Yds 78% [7-9] 73% [121-165] 51-55 Yds 100% [8-8] 59% [33-56] 56+ Yds 0% [0-1] 55% [6-11] Totals 86% [67-78] 84% [720-862]

The table above shows field-goal make rates in the postseason since 2000 for rookie kickers vs. veterans. The numbers stack up pretty evenly across various distance cutoffs. Based on these numbers, there’s no statistical indication rookies are less effective in the postseason.

“Playoff teams have a different aura, different feel in the locker room,” a veteran evaluator said. “Percentages are one thing, but who is the guy who trots out there to try the game-winner? It’s a different pressure shooting free throws up by 20, down by 20, than in that type of situation.”

Fans might recall rookie kickers missing playoff kicks: Rodrigo Blankenship with the Colts in 2020, Harrison Butker with the Chiefs in 2017, Nate Kaeding with the Chargers in 2005. But the NFL has seen plenty of rookies kick effectively in the postseason as well. Evan McPherson made all 14 postseason tries with the 2021 Super Bowl Bengals. The 2017 Eagles won a Super Bowl with rookie Jake Elliott performing well. The 2012 Super Bowl champion Ravens had rookie Justin Tucker, while the 2006 Patriots trusted rookie Stephen Gostkowski.

4. Do they make wristbands for head coaches? That is not the only question facing the Broncos.

Denver Broncos coach Sean Payton has made clear his frustration with quarterback Russell Wilson in myriad ways, including when he suggested Wilson could at some point wear a wristband if it would help speed up communication in the huddle.

We joked on the Football GM Podcast that the head coach himself could have used a wristband to assist with game management after the Broncos called timeout before punting with 22 seconds left in the first half of a 19-8 defeat at Kansas City in Week 6. Payton said he thought Denver was heading into third down, not fourth, when he called timeout, helping the Chiefs’ drive to a field goal.

It wasn’t an isolated miscue. Denver has twice this season used all three timeouts with at least four minutes remaining before halftime. Payton suffered that fate only four times in 258 total games coaching the Saints, when his association with Drew Brees was one of the most successful partnerships in recent NFL history. Payton has had it happen twice in six games with Wilson as his quarterback.

Across the league, teams have used all their first-half timeouts above four minutes just 14 times since 2020. That includes six times by Carolina when Matt Rhule coached the Panthers. Payton is the only other coach with more than one such game over the past three-plus seasons.

The irony is rich in Denver, where Payton’s predecessor, Nathaniel Hackett, was mocked for his game management so thoroughly, the team made him hire veteran assistant Jerry Rosburg to help him after only three games (Denver was 2-1 at that point). The Broncos under Hackett had trouble getting out of the huddle on time.

Hackett took the hit for those issues, but when the problem recurred under Payton, the blame shifted to Wilson, the common denominator.

All of this is pointing toward a future in Denver that includes Payton but not Wilson. Payton’s game plans over the past two weeks were conservative enough to suggest the coach was publicly demonstrating he does not think he can run his offense as currently configured, despite some success on the ground. These game plans were conservative enough to signal a potential in-season quarterback change. Denver faces Green Bay and Kansas City over the next two weeks before heading into its Week 9 bye.

5. You play to win the game, but can you win too quickly? The Giants and Vikings are test cases.

The New York Giants and Minnesota Vikings exceeded expectations under first-year head coaches in 2022. Both reached the playoffs. Both are struggling in their second seasons, facing difficult questions about the future. Would they have been better off enjoying only moderate success early? That could depend on how well the football leadership has communicated with ownership.

Every head coach and general manager wants to win as much as possible, but the goal is to build for the long term, which can require time to do things with sustainability in mind. Bad teams that win right away can reset expectations for fans and ownership, making it less practical to take one step backward in the short term for a better shot at taking two steps forward down the line.

What do the Giants’ and Vikings’ ownerships think?

“The best first year can be that 7-10 season where you show some promise,” a veteran coach with experience on a half-dozen teams said. “The Giants won a bunch of games early, people were heaping praise on the head coach, people get the expectation of what the quarterback can be. But oftentimes, you know different internally because you know the house you are living in. You are inside the walls every single day and you know where the roof leaks, where the foundation is cracked.”

Buffalo managed such a situation well. The Bills surprisingly reached the playoffs in their first season under Sean McDermott, a euphoric moment after a 17-year playoff drought. They went 6-10 the next year, then began a steady rise behind Josh Allen and a top defense. There isn’t a Josh Allen on the Giants or Vikings.

Minnesota in particular finds itself in an interesting spot, with Kirk Cousins approaching free agency and playing well enough, most likely, to keep the Vikings from climbing too high in the draft order.

“They already gave a contract to (tight end) T.J. Hockenson, and they are going to give one to (receiver) Justin Jefferson,” an exec said. “Now, what? Are you going into the rookie pool and taking the fourth-best quarterback in the draft? You can look like Atlanta with (Desmond) Ridder pretty quick.”

6. Two-minute drill: There were already many ways to win a game before the Dolphins invented another one.

The Dolphins were one of 223 teams since 2000 to be favored by at least 13.5 points in a regular-season or playoff game. Seventeen of those 223 teams fell behind by 14 or more. Six of the 17 won anyway. The Dolphins were the only one of those 223 teams to win and cover the spread, which was 13.5 for this game.

• Six catches for 163 yards and a touchdown against Carolina left the Dolphins’ Tyreek Hill with 812 yards through the first six games. That ranks second in NFL history to Hall of Famer Don Hutson, who had 819 yards through six with Green Bay in 1942.

Receiving Yards Through Six NFL Games Rk Player Season Yds 1 Don Hutson 1942 819 2 Tyreek Hill 2023 812 3 Wes Welker 2011 785 4 Elroy Hirsch 1951 766 5 Santana Moss 2005 743 6 DeAndre Hopkins 2015 726 7 Raymond Berry 1960 725 8 Jerry Rice 1986 723 9 Bob Boyd 1954 718 10 Bobby Mitchell 1962 714

• Jared Goff is enjoying the second-best start to a season for his career from a statistical standpoint, behind only his 2018 Super Bowl season with the Rams. With the Lions at 5-1 and Goff heading toward a likely contract extension, could another team come after his injured backup, former University of Tennessee quarterback Hendon Hooker?

Randy Mueller raised the thought last week, recalling examples from his career as a GM when offering a pick one round higher than a prospect’s actual draft round proved alluring. Detroit used a third-round choice for Hooker, who is recovering from ACL surgery. Hooker would have been valued higher if healthy. Could that be true again at some point in the future?

• News that Indianapolis Colts rookie quarterback Anthony Richardson might undergo season-ending shoulder surgery could carry a silver lining. Richardson got to play enough for the Colts to evaluate where he stands, but if he shuts it down for the season, neither he nor the team would have to suffer through a full season of growing pains. Gardner Minshew’s three-pick game against Jacksonville on Sunday works against the idea Indy is better positioned to compete with the journeyman in the lineup, but most coaches and execs I’ve spoken with believe that to be the case in the short term.

sports,Sloan Piva,2023-12-07T22:09:00+00:00,"Happy December, fantasy friends! We have somehow reached the final week of the fantasy football regular season, so the running back decisions we make in our PPR leagues this week could very well impact our playoff fate. Our Week 14 fantasy RB PPR rankings will help you optimize your lineup at RB1, RB2, and flex heading into this crucial weekend.

It hasn't been all holly, jolly this season — in fact, it has often been a bumpy sleigh ride. We've suffered a plethora of injuries to stud RBs the past few weeks, but we keep rolling with the punches and always do our best to stay two steps ahead of our opponents. One major positive is that only two teams will be on bye this week, a welcome relief after the six-team byepocalypse that was Week 13. Still, the injury-ravaged teams will have trouble replacing their studs and the deep squads will have difficult start 'em, sit 'em decisions to make.

As we do every week, we're deep-diving the running back position and analyzing all the stats, matchups, and injuries before breaking down our rankings. So, let's get to it and survey the RB landscape for the final week of the fantasy regular season.

Which RBs are on bye in Week 14?

After a whopping six teams were on bye last week, only the Commanders and Cardinals will be off in Week 14. That takes Brian Robinson Jr. and James Conner off the table, but it doesn't hurt us much beyond that.

WEEK 14 PPR RANKINGS:

QBs | WRs | TEs | D/STs | Kickers

It does hurt a bit to have two below-average run defenses off the table, as Washington and Arizona have both ranked among the 10 most generous teams to RBs this season.

WEEK 14 STANDARD RANKINGS:

QBs | RBs | WRs | TEs | D/STs | Kickers

Who are the best fantasy RBs in Week 14?

Christian McCaffrey (vs. Seahawks in Week 14) has given us no reason to stop believing in him as the best overall player in the NFL, so he stays atop this list. Austin Ekeler (vs. Broncos) has started to give us some pause as of late, as he's averaged fewer than 3.0 yards per carry since coming off IR eight games ago, but a juicy home matchup against Denver should be his get-right game. Clear skies ahead, Ek owners — the Broncos have surrendered the most PPR points in the NFL to RBs, and L.A. faces them twice between now and the fantasy title week.

With Jacksonville playing very well over the past month, we're all-in on Travis Etienne Jr. (@ Browns) even in a tough matchup. Trevor Lawrence and his high-flying offense should dominate the time of possession against the Joe Flacco-led Browns, leaving ETN plenty of opportunities to add to his per-game PPR average of 17.4 points (third best in the NFL entering Week 13).

Guess who's back? Back again? Achane's back — tell a friend! Stud rookie De'Von Achane (vs. Titans) went right back to roughing up the opposition in his Week 13 return from a knee injury that sidelined him one week prior. The potential league-winner casually put up 103 yards and two TDs on the Commanders, and we can't help but place him and running mate Raheem Mostert in the top five this week despite a somewhat-tough matchup with Tennessee. Mostert has more PPR points than everyone but CMC, while Achane ranks just two spots behind CMC at third in PPR points per game (20.6).

Another stud duo, Detroit's Jahmyr Gibbs and David Montgomery (@ Bears), also makes our top 10. They ravaged Chicago when they last met a few weeks ago, combining for a total of 193 yards and two TDs, and we have no reason to think the Lions will slow down in Week 13. Dan Campbell's squad just put 142 rushing yards and 33 points on the Saints in the Bayou this past weekend.

Speaking of New Orleans, old PPR reliable Alvin Kamara (vs. Panthers) has been a source of light for an otherwise-dismal Saints offense. With Derek Carr suffering a brutal blow in the Week 13 loss to Detroit, Kamara will likely shoulder the load against Carolina and its atrocious run defense. Entering Week 13, only two teams had allowed more PPR points than the Panthers (28.9 FPPG).

We also love Saquon Barkley (vs. Packers) against the Packers' leaky run defense and Breece Hall (vs. Texans) in what should be a bounce-back game. Entering Week 13, Houston had allowed 112.9 scrimmage yards per game and nine total TDs to RBs on the year.

WEEK 14 FANTASY ADVICE:

Sleepers | Busts | Projections | Start-sit

Who are the best fantasy RB sleepers, waiver pickups Week 14?

Welcome to the top 25, Tyjae Spears (@ Dolphins)! We've loved the way this kid has run all season. He averaged 5.1 yards per carry entering last weekend, and he stepped up in a major way for Tennessee when Derrick Henry sustained a game-ending hit to the head area against Indy. Spears contributed 20 yards on the game-tying drive in the fourth quarter and another 27 yards in OT, but Mike Vrabel's squad ultimately lost. In what should be a high-scoring game against the Super Bowl-hopeful 'Fins, we like Spears to be busy as rookie QB Will Levis's top check-down option -- assuming Henry (head/neck) is out, of course.

Ezekiel Elliott (@ Steelers) is another potential fill-in who should produce at least flex-worthy stats this week. With Rhamondre Stevenson (ankle) on the shelf, Elliott could see 20 touches. Similarly, Kenneth Gainwell (@ Cowboys) and Roschon Johnson (vs. Lions) could see big upticks in touches if D'Andre Swift and D'Onta Foreman can't suit up, but we're not as confident those backs can produce given their matchups.

We still like Jaylen Warren better overall, but you can confidently take Najee Harris (vs. Patriots) out of the doghouse for good. Harris has been running with purpose, and his role in the passing game continues to make him a high-ceiling RB2 in a run-first offense that will be without Kenny Pickett (ankle) this week. New England might be banged up, but it's still a tough D to get chunk yardage against through the air. Look for Harris to see lots of screens and dump-downs in a rough-and-tumble Thursday night game in Pittsburgh.

We love Baltimore's Keaton Mitchell (vs. Rams) and think he has the potential to smash Los Angeles at home this week. The speedster has quietly racked up over 300 yards and two TDs over the Ravens' past four games, and with Lamar Jackson facing Aaron Donald and a still-talented pass-rush, John Harbaugh's squad might turn to the rookie to move the chains between the 20s. All we need is one or two big chunk gains to make him a worthwhile start — he can run friggin' 22 miles per hour!

WEEK 14 DFS:

DK lineup | FD lineup | Best values | Best stacks

Who are the biggest potential fantasy RB busts in Week 14?

While he just barely cracks our top 25 thanks to his passing-down usage, James Cook (@ Chiefs) doesn't thrill us at Arrowhead against the pissed-off defending champs. Kansas City's front-seven has been tough against speedsters and more vulnerable to power backs, and the 5-11, 190-pound Cook 100 percent falls into the former category. Temper your expectations.

We feel the same way about Zach Charbonnet (@ 49ers). It's great that the Week 13 injury he sustained on Thursday night was just a bruise, but it's not great that he now faces a 49ers defense that already stifled him on Thanksgiving. You're probably starting him if Kenneth Walker III remains out with his oblique injury, but consider other options if you have the depth. The floor and ceiling remain low against this uber-confident Niners D.

Tyler Allgeier (vs. Buccaneers) continues to see his role diminish for the NFC South-leading Falcons, with dum-dum coach Arthur Smith finally realizing that Bijan Robinson gives the ATL the best chance at continued success. Tampa Bay has a pretty good run defense, so Allgeier can't be trusted outside of a desperate flex play with his nine average touches over the past two weeks.

What are the biggest RB injuries in Week 14?

Derrick Henry (head/neck), Rhamondre Stevenson (ankle), Kenneth Walker III (oblique), Aaron Jones (knee), D'Onta Foreman (ankle), and D'Andre Swift (undisclosed) are all ""questionable,"" at best, to suit up this week. We know for sure Stevenson will be out, but we'll have to monitor the injury reports throughout the week for the rest.

Jonathan Taylor (thumb) underwent surgery last week and will miss the next few weeks, opening the door for Zack Moss to resume his role as Indy's super-sub lead back.

We'll be updating these RB PPR rankings all week, so check back for the latest player movement.

sports,The New York Times,2023-12-15T21:32:52+00:00,"LAUDERDALE-BY-THE-SEA, Fla. — The Buffalo Bills have a new safety this season.

He sometimes plays close to the line of scrimmage, even lining up in the gaps and banging helmets with interior linemen. They use him as a hybrid linebacker in a three-safety dime package. He has played free safety, strong safety, outside cornerback, inside cornerback, left linebacker and right linebacker. And more.

Advertisement

Physically and mentally, he is being challenged, but he’s grateful, content and all in.

The Bills’ new safety is Jordan Poyer. It’s the same Jordan Poyer who played for the team the previous six seasons, the only player in the NFL to have 500 or more tackles, 20 or more interceptions and 10 or more sacks in that time frame, a Bills captain for the fourth time, an Ed Block Courage Award winner in 2017, a Pro Bowl safety last year and an All-Pro the year before.

But this is a new Jordan Poyer because of ayahuasca.

In the spring of 2020, NFL team facilities were closed because of COVID-19, so Bills defenders met in Washington, D.C., for a few days to train, study and bond.

The first evening, cornerback Josh Norman welcomed the players to his home, and out came the shots of tequila. When Poyer was handed a shot, he looked at it and then at his teammates.

He put it down.

Norman and the others, who had never seen him turn down a drink, were taken aback.

“What?” one said. “Come on, Deejay Poyo!”

Deejay Poyo was Poyer’s alter ego. Inspired by tequila and a turntable, Poyer became someone else. And for Poyer, there was value in being someone else.

What his teammates didn’t know was that Poyer had not put alcohol to his lips in about three months, since he downed a shot of tequila on March 13 in the Puerto Vallarta airport bar during a 12-hour flight delay.

Poyer spent his childhood in Astoria, Ore., a picturesque town on the mouth of the Columbia River not far from the Pacific Ocean. His mother and stepfather worked at a juvenile detention center and raised him with a strict hand. When he was no longer under their watch, unsupervised as a freshman at Oregon State, Poyer drank. And drank and drank.

It never seemed to affect his play in college, where he was a consensus All-American. And despite his continued drinking, he made steady progress in his early NFL years.

GO DEEPER Graham: Bills rally around Sean McDermott in another win over Chiefs

In his third season, when he was an emerging starter with the Cleveland Browns, he DM’d an Instagram model after she liked one of his posts on Twitter. She was a freshman at Florida Atlantic, a small-town girl from the Adirondacks who knew nothing about football but thought Poyer was cute. He traveled to Florida to meet her, and before the weekend was over, Poyer declared, “I’m going to marry this girl.”

Poyer made numerous trips to Florida that offseason. That spring as Rachel Bush was finishing her freshman year of college, she learned she was pregnant. After their daughter, Aliyah, was born, Poyer signed with the Bills, and the family moved to Buffalo. He and Rachel married in 2018.

His drinking was out of control by then. He would down a six-pack of IPAs in 20 to 30 minutes for a quick buzz. Blacking out was a regular occurrence. His behavior tested his marriage, but there was a draw between him and Rachel like a north pole to south.

After the Bills lost to the Houston Texans in the wild-card round of the 2019 playoffs, Poyer was crestfallen. He says he drank heavily every day for five weeks. At one point Rachel rid their home of all alcohol, but he would still sneak what he could.

Rachel says her husband hid alcohol from her beneath bathroom cabinets and other places “like a child.”

He was close to losing her.

The drinking, he realized, was an attempt to relieve stress — stress from football expectations and stress from family life. He was a worrier, except with a drink in his hand.

Poyer went to an Alcoholics Anonymous meeting. Then another, and another.

The get-together at Norman’s house was his first significant temptation.

“When I put that drink down for the first time, it was almost like I overcame a demon,” Poyer says.

The more time that passed, the less Poyer wanted to drink. He has no desire for it now, and the smell of alcohol almost makes him gag.

Despite a stellar career and a loving family, Bills safety Jordan Poyer “felt like there was something missing” as recently as last year. (Dan Pompei / The Athletic)

Being sober didn’t make him immune to anxiety and depression, however. In the 2022 season, he missed five games with elbow, foot, knee and rib injuries. When the Bills lost to the Bengals in the divisional playoff round, Poyer felt responsible for not doing more.

And his angst ran deeper than football.

“I still felt like there was something missing because I have this beautiful house, a beautiful family, everything anyone could ask for,” he says. “I still felt a sense of unhappiness, a sense of not understanding who I was, and why I was the way I was. A part of me felt guilty just because I was living this way.”

Poyer couldn’t come to terms with why, despite all his shortcomings, he was in such an enviable position. His football journey was improbable. No major college wanted him until Oregon State came in with a late offer to grayshirt, meaning his scholarship wouldn’t begin until January of his freshman year. He was chosen in the seventh round of the 2013 NFL draft, came into the league as a cornerback, was cut six games into his rookie season and then had to learn a new position with a new team. He took a blind-side hit that put him in the hospital for two days with a lacerated kidney and a concussion. His career could have been over then.

Yet by now he has outlasted 191 of the 217 players drafted ahead of him. And he hasn’t just survived in the NFL — he has thrived.

What had he done to deserve this?

Was he justifying his good fortune?

Would there be a greater purpose?

In 2018, Poyer saw a therapist for anxiety once a week. It was unfulfilling.

The answers were somewhere else.

In the Quechua language, ayahuasca (pronounced ‘eye-ah-WAH-ska’) means “vine of the soul.”

Ayahuasca is a psychedelic drug made from the leaves of the Psychotria viridis shrub and the stalks of the Banisteriopsis caapi vine. It has been used for more than a thousand years by Amazonian tribes. Ingesting it can induce a dreamlike feeling, an altered state of consciousness, mystical experiences and euphoria.

In the summer of 2022, Aaron Rodgers revealed he had taken ayahuasca and credited it with helping him have two of the best seasons of his career for the Packers.

Poyer had never heard of ayahuasca at the time. “My first thought was eff that,” Poyer says. “You crazy? I’m not doing that.”

The funny word kept showing up in different conversations on his social media feeds and podcasts. Poyer researched it and became intrigued.

After the difficult 2022 season, Rachel suggested Poyer take a “guys trip” after the season to check out. But “guys trips” usually involve alcohol, and he didn’t want that. Sightseeing isn’t his thing. “What I really wanted to do was work on trying to be a better me,” he says.

He discovered Resonance, a retreat center in Costa Rica on a hilltop overlooking the Pacific coast and the cloud forest of Monteverde.

To prepare his mind to enter a state of awareness, he was to eat only chicken, fish and salad for one month, with no oils and sugar added. Then he had to cut out chicken and fish for the week preceding the ceremony. He also was told to practice yoga and breathing exercises that would be useful if he experienced anxiety during the three ceremonies spread over a week.

In a tiki hut in a wooded, secluded area, a shaman presented each participant with a cup of ayahuasca brew, which is kind of like tea, but with benefits. Taste is not one of them. Poyer says ayahuasca tastes like earth.

“It’s brownish and really thick,” he says. “It almost looks like oil, but it’s darker and thicker. It’s one of the worst things you could ever taste.”

For the first hour after swigging it down, he lay in a bean bag chair in silence, setting intentions. Poyer’s intentions were to understand himself better and love better. Eventually, the shaman provided a second cup, and then, enchantment.

“At first what it felt like was my soul left my body for a good two minutes,” Poyer says.

Initially, it was unsettling.

“People try to control it, but you can’t,” Poyer says. “It took me about five or 10 minutes to figure it out. The ego has to die so the medicine can work. In order to let go and let the medicine do what it’s supposed to do, we have to just breathe.”

For about the next hour, Poyer says the highest version of himself lectured him out loud. It was, in his word, “crazy.” First, highest-version Poyer addressed his desire to understand himself better.

“He was basically saying, ‘Jordan, look at your life, bro — what are you mad at?’ ” Poyer says. “It was what I needed to hear because I wasn’t appreciating anything — not my wife, my daughter, my family, my house. It was all about me and what I wanted.”

Then he turned to loving better. It was, he says, as if a Pandora’s box opened on how to love.

The remainder of the ceremonies, which lasted nine hours each, were about curiosity, energy and connectedness.

“It’s about how to be a good human,” he says. “And it grounds you. Really grounds you.”

Two days before OTAs began last April, Poyer returned to the Bills’ headquarters and stepped on the scale. The needle settled at 179 pounds, about 20 pounds below his playing weight.

After resuming his regular routine, the weight came back quickly.

He discussed his experience with curious teammates, coaches and the team psychologist. Poyer hoped ayahuasca would elevate his football performances as Rodgers believes it did his, but it hasn’t worked that way for him.

He is the second-leading tackler on his team but hasn’t made as many big plays as he would like. What he has done, according to former Bills defensive coordinator Les Frazier, now an analyst for NFL Network, is enable his defense to be the best it can by lifting others through versatility, sacrifice, toughness and communication. Poyer wears his “C” well.

“I feel like I’m playing OK this year,” Poyer said during the Bills’ bye week on the patio of his Florida home. “I’m not playing the best that I’ve played in my career. There are probably two plays I really want back. But I’m doing a lot. And in a very deep sense, I absolutely love that I’m entrusted with doing as much as I’m doing on this defense.”

Ayahuasca gifted him in another way — with perspective.

Ego is a powerful force in professional athletes. It helps them ascend and often hastens their downfalls. In previous seasons, Poyer believes his responses to successes and failures were too ego-driven. Football was him — he has an NFL logo tattooed on his left shoulder — and he was football.

Not anymore.

“We still have games left that I’m excited about, but I knew some way, somehow, this universe was going to test me this year,” he says. “We lost DaQuan Jones, Matt Milano and Tre’Davious White for the season. It’s hard. This s— is hard. And it’s not just (the losses). I’m 32, not this young spring chicken anymore. You know, s— hurts all the time. But my perspective is I get to play a game that I love, and I’m healthy enough to play. Every time you come out of a game, that’s a win in its own way.”

Poyer’s commitment is such that last season, when a rib injury precluded him from airplane travel, he took a 32-hour round-trip drive to play in a game in Kansas City. He wants to lift a Lombardi Trophy badly, as much as ever. But if it doesn’t happen, he believes he can handle the disappointment better.

On Fridays this season, Poyer, fellow safety Taylor Rapp and assistant strength coach Will Greenberg play crystal bowls at Bills headquarters. “The different tones that you can tune into can enhance chakras within you and help you heal,” he says.

Healing takes many forms.

When Poyer was 12, Louis Dunbar, who has done multiple stints in prison for violent crimes, called him for the first time and stunned him with the revelation he was his biological father. In subsequent conversations, Dunbar often said he wanted to see him or come to one of his games. He never has.

“I always had this hate and resentment toward him I was holding,” says Poyer, who doesn’t know where Dunbar is. “This experience enabled me to let that go. I realize I wouldn’t have anything — my daughter and my wife — if not for him. Even if it was just the seed he gave my mom. So someday I’ll meet him, give him a hug and tell him I’m sorry.”

Rachel has no interest in taking ayahuasca. But she is grateful her husband discovered it.

“After he did ayahuasca, he became like my dream husband,” Rachel says. “I was nervous about what it would do to him, but he came back a totally new man, so appreciative of me and our family.”

Highest-version Poyer made Poyer aware he was not doing the little things — waking up with a smile, giving Rachel a hug on his way out, or being present even when his attention could be divided.

Poyer has turned off his DMs on Instagram and deleted his Twitter/X account. Instagram features a For You page — a personalized feed based on user engagement patterns. In the past, Poyer’s was filled with posts of other girls, according to Rachel. Now there’s nothing on Poyer’s For You page except football and ayahuasca. She knows because they have one another’s passwords.

“His attention now is 100 percent on me, his family and his career,” says Rachel, who has more than 4 million Instagram followers, an OnlyFans page and a line of skincare products.

Some players feel more pressure when the end is closer than the beginning. The Bills have an out in Poyer’s contract after this season. He isn’t stressing about any of it. His focus is here and now.

Poyer has thought about becoming a football commentator after retirement. But he has more to offer than sports talk. He could talk about why he’s never had a vaccine, why Aliyah is homeschooled, or how he believes God transcends religions.

He could discuss why he has always thought he might be an alien. “I truly feel like I’m not from this planet, always being the odd one out, having different perspectives, thinking differently,” says Poyer, who is fascinated by stars.

Poyer has what philosophers call epistemic humility — he believes knowledge is limited and filtered by personal experiences. And now he is beginning to solve the mysteries of his existence.

“My life has been changed forever,” he says. “And my purpose is to be a bright light for everybody that I touch and connect with.”

In March, Poyer will return to Resonance for another retreat. Also planning to go are his cousin who went with him last year, and some first-timers — his mother, brother, a couple of friends and possibly a couple of teammates. He will be working on a documentary about ayahuasca.

A handpan is a steel musical instrument that generates sound through vibrations. Sound healers and meditators often play the handpan. In Costa Rica, Poyer heard one for the first time and was drawn to it. Now he plays his frequently.

Not long ago, Rachel returned home at about 10 p.m. and was tidying up the kitchen when, in the peace of the night, she heard something coming from the outside balcony upstairs — ethereal, haunting sounds.

“It was kind of like something you would hear in a dream,” Rachel says.

It was music the old Jordan Poyer never could have made.

sports,Edward Sutelan,2023-10-13T21:58:11+00:00,"It had been reported Monday night when the Braves beat the Phillies in Game 2 of the NLDS, ending on a critical base-running play involving Bryce Harper, that Atlanta shortstop Orlando Arcia taunted about the Phillies' star in the clubhouse after the game.

That report wound up generating plenty of controversy.

Fox Sports' Jake Mintz, one of the two brothers that runs the popular Cespedes Family BBQ account, reported that Arcia had been celebrating after Atlanta's 5-4 win by saying ""Atta boy Harper"" in the Braves' clubhouse, jeering at the fact that Harper was doubled off on the basepaths after an outstanding catch by Michael Harris in center field and an impressive relay to get Harper at first to end the game.

The comments wound up coming back to bite the Braves two days later, with Harper homering twice — staring down Arcia after each — as he powered the Phillies to the 10-2 Game 3 win. When the Phillies beat the Braves in Game 4 to eliminate Atlanta and advance to the NLCS, players in the Philadelphia clubhouse celebrated by repeating, ""Atta boy Harper.""

While the comments became a spark for the Phillies, it also became a subject of controversy. Players, including the Blue Jays' Kevin Gausman, decried the situation as a mistake by Mintz to report the comments, which were said out loud in the locker room rather than said in an interview setting. Others defended the situation, saying that anything in the clubhouse is open to be reported on.

MORE: Why Arcia's comments motivated Harper after NLDS Game 2

But perhaps the biggest backlash came from MLB Network's Alanna Rizzo, who blasted Mintz on ""High Heat"" for reporting on the incident. Following a BBWAA statement, Rizzo both publicly and privately apologized to Mintz for her reaction.

Here's what you need to know about the controversy.

Bryce Harper Atta Boy controversy, explained

It all begins with the play. In Game 2, Harper led off the top of the ninth in a one-run game with a walk. J.T. Realmuto flew out to center for the first out, but on the next play, Nick Castellanos lifted a deep fly into right-center. It appeared it would be extra bases, and if Harper took off, he'd be able to score the tying run on the play.

The problem for the Phillies was that Harris made a leaping grab up against the wall to rob Castellanos of the hit. Harper had well since rounded second on his way to third, but the throw from Harris missed both cut-off men by second. Austin Riley, however, ran in and scooped the ball and made an impressive throw to Matt Olson to nab Harper and end the game.

After the game, Mintz wrote a well-reported story on how the Braves pulled off the improbable comeback, coming back from down four runs at one point, to win the game, and deep in the article, wrote the following:

Kevin Pillar's young son, sporting a custom ""Money Mike"" headband, waddled over to his favorite center fielder for a fist bump. Third-string catcher Chadwick Tromp strutted by Harris' locker offering a congratulatory ""Mike is him!"" All while Braves shortstop Orlando Arcia cackled emphatically about Harper's misfortune, bellowing ""ha-ha, atta-boy, Harper!"" repeatedly as reporters circled the room.

As Mintz pointed out, he was not the only one to allude to the celebration from Arcia. The Washington Post's Chelsea Janes also wrote about it, saying that one of Harris' teammates was yelling, ""Atta boy Harper."" The only difference was that Janes did not name the player.

The reporting of Arcia's comments proved to be divisive across the baseball community. Among the most prominent to call out Mintz was Rizzo. The ""High Heat"" co-host said she was irritated by ""bloggers or podcasters"" going into the clubhouse and ""ruining it for the rest of us"" when ""some jackoff comes in at the end of the season that gets a credential, God only knows why."" She called the clubhouse ""a sacred place"" and defended the players who were upset by the reporting of Arcia's comments, before she called Mintz out by name.

""First of all, this guy, Jake Mintz, that's not even a reporter,"" Rizzo said. ""That's taking away from true reporters and true journalists. Where were you on the random Tuesday in April in Cincinnati when this team was playing in Cincinnati? Where were you on a rain delay, and you have to sit in the press box for all of this time? It's ridiculous.""

Alanna Rizzo went off on Jake Mintz's clubhouse reporting on MLBN's ""High Heat"" Thursday. pic.twitter.com/6dooqeLPnh — Awful Announcing (@awfulannouncing) October 12, 2023

Rizzo's comments immediately drew heat from the baseball journalism world, including from Janes, who posted a thread defending Mintz. Janes reported that cameras and recorders were recording, and that Arcia yelled the comments while they were recording and with more than a dozen reporters around. She said that reporters abstaining from writing on his comments would be akin to ""protecting players from themselves.""

She also went on to say that what Arcia said wasn't a slur or hateful, and added the only reason anyone was concerned about it was because ""they know it would motivate Harper to beat [the Braves]. Which implies the Braves do not feel they can handle a motivated Bryce Harper and are willing to suggest that is why they lost the other day.""

""I didn't say something sooner because I thought this was overblown,"" Janes continued. ""And frankly, I thought it wouldn't help. But I am genuinely disgusted by the way some media members are acting like a reporter was in the wrong for this. He wasn't.

""And if the Braves let this be the story of their series, that's on them. Win and it goes away. Period.""

The incident elicited a response from the Baseball Writers Association of American (BBWAA), which defended Mintz, a BBWAA member.

""For the record, Jake is a BBWAA member in good standing and has earned the right to be credentialed through his hard work and quality baseball coverage,"" the BBWAA wrote in the statement. ""To assert otherwise, in vulgar terms, is both unprofessional and unacceptable. The BBWAA is deeply troubled that the league's own network would permit the disparaging of one of our members in this fashion. Scrutinizing our work is part of the territory but comments such as these should have no place on MLBN.""

Following the backlash to her comments, Rizzo apologized on ""High Heat"" to Mintz and the BBWAA. She said her comments were ""completely inappropriate, it was inaccurate and it was beyond unprofessional. I got caught up in the heat of the moment.""

""What I said was completely off base and I've had an interesting 24 hours and I've learned a lot more and I apologize to Jake. I talked to him already, I apologized to him privately and I also apologize to him publicly,"" Rizzo said. ""They do a good job in the clubhouse and I was completely inaccurate in my assessment of what went down there.""

Alanna Rizzo gave ""a very heartfelt apology to Jake Mintz and the entire BBWAA"" pic.twitter.com/rT9tjSWLY3 — Awful Announcing (@awfulannouncing) October 13, 2023

Mintz, though calling her initial comments ""incredibly hurtful/uncalled for,"" wrote on X saying that he was ""glad she apologized,"" and asked people not to toss hate to her.

""Thanks to all the reporters, journos, baseball twitter weirdos, acquaintances and friends who had my back over the last 48 hours,"" Mintz wrote. ""And also, of course, the BBWAA. Community feels good, humbled to be a part of this one. Now, let's enjoy some ball.""","Bryce Harper 'Atta Boy' controversy, explained: Why Orlando Arcia's comments led to backlash, Alanna Rizzo rant",https://www.sportingnews.com/us/mlb/news/bryce-harper-atta-boy-controversy-orlando-arcia-comments/0fe0f26efb69bc8b012216ad,Sporting News
sports,Jamie Jackson,2023-10-28T21:30:25+00:00,"Erik ten Hag smiles when asked if André Onana can be the “holding midfielder” for Manchester United described in Uefa’s technical report of the goalkeeper’s display for Internazionale in May’s Champions League final.

“First the job of a keeper is to save, is to [guard] his goal, that’s his main job and don’t forget this,” says United’s manager. “But, yeah, he is a keeper who we can use as an extra player and if we are developing [more] he can be more progressive and even higher up the pitch – an extra player, so that’s an advantage.”

Onana’s last game for the Italian club was the 1-0 defeat by Manchester City in Istanbul as United’s crosstown rivals claimed a first Champions League and so clinched the treble. Yet if he has recent experience of facing Pep Guardiola’s side, the 27-year-old will be a derby debutant against City in Sunday’s 191st edition of the local squabble that will attract a global audience of millions.

Uefa’s description of Onana intrigues because it suggests that what Guardiola introduced to the domestic game – a No 1 in Ederson who performs as a de facto extra defender to maintain fluidity along the backline – has evolved further. The goalkeeper was so advanced as to be a No 6 (rather than, the technical report posited, a “sweeper-keeper”) who can take up residence in the middle third of his half as his team pushes deep into enemy territory.

Onana did so against City for Internazionale but has this encounter with the champions come too soon for him to function as “the extra man” Ten Hag identifies? “It also depends on the opposition, how strong is the press, for instance, and how good is the team around him,” the United manager says.

“So if it’s possible – in my philosophy he has to do it every game [but] it is not always possible, so you have to adapt and this what I make clear. Even if you’re not playing well, if the team is not playing well, or you’re not playing to the standards you expect, you still have to win – so find a way to win, be pragmatic.”

United have been so of late, claiming victories over Sheffield United, Brentford and FC Copenhagen in their last three matches. But Ten Hag’s “depends on the opposition” and “how good is the team around him” comments sound like hints. In contrast to Inter’s Simone Inzaghi, the United manager may harbour doubts about deploying Onana high up the pitch against City.

The Dutchman is still building his team and may be wary of the uneven form of United’s new keeper. Bought for £47.2m, Onana arrived on a ticket of being a high-grade shot-stopper, technically impressive too with the ball at his feet. But until impressing against Brentford and Copenhagen, Onana had bombed, costing United goals and points.

“Certain things [here] are different,” shrugs Ten Hag when asked why the No 1 is taking time to settle in England. “OK it is 11-v-11, and it is about attacking, defending, transition. But there is more: the approach to the game, the speed of the game, the intensity. The varieties in styles. So there is absolutely a difference and players need to adjust, need time to do so.”

Last season’s derby at Old Trafford ended in a 2-1 win for United. Bruno Fernandes’s equaliser was controversial with Marcus Rashford offside but not so the goal was chalked off as he had not touched the ball. So far this term the captain has scored two goals in 12 United appearances and Ten Hag has no doubt he can be a major factor in Sunday’s showdown.

“If he does [score] again, I’ll be happy,” the manager says. “Bruno is an [effective] player when we have a lot of the ball. Then he is at his best. And there are games against top teams when you have less of the ball. So then it is about taking benefit from [any attacking] moments and for the rest you have to work hard for the team. And to get a result because that is the most important, that the team is winning.”

This is what Ten Hag has overseen in recent weeks as the protracted sale of the club has entered a new phase, with Sir Jim Ratcliffe’s bid to buy 25% for an inflated £1.3bn in return for control of football policy expected to go through imminently. But despite any implications this may have for the futures of Ten Hag’s players, the manager himself does not think the matter is a distraction.

“Of course, they are committed to the club but especially they are committed to this team,” Ten Hag says. “They want to be successful and are therefore aware you need [to focus on] the team, your teammates. That is how the players are thinking and they are not thinking about strategic reviews or structures or whatever.”

WEEK 14 FANTASY ADVICE:

Sleepers | Busts | Projections | Start-sit

DraftKings Picks Week 14: NFL DFS lineup for GPP tournaments

Sunday main slate, $50,000 budget

QB Justin Fields, Bears vs. Lions ($6,800). The Lions might have control over the NFC North, but their defense is losing steam as the season progresses. Detroit appeared well on their way to a dominant victory over New Orleans until they let the corpse of the 2023 Saints march back into it, nearly taking a lead (which is alarming with this version of Derek Carr leading the charge). Fields recently had success against the divisional foe, rushing for 104 yards and tossing a touchdown in Week 11. The dual-threat QB should be in line for a great day at home.

RB Christian McCaffrey, 49ers vs. Seahawks ($9,200). Sometimes, you just have to splurge and live a little. Fantasy's best RB has been a little rich for us all season, but now is the time to strike. The 49ers are coming off an emotional win over the Eagles after stomping the Seahawks on Thanksgiving. They are trying to track down the top spot in the NFC and will continue to lean on their stars. McCaffrey just rushed over 100 yards and two touchdowns against this same defense two weeks ago, and his floor remains at the penthouse with a ceiling that stretches to the moon -- the place we hope to be going with him in the lineup.

WEEK 14 DFS: FD lineup | Best values | Best stacks

RB Alvin Kamara, Saints vs. Panthers ($8,200). The Saints have a QB problem and the offense is stuck in quicksand more often than not. Derek Carr will likely be out with a concussion, leaving Jameis Winston to start. The Winston experience is certainly not for the faint of heart, but it's undoubtedly exciting. Kamara remains a fixture in the offense as arguably the team's top runner and receiver, thanks to his work as a security blanket for whichever QB is under center. The Panthers remain terrible at defending RBs, giving Kamara the perfect landing spot to build on what was a solid Week 13. We can pencil him in for at least 100 total yards and a touchdown.

WR DJ Moore, Bears vs. Lions ($6,500). Fields' chemistry with Moore is fairly obvious by now. The connection continues to shine with each passing week, totaling 210 yards over the past two games in addition to scoring a TD. We're especially fond of the 22 targets with a leaky secondary once again on tap. Moore cooked the Lions to the tune of almost 23 fantasy points in Week 12, and being well-rested off the bye means we're likely to see more of the same.

WEEK 14 PPR RANKINGS:

QBs | RBs | WRs | TEs | D/STs | Kickers

WR Drake London, Falcons vs. Buccaneers ($4,600). When we see the Buccaneers on the schedule, we immediately look to see what WR1 is going to have a big day. It wasn't the greatest feeling in the world seeing the Falcons this week, but we're confident in London's ability to make this pick worth our while. He hauled in six-of-seven targets for 54 yards and almost added a score in Week 7 against Tampa, indicating history is on our side here. Because we splurged for McCaffrey and Kamara, we had to sacrifice salary elsewhere, and London is a high-upside option even in an offense that doesn't throw the ball with efficiency.

WR Jaxon Smith-Njigba, Seahawks @ 49ers ($4,100). Is a takeover underway in the Seahawks offense? Smith-Njigba is coming off a game against the Cowboys that saw him collect seven-of-11 targets for 62 yards. It's a step up from a disappointing outing against San Francisco, but Tyler Lockett's involvement seems to be lessening as of late with the rookie stepping up. It wasn't a great day for the Seattle offense on Thanksgiving against the Niners, but the Seahawks should put up a better effort against a divisional opponent they know so well. If they're trailing, JSN should see action with a negative game script.

WEEK 14 STANDARD RANKINGS:

QBs | RBs | WRs | TEs | D/STs | Kickers

TE Brevin Jordan, Texans @ Jets ($3,100). Jordan was a great streaming option and fill-in for the crowd that lost Dalton Schultz (hamstring) on Sunday, hauling in three-of-four targets for 64 yards against the Broncos. If Schultz is out again, Jordan is a serviceable option that has touchdown upside against a reeling Jets team that is busy booking vacations or plotting how to find themselves on a different roster in 2024. If Schultz does play, we'll pivot to the Jets' Tyler Conklin, who is $100 less and has plenty of opportunity in an even better matchup.

FLEX WR Jameson Williams, Lions @ Bears ($3,500). As we come down to the last remaining dollars of our Week 14 budget, we need to take some swings and hope that the wind blows in our direction. What better way to approach this than with a pick from the game in the Windy City? Williams typically has around three chances a game to make a big play, something he's delivered on in two of the past three weeks -- including against the Bears two weeks ago. He's the perfect boom-or-bust target in a game that could feature a lot of points like it did last time.

DEF Texans @ Jets ($4,000). We're right back to exploiting the Jets' offense since it's one of the few that we can trust to score fewer than 10 points every week. With Zach Wilson reportedly reluctant to play and further destroy a career hanging on by a thread, that leaves us with Tim Boyle, Trevor Siemian, or the lucky fan from Section 139 to lead the Jets to yet another embarrassing defeat. As the Texans try to make a playoff push, this one could get ugly.

sports,"Josh Erickson, Pro Hockey Rumors",2023-11-27T23:45:08+00:00,"The Wild have relieved head coach Dean Evason and assistant coach Bob Woods of their duties effective immediately, the team said in a statement Monday evening. The Athletic’s Michael Russo reports the Wild will be naming former Devils and Predators bench boss John Hynes as Evason’s successor.

Wild GM Bill Guerin gave the following comment:

""Dean did an excellent job during his tenure with the Minnesota Wild, especially as Head Coach of our team. I am very thankful for his hard work and dedication to our organization. I would also like to thank Bob for his hard work during his time as an Assistant Coach with the Wild. I wish Dean, Bob and their families all the best in the future.""

Evason had been a member of the Wild organization since he was brought on as an assistant in 2018, while Woods joined the Wild bench one season prior. The 59-year-old Evason began his coaching career with the WHL’s Calgary Hitmen as an assistant in 1998-99 after finishing out his playing career in Germany, working his way up the junior hockey ranks over the next handful of seasons. His first NHL job came courtesy of an assistant role with the Capitals immediately after the 2004-05 lockout, coaching Alex Ovechkin in his first seven NHL seasons.

After departing Washington in 2012, Evason spent the next several seasons working in the Predators organization as the head coach of their AHL affiliate, the Milwaukee Admirals. There, he helped guide more than a few future NHL stalwarts — namely Mattias Ekholm, Ryan Ellis, Filip Forsberg, Calle Järnkrok, Viktor Arvidsson, and Kevin Fiala, among many others. After joining the Wild, he earned a promotion to head coach within two seasons when the Wild fired Bruce Boudreau late in the 2019-20 campaign.

Just a couple of years later, Evason had coached the Wild to their best season in franchise history. The 2021-22 campaign saw the Wild break the 50-win mark for the first time since their inception in 2000, nearly sitting atop the Central Division with 113 points. That was in an extremely tough group with the 119-point Stanley Cup champion Avalanche and the 109-point Blues, whom the Wild bowed out to in the first round of the playoffs. The Wild remain without a playoff series victory since the 2015 postseason and have not advanced to a Conference Final since the 2002-03 season.

So with the Wild now far out of the playoff picture with a 5-10-4 record, sitting bottom five in the league in both goals for and against, a change was necessary and expected. Injuries and goaltending have certainly played a factor in their poor play — captain Jared Spurgeon missed the first 13 games of the season, and Filip Gustavsson’s and Marc-André Fleury’s combined .878 SV% is near the bottom of the league.

They’ve likely been unlucky, too. The Wild have controlled a slim majority of scoring chances and a strong majority of high-danger chances during 5-on-5 play, a common theme for an organization that’s usually one of the more defensively stout in the league. But the culture around the team is evidently turning sour quickly, Kirill Kaprizov is on pace for a career-low 26 goals and has a team-worst -10 rating, and most of their depth defensemen have been significant liabilities. This roster is not all that different from the one that’s finished top-three in the Central Division for three straight seasons, and it’s certainly one that still has playoff aspirations.

Minnesota has not won since Nov. 7 against the Islanders and is winless in seven straight.

Woods, who had worked on the Capitals’ bench with Evason briefly as an assistant in the early 2010s, is now on the open market after more than six seasons with the Wild. It’s unclear whether the Wild will opt to fill his vacancy.

Hynes, who was let go by the Predators after last season, is technically in the final season of his contract with Nashville. That means the Predators had to grant permission to their divisional rival to speak to their former head coach and that Hynes will be paid by both Minnesota and Nashville this season.

Now behind the bench of his third NHL franchise, he faces an uphill climb to get Minnesota back in the playoff picture. Hynes will suit up behind an NHL bench for a ninth consecutive season, as he was fired by the Devils and hired by Nashville midway through the 2019-20 campaign.

The Wild will certainly get a boost in the standings once Fleury and Gustavsson improve their play between the pipes, a likely scenario given their stellar performance last season. However, they again have the misfortune of being in quite a competitive division. The Avalanche and Stars occupy first and second place as expected powerhouses, while the Blues, Predators and Coyotes all sit at or above the .500 mark and, especially in Nashville’s case, have posted decent underlying numbers.

Hynes’ main job is simply to restore confidence in his group. This roster has the ability to play better — especially Kaprizov, who, despite the okay point production, has looked like a complete non-factor on some nights. The team also hopes a significant change behind the bench can boost their league-worst penalty kill, which is operating at just 66.7%. Penalty killing was an area of strength for Nashville last season, who finished tied for fourth in the NHL with an 82.6% success rate.

The Wild will be on the hook for the remainder of Evason’s contract, which runs through 2024-25 at just under $2M per season.","Wild fire HC Dean Evason, hire John Hynes as replacement",https://www.yardbarker.com/nhl/articles/wild_fire_hc_dean_evason_hire_john_hynes_as_replacement/s1_14825_39593137,Yardbarker
sports,Tom Naghten,2023-11-30T23:19:12+00:00,"Australian super lightweight contender Liam Paro says he’s got no time for “schoolyard bullsh*t” after being inadvertently caught in the middle of some classic boxing social media drama.

A video of Paro sparring WBC lightweight champion Shakur Stevenson was circulated last week after the American sent it to Bill Haney, the father of former undisputed 135-pound champ, Devin.

The vision popped up while Stevenson was under-fire for his cautious performance in defeating Edwin De Los Santos, a fight which broke the record for the fewest punches landed over a 12-round contest.

MORE: What Devin Haney's decision to vacate lightweight titles means for Gervonta Davis, Shakur Stevenson, Lomachenko, Kambosos and more

In the short clip, Stevenson gets the better of Paro and is much more active and aggressive than he was against De Los Santos.

“That’s a video from 2019. It makes him look stupid, I believe,” Paro told Sporting News.

“Someone in his camp has obviously leaked something out and it shows that it's obviously gotten to him.

“But a 45-second clip of 240 minutes - we’ve sparred over 80 rounds - if that's your best thing, well, fair enough, so be it, if that helps you sleep at night, good on you.

“It’s nothing for me, I'll take the free exposure from the little bitchiness going on, but I’ve just got my mind set on the job.

“I'll just let my actions speak for me. I think it's just stress you don't need to put on yourself and get involved in.

“Boxing is a very mentally stressful sport as it is. So when I'm not boxing and fighting, I like to kick back and stick to myself.”

Paro, who, along with Stevenson, has sparred with the likes of Devin Haney and Rolly Romero over the course of several camps in Las Vegas, said he’d still work with him again if required.

“We've always had nothing but respect for him and his camp,” he added.

“I don't get involved in the sh*t. I think it's a bit of schoolyard bullsh*t.

“I'm just going to get rounds in if we need him or if we fight another southpaw and that opportunity’s there, of course, it’d be a no brainer.

“He's probably one of the best, if not the best, southpaw around.

“If it's going to benefit me and my career, of course I'll get the work in.”

Paro’s is a career which has, unfortunately, stalled in 2023.

After scoring a first-round knockout over Brock Jarvis last October, the Queenslander looked set for a big year.

He was lined up to face Robbie Davies Jnr in a headline slot in Liverpool in March before a routine CT scan picked up an unknown facial fracture, seeing the presiding commission rule him out.

After that disappointment, the 27-year-old secured a long-awaited world title shot, against Regis Pregrais in New Orleans in June.

This time it was an Achilles tendon issue which forced him to withdraw, sidelining him for an extended period and temporarily seeing him relocate to his hometown of Mackay.

“Absolutely heartbreaking. There's no other words for it,” he said of the missed world title shot.

“I was so devastated. At one stage, it felt like everything was coming to an end.

“I've had a pretty smooth career until this year and two injuries, back-to-back, it definitely tested me mentally.

“I went through hell and back. I was lucky I was around the right people, I was supported by my loved ones up home.

“It tested me, it's seen how much I really did love the sport and how dedicated I was to it.

“It was just a full reset. It relit the fire in my belly.

“It's just good to be back and I definitely want to leave all that in the past and keep steamrolling forward.”

Now back fit again, Paro faces Ohio’s Montana Love in San Francisco on December 9 (Dec. 10 in Australia) on the undercard to the WBC super lightweight title bout between Haney and Prograis.

WATCH: Paro vs. Love, live on DAZN

Aussie fans will recognise Love as the man who lost via disqualification when he threw Stevie Spark out of the ring in frustration last October.

Paro hopes to put a difficult run behind him and kick off a world title charge with an emphatic win on a big card.

“I’ll just bring the fight to [Love], he likes a slow, controlled fight, a slow pace,” Paro said of the challenge which awaits in his return.

“We've seen with the [Spark] fight, a bit of pressure and he folds, so bring the fight to him.

“He's obviously weak in the head a little bit and actions speak louder than words, you've seen that in his fight.

“So we're going to bring the fight to him. Smart pressure, smart boxing.

“I honestly believe I'm better than him in every aspect, except wrestling.”

After previously being ranked number one in the division with the WBO, Paro is now 11th in line for a shot at the championship - a casualty of his inactivity.

“The Prodigy” is confident one good performance can put him right back at the front of the queue.

“I'm going to get my title shot,” he said

“I've proved it time and time again that I belong at the top level and I intend to do that on December 9, too, and stamp my way into a world title into an opposite corner and win it when I get my shot.

“2024, I want a busy year. I want to fight three times next year.

“I've only had one round in two years. I missed the sport and it's lit a new fire in my belly.”

The pair have been feuding on X and things escalated on Wednesday when the Aussie brought up Becker’s bankruptcy-related charges. Becker spent eight months in prison last year.

Their social media spat started when Kyrgios used Becker, a six-time Grand Slam title winner, as an example when claiming that older tennis players were poor pundits on modern tennis because the game has eveolved so much.

Becker has said Kyrgios would not be making a living from the game had it not been for the trail blazed by the stars of his generation.

“Uhhh what? I’ve been arguably one of the most watched players outside the big three the last decade? Fans around the world and have brought so many more people to the sport. I’ve created my own stuff off the court,” Kyrgios wrote on X, adding: “Try to not hide any more assets x”.

Becker was found guilty of four charges under the Insolvency Act, having been accused of hiding assets in relation to his bankruptcy.

Kyrgios also reposted other quotes from Becker’s interview and shared another post, claiming he was the one bringing in more money for his fellow players.

He wrote: “Bro what. I’ve been one of the FEW PLAYERS that have brought million more fans to the sport and have made more money for everyone. NETFLIX…. Don’t remember seeing Boris on there. Guy is ridiculous. I’ve made my career off the court without the help of the others.”

Not once have I taken ‘slams’ away from Becker, or any of these legends. Not once have I said I’ve impacted the game MORE. I’ve simply said that I’ve built my own brand and done it my way & brought fans. Apparently a slam finalist has no credibility. Night, done with this convo. — Nicholas Kyrgios (@NickKyrgios) December 19, 2023

Becker told Eurosport: “We live in a democracy. Everyone can think what he wants. You have to have respect for the past and simply say ‘thank you’ out loud that these old pros existed, because without them the tennis circus would no longer exist.

“I did play a bit in the 80s, but there was [Stefan] Edberg, [Mats] Wilander. The 90s were [Andre] Agassi, [Pete] Sampras. All these players make it possible for Nick Kyrgios not to play tennis at all this year and still be able to make a living from tennis.”

Kyrgios sparked the beef when he claimed current players are superior to those of the 70s and 80s.

“The game was so slow back then. I’ve watched Boris Becker and I’m not saying they weren’t good in their time, but to say that they would be just as good now, it’s absurd,” he told The Athletic.

Djokovic change that made him shine

Former French star Jo-Wilfried Tsonga says Novak Djokovic started out trying too hard to be like Roger Federer and Rafa Nadal, but sent his career into overdrive when he embraced his true nature.

The former world No.5 told the Generation Do It Yourself podcast that Djokovic longed to be like his great rivals.

“I consider that he had a period where he didn’t want to be himself. He wanted to be Roger Federer or Rafael Nadal, when perhaps he should have remained himself all along,” Tsonga said.

“I think today he is himself. And even if it is divisive, I think that’s why it is appreciated by many people. Because now he’s completely honest.

“He wanted to get away from this warrior image that he has, because he is a Serb, who experienced difficult things in his childhood. So he’s a warrior, he should have assumed it from the start. I think he would have been loved for that.”

Djokovic recently spoke about the relationship he has with Federer and Nadal.

“Obviously we haven’t gotten along very well during our careers off the field,” he told 60 Minutes..

“We’re not friends because we’re rivals and it’s difficult to be close as opponents. Some things you share about your life or how you feel can be used against you.

“We have shared the stage for many years and I think there has always been the utmost respect, at least on my part, towards them. I hope that one day we will be closer, to be able to sit and talk and reflect. It would be truly incredible.”

Hewitt at the helm

Australia’s David Cup captain Lleyton Hewitt will return to captain the Aussie team at the United Cup.

Eighteen nations will contest the tournament in Perth and Sydney starting December 29 and ending on January 7.

The tournament began last year with Hewitt and Sam Stosur at the helm.

David Witt, who helped lead the United States to the 2023 trophy, also returns in 2024 for the Americans’ title defence.

Can Djokovic go the distance?

Former Spanish star Alex Corretja has questioned Novak Djokovic durability ahead of a Golden Slam attempt in 2024.

The Paris Olympics adds an extra high profile tournament to the four majors next year.

It appears a big leap for Djokovic to win all five – considering he’s yet to claim a Grand Slam of all four – pulling up just short three times.

While there are doubts over the fitness of Rafa Nadal – set to return in Brisbane ahead of the Australian Open – a hungry pack of new talent will be waiting for a slip up.

“I think that would be a little bit surprising [to win a Golden Slam],” Corretja said.

“Because even if he improves his game so much, he’s getting older. It’s normal that he is getting older and the recovery is not the same.

“I’m sure that he’s going to keep on winning Slams, but it’s going to be tougher and tougher and he knows that.”

While Djokovic ended 2023 as world No.1 for an eighth time, faced several defeats by the younger rivals including Lorenzo Musetti (at the Monte-Carlo Masters), Holger Rune (at the Rome Masters), Carlos Alcaraz (in the Wimbledon final) and Jannik Sinner (in the ATP Finals group stage and the Davis Cup).

“In a way, I feel the match that he lost against [Jannik Sinner] in the Davis Cup might be good for him. It’s a wake-up call to say, ‘Okay, I’m doing unbelievably, but I can’t relax for one second because some of the guys behind me are going to push me so much. They’re very dangerous and they know they can beat me now,’” Corretja said.

Pliskova bemoans loss of charisma

Karolina Pliskova fears the women’s tour has suffered a loss of charisma with the retirements of Serena Williams and Maria Sharapova.

Pliskova, a former world No 1, believes there was a bigger interest in the women’s game earlier in her career.

“I guess not only I feel that it’s not entirely ideal, even though each of today’s top girls has something to offer,” Pliskova told iSport.

“I won’t comment on the tennis aspect, but charisma plays a role too. Sharapova and Serena were huge personalities, even in the marketing world. You can’t compare today’s girls with them. And I think that in this situation, the WTA isn’t helping much either.

“It doesn’t seem to me that they promote it well. Women’s tennis now seems sidelined. Not as many people go to it as before. When I was playing well and these big names were still active, the level of everything around the game was higher.”

Murray joins young gun for Brisbane

Andy Murray has added another event to his Australian Open warm-up schedule and it should prove a treat for Brisbane fans.

The former world No 1 had already entered the singles draw at the Brisbane International but he’s added the doubles with 20-year-old Holger Rune – giving the pair a 16-year age gap.

Rune is coached by Boris Becker and world ranked No.8.

Murray is trying to restart his momentum after a disappointing 2023 where he slipped to world No.42.

It will be the first time that Murray and Rune play together.","Tennis News: Kyrgios escalates beef with Becker, change ‘warrior’ Novak had to make, WTA criticised for charisma fail",https://www.theroar.com.au/2023/12/20/tennis-news-kyrgios-escalates-beef-with-becker-change-warrior-novak-had-to-make-wta-criticised-for-charisma-fail/,The Roar | Sports Writers Blog

This week we have all 32 teams playing, which means a tougher challenge than in recent weeks.

Even so, I like the card. It is Thanksgiving Week, and I have a lot to be thankful for, but next week you will be thanking me.

Here's to an 11-5 week ATS and 12-4 week straight up.

Thursday, 12:30 p.m. ET (Fox, fubo)

This is a big game in the division for both teams, a survival test for Green Bay and a big one for the Lions if they want to try and get home-field advantage in the conference. The Lions have had defensive issues as of late and Jordan Love has played well the past two weeks. That will keep the Packers in this game, but the Lions win it.

Pick: Lions 31, Packers 27 (Result: Packers 29, Lions 22)

Thursday, 4:30 p.m. ET (CBS, Paramount+)

The Commanders are coming off a dud last week against the Giants, while Dallas is flying high. The Cowboys are playing as well as any team in the league. Washington's offensive line is an issue, which will lead to the Cowboys having a field day with their defensive front. Dak Prescott plays well again. Cowboys roll.

Pick: Cowboys 32, Commanders 16 (Result: Cowboys 45-10)

Thursday, 8:20 p.m. ET (NBC, fubo)

This is a huge division game for two teams that have had a good rivalry over the past decade. The Seahawks are coming off a bad loss to the Rams, while the 49ers are coming off two dominant victories. Geno Smith is banged up, so his health is key. The 49ers have the look of a Super team again. They show it here.

Pick: 49ers 28, Seahawks 19 (Result: 49ers 31-13)

Friday, 3 p.m. ET (Amazon Prime Video)

This Friday game the day after Thanksgiving isn't what it was expected to be with the Jets being an offensive disaster. The Jets defense is coming off a bad showing against Buffalo, and will be challenged here by the Dolphins. Tim Boyle will start at quarterback for the Jets, but will it matter? Even so, I think the Jets keep it close with their defense.

Pick: Dolphins 21, Jets 16 (Result: Dolphins 34-13)

Sunday, 1 p.m. ET (Fox, fubo)

This is a big game in a division with one team with a .500 record, that being the Saints. Both teams are coming off a bye, but the Saints have some injury issues. The quarterback situation isn't great for the Falcons, which is why I think the Saints will win it behind their defense.

Pick: Saints 24, Falcons 20

Sunday, 1 p.m. ET (CBS, Paramount+)

The Bengals without Joe Burrow will be a different team. Jake Browning starts, but we have no real idea what he can do. The Steelers defense is good. We know that. The Steelers fired offensive coordinator Matt Canada this week to hopefully liven up the offense. Kenny Pickett needs to play better now. He will here as the Steelers take it.

Pick: Steelers 23, Bengals 21

Sunday, 1 p.m. ET (CBS, Paramount+)

This is for first place in the division, with the Texans owning the Jaguars in recent years, winning 10 of 11 and blowing them out earlier this year. But the Jaguars got back on track last week and Trevor Lawrence played well. That will continue here as the Jaguars take command of the division.

Pick: Jaguars 27, Texans 23

The Bucs are playing a second straight road game, while the Colts are coming off a bye. That's a big edge for the Colts. Even so, I think the Bucs have the better team and Baker Mayfield will play well in this one. Gardner Minshew will not. Bucs win it, although they are banged up some on defense.

Pick: Bucs 30, Colts 21

New England Patriots (-3) at New York Giants

Sunday, 1 p.m. ET (Fox, fubo)

These are two of the bottom teams in the league, both with quarterback issues. Tommy DeVito did play well for the Giants last week, but Bill Belichick has had great success against rookie quarterbacks. The Patriots quarterback situation isn't good either, but I think the Patriots will find a way to win this one.

Pick: Patriots 21, Giants 17

Sunday, 1 p.m. ET (Fox, fubo)

This is the dog game of the week, featuring two rookie passers who are struggling behind bad lines. Bryce Young and Will Levis have been brutalized at times. What's to think that will change here? The Titans defense is better, so they get the best of it in what should be an ugly game.

Pick: Titans 23, Panthers 12

Los Angeles Rams at Arizona Cardinals (PK)

Sunday, 4:05 p.m. ET (Fox, fubo)

The Rams are coming off a comeback victory over the Seahawks, while the Cardinals lost a tough one to the Texans last week. Kyler Murray has played well in his two starts, which I think will continue here. The Cardinals will slow down Matt Stafford and gang to win it.

Sunday, 4:05 p.m. ET (Fox, fubo)

This is suddenly a big game for both teams. The Broncos have won four straight, while the Browns are 7-3 and would be in the playoffs right now. This will be the first road start for Browns rookie quarterback Dorian Thompson-Robinson, which won't be easy. But the Cleveland defense is dominant. They will shut down the Denver offense in a low-scoring game to win it.

Pick: Browns 20, Broncos 12

The Chiefs are coming off a tough Monday night loss and now must travel on a short week. The Raiders have looked so much better the past three games, but this is a tough test against a wounded Super Bowl champ. The Chiefs get back on track here.

Pick: Chiefs 27, Raiders 17

Sunday, 4:25 p.m. ET (CBS, Paramount+)

The Eagles are playing on a short week after a road victory over the Chiefs on Monday night. The Bills are coming off an impressive victory over the Jets. Josh Allen looked good in that game, and he will in this one. He keeps it close, but the Eagles find a way late.

Pick: Eagles 31, Bills 30

Sunday, 8:20 p.m. ET (NBC, fubo)

The Chargers are having major issues right now and face one of the best teams in the league in this one. The Ravens offense will miss tight end Mark Andrews, but the Chargers defense is perfect for any team throwing the football. The Ravens will win it with a big game from Lamar Jackson.

Pick: Ravens 30, Chargers 23

Monday, 8:15 p.m. ET (ABC/ESPN, fubo)

These two are coming off tough losses, with the Bears blowing a huge lead late. It was more damning for the Vikings, a team that had been surging. Minnesota's defense will be the difference here as they get the best of Justin Fields. Vikings take it.

Reality TV star Rachel Lindsay, a longtime NFL fan, recently slammed the “obnoxious” coverage, highlighting the “exhausting” uptick in Swifties obsessing over football. But that’s just one example of how fans are finding this fixation a little too disrespectful towards the sport.

From the league’s humble beginnings in 1920 to the $18 billion juggernaut that it is today, the ride has been rocky with more than just a few small bumps along the road. But with the ambitious target that NFL Commissioner, Roger Goodell, has set for 2027, is there a new strategy in the 104-year-old league’s master plan to dominate the world sporting scene?

Why the ‘Traylor’ saga will be the key to Roger Goodell’s $27 billion target?

How can you not love Taylor Swift? Most of the 12 Grammy Awardee’s songs are about that warm fuzzy feeling and chemical reaction that we call love. And her songs have earned the support of 103.7992 million Swifties in the world. Yeah, we don’t have a round figure for that. We have the exact figure up to four decimals. That’s how much data we have on her. Football has 184 million fans. The league is able to generate a revenue of $18 billion from 184 million. If it adds 104 (after rounding 103.7992) million to that number, guess how much revenue it will generate? $28 billion. And just like that, their target will be met.

And while analysts like Stephen A. Smith may go around telling people they should be embarrassed of themselves for getting so invested in someone else’s relationship, it is good business for the NFL. TMZ reported that #87’s jersey sales skyrocketed 400% and his Instagram followers by 276%. Yahoo Finance reported a 53% rise in viewership among teen girls. Who would have thought in their wildest dreams that the NFL would manage to rope in this part of the population? The October 1 matchup between the Chiefs and the Jets drew 27 million viewers. And became the most-watched Sunday TV show since the last Super Bowl! And the last Super Bowl had an actual concert by Rihanna.

Kaepernick, who? Deflategate, what? In the media frenzy surrounding the two lovebirds, other issues get thrown out of the window. How can fans forget that the NFL is also organizing games outside the American borders with a view to garnering international appeal? The NFL has scheduled 5 games abroad this season. It is also addressing the concussion controversies. It recently added both new concussion rules and a new $100 million initiative called “Play Smart, Play Safe,” to make the sport safer for players. And all the effort is showing.

According to Joe Pompliano, “The NFL will bring in $20 billion in revenue this year, more than the Premier League, La Liga, Bundesliga, Serie A, and Ligue 1 combined.” Coming to the strategy part, a curious mind would perhaps think can they take a leaf out of the NBA’s playbook and reinvigorate its appeal as it aims to conquer international audiences?

Can the NFL take a leaf out of the NBA’s grisly past and glorious recovery?

The NFL is already the world’s richest league. Calling it an incredible feat would be a gross understatement. Consider this: the English Premier League, which is broadcast in over 212 territories, has a revenue of just $6 billion, while football games are primarily viewed in America only. However, the NFL does not just want to stop at $18 billion. It wants to become a $27 billion league in 4 years. But it must address a few skeletons in its closet before reaching that goal.

If you were around in the 1970s (that would make you at least 50 years old today), you would know that the NBA did not have the mass appeal that it enjoys now. With average game attendance hovering around 8,000 a game, it was one of the darkest periods of the basketball league. Drug abuse, brawls on the hardwood court that sometimes spilled over onto coaches and players – it wasn’t a pretty sight. As reported in the Washington Post, even though there are no reliable figures on cocaine use by players, “estimates by people in the game range from 40 percent to 75 percent.” Revisiting the NBA caricature back in time, the New York Knicks became the first all-Black team in 1979. But their fans made their disapproval very apparent. “It wasn’t so much New York attitudes, but fans around the league let you know how they felt about you as an opponent and as a Black man as well,” Knicks star Earl Monroe told Newsday.

We could list out all the scandals, fights, and controversies here, but you get the idea. Billionaire entrepreneur Mark Cuban, who paid $1.8 million (approx.) in penalties on behalf of his team, the Dallas Mavericks, fondly remembered the former NBA commissioner David Stern, on his death in January 2020. Stern came and instituted an anti-drug agreement and even banned All-Star player Michal Richardson for life for drug abuse. The revitalized image of the NBA helped rake in the moolah from sponsors and made it more appealing to fans. He even went against the tide to open up the Olympic basketball competition to NBA players resulting in the famous “Dream Team” of 1992. America has never failed to win a medal in the 19 Olympic basketball games that it has played since then.

The NFL has had its fair share of, um, let’s say, “bumps” down the road as well. From Colin Kaepernick taking a knee during the national anthem to protest against racism, to domestic violence by players, to the Deflategate and Bountygate scandals. But there have been bigger crises as well. The Union of Concerned Scientists accused the NFL of trying to intimidate scientists studying the link between CTE and pro football. The NFL is already way past other leagues in terms of revenue, and now with the pivotal shift in its strategy, “America’s favorite pastime” is on its way to world domination.

sports,Shaikh Aerajuddin,2023-11-21T21:21:15+00:00,"One of the most talked about in the pro wrestling fandom is CM Punk’s next move following his exit from AEW. The Second City Saint was released from the Jacksonville-based promotion back in September 2023 due to his backstage altercation with Jack Perry at AEW All In 2023. Following this, there have been multiple speculations about what might be the former WWE star’s next move. While he has been dropping multiple hints sparking rumors, fans are particularly inclined that he might return to his old stomping ground, WWE.

America’s Favorite Video Today

The speculations stem from the fact that the latest Premium Live Event Survivor Series will be held in his hometown, Chicago, Illinois. While the possibility of his return exists, there are a few WWE stars that he might lock horns with following his return at the Survivor Series.

Shinsuke Nakamura

ADVERTISEMENT Article continues below this ad

The recent cryptic promos by the King of Strong Style have left the fans scratching their heads. The promos which started several weeks ago, show Nakamura calling out to someone that he wants to have a duel with. The mystery opponent has not been revealed yet and according to reports, talents at WWE are pretty clueless as well. However, fans were pretty fast to decode who might be his opponent. At the fallout episode of Raw following Fastlane, Nakamura was particularly frustrated due to his loss against Seth Rollins.

As Ricochet was on his way walking down the ramp, Nakamura attacked him with CM Punk’s finisher Go To Sleep. There has been a lot of controversy surrounding this move, but it was popularly used by the former WWE star to secure his wins. It was after this that Nakamura’s cryptic promos started airing. Fans might get to see a confrontation between him and Punk if he returns at the Survivor Series. As Nakamura is known to be quite persistent, a long rivalry between the two might be the center of Punk’s return arc.

Seth Rollins

While this might come as an obvious piece of information considering Rollins has the WWE World Heavyweight Championship title, the reason behind it might be from outside the ring. When CM Punk made his return to WWE Backstage in 2019, many saw this as the precursor to his return to the company, including Rollins, who invited him to step into the ring with the Messiah.

Fast forward to January 2023 in an interview during the promotion of the WWE 2k23, The Visionary made his feelings for CM Punk after his backstage antics in AEW. Rollins referred to him as a “cancer” also stating that he should stay away from him and WWE. The following week when he made those comments, the current WWE World Heavyweight Champion decided to shed some light on his intentions.

Referring to him as ‘Chicago Phil’, he said that he is as selfish as another WWE talent, Logan Paul. He even added that Punk has particularly helped him during his career but the former WWE star has taken a lot from the promotion as well. He believes that he might not be in the right headspace but he has to contribute somehow. Rollins even added that if he is not going to provide for the industry he does not deserve to be a part of it.

These comments by Rollins will be the setting stone for their rivalry. If CM Punk returns to WWE at Survivor Series, fans might get to see a minor confrontation or possibly a verbal confrontation between the two given the very real animosity between the two. It will also be a neat wrinkle in their character arc considering CM Punk brought forth the S.H.I.E.L.D. which is the faction that brought Rollins to prominence.

Cody Rhodes

CM Punk and Cody Rhodes do have a lot of history. Both the stars were a part of All Elite Wrestling. Even though they were in the same promotion, the two never got a chance to spar. But Rhodes and Punk had a bout in WWE a while back during their initial days. The two had brawled on a couple of occasions. One was during a tag team match with his tag-team partner Ted Debiase Jr. The then World Tag Team Champions lost their title to CM Punk and his partner Kofi Kingston. Apart from that, the two had tussled in front of the 2008 Intercontinental Champion, William Regal.

The altercation ended and The American Nightmare came out as the winner of the fight. It’s been more than a decade since that fight and fans will notice that Rhodes has grown leaps and bounds. In one of his last promos in AEW before departing for WWE, Rhodes says Punk laid the roadmap for a wrestling revolution. “He listed things that for me, were taboo at the time, like going to New Japan, working for Ring of Honor, he talked about teaming with the Young Bucks.”

He then goes on to say it wasn’t Punk who executed the revolution it was him. He says, “He was unable to do those things…In his absence, in the void that CM Punk left behind, somebody did do each and every one of those things, I did them! I held every grain of that revolution in my hands and you cheered!” From these words, it seems clear that Rhodes harbors a degree of bitterness toward Punk’s fan welfare as he feels Punk just spoke of a wrestling revolution whereas he was the one to actually execute it. If Punk were to follow Rhodes to WWE and steal his thunder as he did in AEW, it’s unlikely the American Nightmare would take too kindly to it. With both being masters on the mic, this has the makings of all-time classic rivalry, one fans have been clamoring for while the two were signed to AEW.

sports,Reuters,2023-09-30T21:17:47+00:00,"Bayern Munich struck twice in the second half to come from two goals down and snatch a 2-2 draw at RB Leipzig but the champions dropped to third in the Bundesliga with their second draw of the season.

Goals from Leroy Sané and Harry Kane cancelled out Leipzig’s first-half lead but the result left Bayern on 14 points, two behind the leaders, Bayer Leverkusen. Leipzig, who host Manchester City in the Champions League next week, are fifth, a further point behind.

“Two very different halves from our perspective,” the Bayern coach, Thomas Tuchel, said. “In the first we started well but only for the first two minutes and missed that huge chance.

“We were too slow, made too many mistakes and were not courageous enough. After the break we showed a different mentality. It was a bit wild, with a lot of risk but it is a positive result, not to lose after being 2-0 down. We showed character.” Bayern travel to Copenhagen in the Champions League next week.

Leipzig struck twice in six minutes with Loïs Openda putting them in front in the 20th when he completed a quick break. They scored again with Castello Lukeba stabbing in after the goalkeeper Sven Ulreich misjudged a corner.

Bayern earned a 57th-minute penalty against the run of play for a handball and Kane cut the deficit with his eighth league goal. Only Manchester City’s Erling Haaland, when he played for Borussia Dortmund, scored more often in his first six Bundesliga games with nine goals.

The Bavarians’ comeback was complete in the 70th with Kane clearing the ball in his own half and Musiala finding Sané for the equaliser.

In Spain Real Madrid outclassed Girona 3-0 to return to the top of LaLiga, thanks to goals from Joselu, Aurélien Tchouaméni and Jude Bellingham.

Real moved on to 21 points from eight games, one ahead of Barcelona, who beat Sevilla 1-0 at home on Friday. Girona dropped to third.

“I feel very good. I have freedom of movement and I’m enjoying football. Whenever I put on this shirt I always try to do my best,” said Bellingham.

Real will also be buoyed up by the performance of Vinícius Jr, who looked lively in his first start since returning from a thigh muscle injury, before being taken off in the 68th minute. Real’s coach, Carlo Ancelotti, said: “It was a solid, convincing game. We defended well, we knew they could cause damage with the ball, they are a team that plays good football, it was important to defend well and we did that.”

Lautaro Martínez came off the bench to score all four goals for Internazionale as they won 4-0 at Salernitana tto return to the top of Serie A.

The hosts kept Inter at bay for an hour but Martínez came on nine minutes after the break to bag four goals in 27 minutes.

“I scored four goals but the important thing is that Inter won,” the striker, who has scored nine goals in seven league games and is Serie A’s top scorer, told Sky Sport Italia. “It was crucial. We lost a game at San Siro [to Sassuolo] that I don’t think we deserved but we conceded two goals from our errors, so we had to win today.”

While Inter dominated the early stages, Salernitana found their footing and managed to control the tempo in a goalless first half. But Martínez opened the scoring in the 62nd minute when he collected Marcus Thuram’s low cross and chipped a finish over Guillermo Ochoa.

Three minutes later Mateusz Legowski’s apparent equaliser was disallowed due to an offside. Martínez then got his second goal after 77 minutes when he confidently finished a pass from Nicolò Barella with a first-time strike.

Martínez completed his hat-trick from the penalty spot with five minutes remaining after Matteo Lovato pulled Thuram’s shirt. He concluded the evening by converting Carlos Augusto’s cross from 10 yards out.

Inter lead Serie A with 18 points, the same as their neighbours, Milan, who had briefly topped the table earlier in the day after beating Lazio 2-0 thanks to second-half goals from Christian Pulisic and Noah Okafor. Rafael Leão played a vital role in both goals, with the 24-year-old Portugal international providing two assists in a menacing display.

“After the break, we were more compact and certainly more energetic, hungrier and more determined,” Milan’s coach, Stefano Pioli, told DAZN. “That is a great sign when playing every three days and it was a fully deserved victory.”

Milan suffered a potential injury blow as the midfielder Ruben Loftus-Cheek limped off in the first half. “It would be a shame if we lost Ruben, he felt a twinge near the groin area,” Pioli said. “Unfortunately, injuries tend to come when players are in good shape.”

In France, AS Monaco beat Marseille 3-2 to move top of Ligue 1, thanks to a brace from the midfielder Maghnes Akliouche and a powerful strike from Folarin Balogun.

Marseille, who appointed Gennaro Gattuso as coach this week, took the lead after 30 secondsthrough Iliman Ndiaye’s goal, only for the hosts to respond minutes later when Akliouche fired a low shot past Pau López.

The visitors regained the lead in the 18th minute when Ndiaye centred for Samuel Gigot to send a left-footed shot past Philipp Köhn, but Monaco equalised five minutes later as Akliouche found Balogun who scored with a fierce finish.

sports,Bill Bender,2023-11-11T21:32:44+00:00,"Did Michigan really need Jim Harbaugh on Saturday?

Perhaps the result provides the short-term answer. No. 3 Michigan beat No. 10 Penn State 24-15 at Beaver Stadium on Saturday. The Wolverines threw one pass in the second half – and that didn't even technically count – in a risk-averse game plan under acting coach Sherrone Moore. The defense smothered the Nittany Lions, and that will lead to more buildup ahead of the showdown with No. 1 Ohio State on Nov. 25.

Then Moore let it all there in the Fox postgame interview with Jenny Taft. Even if the answer is no, Harbaugh was ever-present.

""I want to thank the Lord and I want to thank Coach Harbaugh,"" Moore said. ""I f------ love you man. I love the s--- out of you, man. I did this for you, for this university, the president, our AD. We've got the best players, best university, and the best alumni in the country. I love these guys. These f------ guys right here. These guys right here. These guys did it.""

MORE: Sherrone Moore gives tearful interview after Penn State win

Whoa, let's add the FCC standards to the Wolverines' list of potential violations. If Michigan (10-0, 7-0 Big Ten) was not the college football heel heading into the final two weeks of the regular season, then they are public enemy No. 1 now. It might be “Michigan vs. Everybody,” and everybody has the same question.

Will Harbaugh be on the field before the end of the regular season? The Big Ten made a Friday ruling that will prohibit Harbaugh from being on the field for the final three regular-season games as a result of the in-person scouting and sign-stealing scandal that led to the resignation of staffer Conor Stallions. ESPN reported there will be a temporary restraining order hearing on Nov. 17 that will answer that question.

On the field, Michigan answered the question about its College Football Playoff. Sort of. The Wolverines proved they could beat Penn State (8-2, 5-2) in a 20-yard box. Neither team completed a pass of 20 yards or more. Michigan trailed 3-0 after the first quarter. The Wolverines had eight carries for 10 yards, and Penn State's Abdul Carter set the tone with a jarring hit on Blake Corum that nearly resulted in a fumble.

Michigan took control with the running game. Donovan Edwards ripped off a 22-yard run, and Corum added a 44-yard run to set up a 3-yard TD run. Edwards added a 22-yard TD run on the next drive. The same “Lightning and Lightning” tandem that burned the Nittany Lions last year staked Michigan to a 14-9 halftime lead.

MORE: Michigan got off easy with Harbaugh suspension

Then, the Wolverines took the ball out of quarterback J.J. McCarthy's hand. The Wolverines had 30 rushing attempts and zero passing attempts save a pass to tight end Colston Loveland that drew a pass interference call. McCarthy finished 7 of 8 passing for 60 yards in what has to be the most conservative play-calling victory in a top-10 showdown in recent memory. Was this old-school Big Ten football or Big Ten West football in disguise?

Michigan's defense clamped on Penn State quarterback Drew Allar (10 of 22, 70 yards, TD), and the Nittany Lions had one play of more than 20 yards. Corum closed the drama with a 30-yard TD.

The same-old questions about Nittany Lions coach James Franklin in big games resurfaced, but those are back-page headlines in the Big Ten East race. The quirky tiebreaker involving Big Ten West opponents? That's out the door. The winner-take-all showdown between Ohio State and Michigan? There are a full two weeks of anticipation for that now.

Harbaugh reportedly watched the game from the team hotel, and now the leading piece of drama returns. Moore's postgame emotion was a headline, but there is a reality that set in through a brutal watch of a second half.

McCarthy is a leader. Corum (26–145, 2 TDs) and Edwards (10-52, TD) can grind on anybody. The defense now has allowed just 7.5 points per game.

But the Wolverines will not be able to beat Ohio State the same way they beat Penn State. That 20-yard box will stretch across the entire country, and it requires a coach ready to make those legacy-defining decisions. The Buckeyes have Heisman Trophy candidate Marvin Harrison Jr., and he was the separator when Ohio State beat Penn State 20-12 on Oct. 21. The Buckeyes have a top-five defense, too, and all of the back-and-forth rage between those rivals will reach a 1970s pitch – 1973 for those who know – as they barrel toward another 11-0 vs. 11-0 showdown at the Big House.

Who is the good guy? Who is the villain? Ohio State and Michigan locked in their answers a long time ago. More than 17 million people watched last year's matchup – a 45-23 Michigan victory where Stalions' involvement continues to be scrutinized through a double-barrel Big Ten and NCAA investigation. Big Ten commissioner Tony Petitti's ruling sent a shockwave through the conference Friday, mainly because the third game means Harbaugh will not be on the sideline for The Game. Early forecasts say 20 million will tune in for The Game this year.

Will Harbaugh really not be there? That is for the courts to decide, but Moore’s comments suggest Harbaugh, president Santa Ono and athletic director Warde Manuel are on a united front; consequences be damned in 2024 and beyond.

In the short term? The College Football Playoff committee could slide Michigan up to No. 2 now, and the debate with the Buckeyes and No. 1 Georgia is going to perk up more than ever. They are the three best teams in the country, but only one has uncertainty with the head coach.

Whether they admit it or not, Michigan still needs Harbaugh for those moments, especially in two weeks.

The reality is he might not be present for that one either.","Michigan didn't need Jim Harbaugh against Penn State, but Ohio State is a different game",https://www.sportingnews.com/us/ncaa-football/news/michigan-jim-harbaugh-penn-state-ohio-state-different-game/91a7f796bb8ff2fdc9c27698,Sporting News
sports,Bryan Murphy,2023-11-27T22:09:43+00:00,"The NHL's version of ""The Decision"" is almost here, as free agent winger Patrick Kane is closing in on signing with a team for the 2023-24.

OK, maybe it's not nearly as big as LeBron James' NBA free agency choice in 2010, but it's close. Kind of. Maybe tens years ago when Kane was in the middle of his prime, but I digress.

The three-time Stanley Cup champion has been on the market since the turn of the new season. The longtime Blackhawks star was traded last year at the deadline, as Kane wanted another shot at winning a Cup and was not interested in sticking around for Chicago's rebuild. He went to the Rangers, but New York was knocked out in the first round of the playoffs leaving Kane to hit free agency for the first time in his career.

It was announced during the summer that the winger would be undergoing surgery on his hip and that he likely would not make a decision until he was ready for a return. That's exactly how things played out, as the start of the season began with Kane not on an NHL roster, continuing to rehab from the offseason operation.

It's no secret that Kane isn't the offensive dynamo he was in his prime. He's always been a defensive liability, but it's stuck out more in recent years with his production on the decline. It's hard to say how much the hip injury affected his short time with the Rangers, but Kane was far from impressive in the Big Apple.

Regardless, the 35-year-old is ready to get back on the ice, and there are no shortages of interested suitors. Despite Kane's camp trying to keep everything hush-hush, the rumors and reports have been flying ever since the start of the campaign. It was reported that Kane could make a decision before Thanksgiving, but the holiday came and went without any news of a deal, however it is expected to come soon.

MORE: Ranking the NHL's top 50 players for the 2023-24 season

Here are some potential landing spots for Kane as he gets set to return to the NHL.

Patrick Kane potential destinations

Buffalo Sabres

The Sabres have a leg up on everyone when it comes to the Kane sweepstakes. The reason? The winger is a Buffalo native, having grown up in the southern part of the city. He has been connected to the Sabres dating back to last season when the rumors of an inevitable breakup between Kane and the Blackhawks began to surface, and Buffalo has plenty of cap space to sign the wing this time around.

Bringing in Kane would greatly help Buffalo's struggling offense and power play. Entering the final week of November, the Sabres are averaging 2.81 goals per game, the eighth-lowest mark in the league. The power play is clicking at 16.4%, 23rd in the NHL. The dynamic winger has collected about 32% of his career points on the man advantage, as he can be an excellent set-up man or one-time option on the dot.

The problem is that the Sabres have not been as good as expected to start the 2023-24 season. Buffalo was viewed as a team that would take the final step out of the rebuild this year, given how close the team was to the postseason last year. If Kane has his eyes set on joining a Stanley Cup contender, the Sabres are no longer atop that list, sitting under .500 and sixth in the Atlantic.

Florida Panthers

The Panthers are the defending Eastern Conference champions, and have continued the momentum from their Cinderella Cup run into the 2023-24 season, sitting tied for third in the conference and second in the Atlantic. In terms of contenders, they are right there in the East, and Kane could have the chance to play with a dynamic center like Aleksander Barkov.

Florida has an older group, so there would not be as much messing up the mojo like if Kane joined the baby Sabres. The Panthers don't have a ton of cap, but with roughly $1.7 million available, they could make it work. Plus, it's South Beach. Who wouldn't want to live in the Miami area and play hockey?

The issue could boil down to travel. There have been reports that Kane isn't as keen on signing in the Western Conference due to the lengthy hours spent going from arena to arena. Well, when it comes to the East, no one has it worse than the Panthers and Lightning, given their geographical location in Florida.

""To be perfectly honest, there was one person who said to me, look, if you’re worried about the travel in the Western Conference, why would you want to go to Florida when Florida and Tampa Bay have the worst travel in the Eastern Conference?"" Sportsnet's Elliotte Friedman reported. ""They’re remote outposts compared to a lot of the other places.""

Detroit Red Wings

When Kane was traded from the Blackhawks to the Rangers in the spring, it wasn't just to join a playoff contender. It was a reunion between Kane and his former Chicago teammate Artemi Panarin. The two created magic during Panarin's first two years in the NHL, leading to a Hart Trophy and Art Ross Trophy for Kane in 2015-16.

For the Red Wings, they don't have Panarin, but this summer, they did acquire one of Kane's other wing partners from the Blackhawks — Alex DeBrincat. Kane was DeBrincat's main set-up man when the current Red Wings star was potting 40 goals a season. Kane admitted in the past that when DeBrincat was traded from Chicago to Ottawa it was ""disappointing"" and ""crushing,"" and this would give him another shot at playing with the talented sniper.

""I’m really curious about the Detroit one,"" Friedman said. ""They have the cap room, they have the space on the roster, they’re doing very nicely so far this season. As we look on Sunday night, they’re sitting there very much in contention in the Atlantic Division and the Eastern Conference.

""So, I definitely think there’s a lot of people wondering about Detroit and whether or not he ends up there.

The Red Wings have the fifth-most cap space in the league, so money isn't an issue. It was assumed one of Buffalo, Ottawa or Detroit would take the last step out of the rebuild and become contenders, and through the early going, it looks like the Wings are that team. Adding Kane could be just the move the Winged Wheel needs to solidify their spot as a playoff contender.

Dallas Stars

One of the dark horse teams that could potentially land Kane is Dallas. The Stars look like one of the best teams in the Western Conference, and there have been reports that Kane would love to end up with the organization.

The thing is, the Stars already have tons of depth at forward. You could argue that, on paper, Dallas may have the deepest top-nine forward group in the league. Adding Kane would mean someone like Mason Marchment or Evgenii Dadonov gets dropped to the fourth line, and neither are fourth-line players.

Which is why it makes sense that the rumblings around the Stars and Kane are that the player is much more interested in the team than the other way around. The Stars are up against the cap, and would have to move money around to make it work financially.

""I think Kane would love to play there, I’m just not sure Dallas thinks it’s the best idea for them,"" Friedman said. ""I think they feel if they’re going to add, it’s going to be on defense.""

While adding Kane, who has a desire to play in Dallas, is appealing, don't fix what ain't broke, right?","Patrick Kane destinations: Sabres, Red Wings among potential landing spots for free agent winger",https://www.sportingnews.com/us/nhl/news/patrick-kane-destinations-free-agent-winger/64088479e9b5c46a32bcbbe8,Sporting News
sports,Sam Eggleston,2023-11-01T22:50:52+00:00,"Point spread betting is a bet on the difference in the score between teams (or players) in a specific game or event. The favored team is provided a point spread or handicap to try to equalize the odds with the less-favored team.

To place a point spread bet, select either the favored team or the underdog and predict if they will surpass or fall short of the given point spread. The odds for both teams are set to try to even out the bets on both sides.

The best sports betting sites provide a daily menu of point spread bets in dozens of sports and events.

What is a point spread bet?

A point spread is a predetermined margin set by bookmakers to level the playing field between two teams. Then, you bet on whether:

The favored team will win by more than the spread

or

The underdog will lose by less than the spread (or just win outright)

In a point spread, the favorite is the team expected to win and is typically assigned a negative point value, indicating the number of points by which they need to win for a bet on them to be successful.

The underdog is the team expected to lose and is typically assigned a positive point value, indicating the number of points they can lose by for a bet on them to be successful.

If the underdog wins the contest outright, they’re also the spread winner.

What does betting ‘against the spread’ mean?

Most generally, betting against the spread just means placing a point spread bet.

You’re betting on the underdog to either win outright or lose by fewer points than the specified point spread, or you’re betting on the favorite to win by a margin greater than the specified point spread.

In a secondary definition that distinguishes between betting “with the spread” or “against the spread,” the latter term means you’re betting on the underdog.

What does ‘covering the spread’ mean?

Covering the spread means that a team has surpassed the expectations set by the point spread and, thus, won the bet.

For the favorite, it means they won by more than the specified number of points. For the underdog, it means they either won outright or lost by fewer points than the specified spread.

How do point spread odds work?

Alongside point spread bets, the odds will indicate the potential payout relative to the wagered amount. These odds are typically close to even because the point spread is designed to level the playing field between two teams.

The odds can be presented in various formats, such as American (e.g., -110 or +110), Decimal (e.g., 1.91), and Fractional (e.g., 10/11), each providing a different way to express the same potential payout.

Do point spread odds change?

Yes, point spread odds can change, and these shifts are commonly referred to as ""line movement.""

Lines move when the point spread or the odds associated with a particular bet change after sportsbooks have initially set them. There are several reasons for these adjustments.

One of the most common causes is an imbalance in the amount of money being wagered on one side of the bet. If a significant majority of bettors are placing their money on one team to cover the spread, the top sports betting apps will adjust the point spread to make the other side more appealing, thereby balancing the betting action.

Another factor that can affect the spread odds is the occurrence of unexpected events, such as injuries to key players, changes in team strategies, or even significant weather events that might impact a game's outcome.

For instance, if a star quarterback is announced as injured just days before a big game, the point spread might shift in favor of the opposing team.

Moreover, information and public perception play a role. If a piece of news or a prevailing sentiment starts to gain traction about a particular team's increased chances of winning, this can influence how people bet, leading sportsbooks to adjust their lines accordingly.

Point spread odds can and do change based on a combination of actual betting patterns, unexpected events, and shifts in public perception. Savvy bettors keep a close eye on these line moves, as they can offer insights into where the value lies in a particular bet.

Point spread betting outcomes

When placing a point spread wager, there are a few potential outcomes:

The favorite can cover the spread by winning by a margin greater than the specified point spread

The underdog can either win the game outright or lose by fewer points than the spread, thereby ""covering"" the spread themselves

There's the possibility of a ""push,"" where the difference in the game's score exactly matches the point spread, resulting in the return of the original bet to all bettors

How to win a point spread bet

Suppose an NBA betting site has set the point spread for a Los Angeles Lakers-New York Knicks game at the Lakers -7.

This means the Lakers are the favorites and are expected to win by 7 points.

If you place a spread wager on the Lakers, to win your bet, the Lakers must win the game by more than 7 points.

Let's say the final score is Lakers 110, Knicks 100. The Lakers won by a margin of 10 points. Since this is more than the 7-point spread, if you bet on the Lakers, you would win your wager.

How you lose a point spread bet

Say an NFL betting site has set the point spread for a Chicago Bears-Miami Dolphins game at the Bears -4. This indicates that the Bears are the favorites and are expected to win by 4 points.

If you make a spread bet on the Bears, you're betting they'll win by more than 4 points.

However, let's assume the final score turns out to be Chicago Bears 24, Miami Dolphins 23. In this scenario, the Bears have won the game by only a 1-point margin.

Since this is less than the 4-point spread, if you had the Bears, you would lose your wager. Despite the Bears winning the game, they failed to ""cover"" the 4-point spread, leading to a loss for those who wagered on them.

What is a push in a spread bet?

A ""push"" in betting refers to a situation where the final result of an event matches the set point spread, resulting in neither a win nor a loss for bettors. When a push occurs, the wagers are typically refunded.

For instance, let's consider an NFL game where the Dallas Cowboys are favored by 7 points against the Philadelphia Eagles.

If the game ends with the Cowboys winning by exactly 7 points, those who bet on either team experience a push. Their wagers would be refunded as the Cowboys neither exceeded nor fell short of the 7-point spread.

Sportsbooks often employ half-points in their lines to avoid this scenario. (They don’t want to return bets.) For example, if our point spread was Cowboys -7.5, the game could not possibly end in a push.

Point spread betting by sport

Spread betting is popular across sports, but there can be slight differences. Let’s break it down.

Point spread odds in football

Say a hypothetical NFL point spread for the Patriots and Steelers has the Patriots as -5.5 favorites. If you bet on the Pats, they must win by 6 or more points for a winning wager. Betting on the Steelers would win if they either win outright or lose by 5 or fewer points.

Point spread odds in basketball

Say an NBA point spread has the Warriors as -9 favorites over the Raptors. To win a bet on the Warriors, they need to win by 10 or more points. Bets on the Raptors would win if they either win outright or lose by 8 or fewer points.

If the score is Warriors 110, Raptors 104, Raptors bets win since they lost by only 6 points. A 115-104 Warriors win would mean they covered the spread by 11 points.

Point spread odds in baseball

In a hypothetical MLB matchup between the Yankees and the Red Sox, the Yankees are set as -1.5 favorites on the ""run line"" (baseball’s point spread). Betting on the Yankees requires them to win by 2 or more runs.

For Red Sox bets to win, they must either secure a victory or lose by just 1 run. If the score ends Yankees 5, Red Sox 4, Red Sox bets win. Conversely, a 6-3 win for the Yankees covers the run line with a 3-run margin.

Point spread odds in hockey

At NHL betting sites, the ""puck line"" is akin to the point spread. In a game between the Canadiens and the Blackhawks, with the Canadiens as -1.5 favorites, they'd need to win by 2+ goals for their bettors to win.

Blackhawks bets win if they either triumph outright or lose by only one goal. If the score is Canadiens 3, Blackhawks 2, Blackhawks bets win since the Canadiens' one-goal victory doesn't cover the 1.5-goal spread. A 4-1 win for the Canadiens would mean they covered the spread by a 3-goal margin.

Point spread odds in soccer

In a hypothetical MLS game between LA Galaxy and Atlanta United, LA Galaxy is set as a -1 favorite on the goal line. They'd need to win by 2+ goals for bets on them to succeed. Atlanta United bets win if they either triumph outright or lose by a single goal.

With a score of LA Galaxy 2, Atlanta United 1, Atlanta bets win. However, a 3-1 win for LA Galaxy covers the spread with a 2-goal victory margin.

Point spread odds in tennis

At tennis betting sites, point spread betting is usually based on games or sets, termed ""game handicap"" or ""set handicap."" In a match between Serena Williams and Maria Sharapova, if Williams is a -4.5 favorite, she must win by a 5-game margin for her bettors to win.

For example, a match score of 6-4, 6-2 for Williams gives a 6-game margin, covering the -4.5 spread. Betting on Sharapova at +4.5 wins if she wins outright or Williams wins by fewer than 5 games. Set handicaps work similarly but focus on the number of sets won by each player.

Point spread odds in golf

In golf betting, betting often centers on outright winners or head-to-head matchups. However, there's also ""stroke handicap"" betting, akin to point spreads but with golf strokes.

For example, in a head-to-head bet between Tiger Woods and Jordan Spieth, if Woods is given a -2.5 stroke handicap as the favorite, he'd need to outplay Spieth by 3 strokes or more to win the bet.

Betting on Spieth at +2.5 means he either wins outright or Woods wins by just 1 or 2 strokes.

Point spread betting FAQ

How does point spread betting work?

Point spread betting is a form of wagering where a sportsbook assigns a ""spread"" to level the playing field between two teams. One team, deemed the favorite, will have points deducted, while the other team, the underdog, will have points added.

The favorite must win by more than the spread to ""cover"" and be considered a winning bet, while the underdog must either win outright or lose by fewer points than the spread to be a winning bet.

What does the (-) in point spread betting mean?

The ""(-)"" symbol denotes the favorite and indicates by how many points the favorite must win to ""cover"" the spread.

What does the (+) in point spread betting mean?

The ""(+)"" symbol denotes the underdog and indicates the additional points given to that team for the purposes of the bet.

What happens to my point spread bet if there’s a tie?

If a point spread bet results in a tie, also known as a ""push,"" most sportsbooks will refund the amount wagered. This means neither the bettor nor the sportsbook wins or loses money on that particular bet. To avoid pushes, sportsbooks often use half-points (like 7.5 or 6.5) in their spreads.

Looking at this question a different way, if there’s a tie in the literal matchup, many spread bets should still have winners and losers. Say the Cleveland Browns are -1.5 favorites over the Baltimore Ravens, but this NFL matchup ends in a 21-21 tie after overtime. The Ravens would win that spread bet because the margin of victory (0) was narrower than 1.5.

The 2022 Mr. Irrelevant has had a dream start to his NFL career, remaining unbeaten and being one of the better young shot callers in the league. But why is Purdy known as ""Mr. Irrelevant"" if he was pivotal for the 49ers?

Well, Mr. Irrelevant is the nickname given to the final pick of the NFL Draft. The Mr. Irrelevant title has been a staple of NFL Drafts since the 1976 Draft.

Grading Brock Purdy's draft class: How many QBs have done better than the 49ers QB so far?

Eight quarterbacks were selected before Purdy in the 2023 NFL Draft. Their names are Kenny Pickett (Pittsburgh Steelers), Desmond Ridder (Atlanta Falcons), Malik Willis (Tennessee Titans), Matt Corral (Carolina Panthers), Bailey Zappe (New England Patriots), Sam Howell (Washington Commanders), Chris Oladokun (Pittsburgh Steelers) and Skylar Thompson (Miami Dolphins). As you can tell, the ""Mr. Irrelevant"" of this Draft has had, by far, the best NFL career so far from the bunch.

The 2022 NFL Draft's Mr. Irrelevant is the franchise QB of one of the best teams in the NFL, the San Francisco 49ers. Since breaking into the starting lineup, Purdy has made a mockery of his ""Mr. Irrelevant"" tag. The Iowa State University alum was the first Mr. Irrelevant to make a forward pass in a regular season game successfully, and it has been up from there.

Purdy finished his rookie season with five consecutive regular-season victories, completing a 10-game winning streak by San Francisco to close the season. He carried on his regular season form to the postseason, leading the 49ers to an NFC Championship Game against the Philadelphia Eagles. Unfortunately, Purdy got hurt in the game, as the 49ers fell just short of a Super Bowl LVII appearance.

So far, Purdy has started the 2023 NFL season where he left off, opening the season with a 5-0 record. The San Francisco 49ers are the only franchise currently unbeaten in 2023 alongside their NFC foes, the Philadelphia Eagles. No quarterback has done better than Brock Purdy in his Draft class.

Grading the QBs in Brock Purdy's draft class

Now that we've listed the QBs selected ahead of Brock Purdy in his Draft class, it's high time we grade them. We'll start from the top.

1. Kenny Pickett, Pittsburgh Steelers, Pick 20 - B

Pickett is the starting quarterback for the Pittsburgh Steelers, and he has done a decent job in Pittsburgh. The University of Pittsburgh alum is a home-grown talent, and the fans are behind him. While he hasn't done anything special in the NFL just yet, he's one of just four QBs in the 2022 class that is currently an undisputed starter in the NFL.

2. Desmond Ridder, Atlanta Falcons, Pick 74 - C

Ridder earned the starting quarterback job for the Falcons ahead of the 2023 NFL season. He hasn't been spectacular this season, but at least he's starting games at the highest level.

3. Malik Willis, Tennessee Titans, Pick 86 - D

Willis is the QB2 or QB3 in Tennessee, depending on who you ask. That's interesting, considering that some draft analysts thought him the most naturally gifted QB in the 2022 Draft class. Unfortunately, he is fighting a losing battle in Tennessee, as the franchise drafted the highly rated Will Levis to take his place. A ""D"" grade might even be generous.

4. Matt Corral, Carolina Panthers, Pick 94 - E

The Panthers have mainly ignored Coral as they elected to trade up to number one for Bryce Young in the 2023 Draft. This tells you about the franchise's faith in the Ole Miss alum. Coral left the franchise ahead of his sophomore season.

5. Bailey Zappe, New England Patriots, Pick 137 - C-

Mac Jones' backup plays for the worst Patriots team of the past twenty years. It's not a dream spot for the Western Kentucky alum.

6. Sam Howell, Washington Commanders, Pick 144 - B

Howell is the franchise quarterback for the usually trigger-happy Washington Commanders franchise. This shows that the Commanders' new ownership group has faith in Howell's ability to quarterback the team. He gets a positive grade for that sole reason.

7. Chris Oladokun, Pittsburgh Steelers, Pick 241 - F

Oladokun is yet to make a start in the NFL. He'll be rated an F until he changes that. However, that won't be on the team that drafted him, as he was waived by the Steelers a while ago.

8. Skylar Thompson, Miami Dolphins, Pick 247 - D

Thompson is the third-string QB for the Miami Dolphins heading into 2023. He could be eligible for a Super Bowl ring if the Dolphins go all the way.

9. Brock Purdy, San Francisco 49ers, Pick 262 - A+

Arguably the best ""Mr. Irrelevant"" of all time. If Brock Purdy stays healthy in San Francisco, he can become one of his generation's finest QBs. We know it's cliché at this point, but we might have the next Tom Brady right in front of us!

sports,Damian Mannion,2023-10-18T21:30:00+00:00,"In November, it will have been a year since the deeply unpopular Glazer family left Manchester United fans rejoicing by announcing they were open to offers for England’s most iconic football club.

Eleven months on and the saga that, at times has resembled an X-Factor style judges houses audition, may finally be coming to an end as British petrochemicals billionaire Sir Jim Ratcliffe closes in on a partial takeover.

5 Sir Jim Ratcliffe has an offer on the table for 25 per cent stake of Manchester United Credit: AFP

Ratcliffe’s £1.3billion offer for a 25 per stake in the club he has supported since childhood will be high on the agenda when United’s board of directors meet on Thursday, but how did we get to this point, what happens next and what could the future look like at Old Trafford?

TIMELINE OF THE TAKEOVER SAGA

It was in November 2022 as Qatar became the centre of the football universe during the controversial 2022 World Cup that the Glazers revealed they were looking to cash in all or at least some of their shares.

The bombshell announcement was seen by the majority of Manchester United fans as the beginning of the end of the divisive and destructive regime that began with a now-outlawed leveraged buyout in 2005 and saddled the club with debts that at one stage soared to as high as £1bn.

Brothers Joel and Avram, the two most hands-on of the six Glazer siblings who have overall control of United, had instructed the New York-based Raine banking group to handle the bidding process.

This was a move mainly influenced by the fact Raine had managed to broker a deal with Todd Boehly to commit to invest £4.5bn to take control of Chelsea, giving the Glazers grand ideas they could rake in as much as DOUBLE for a global sporting institution like United.

After several rounds of bidding, it quickly became clear the race for United was a straight shootout between Oldham-born Ratcliffe, who had previously offered £4bn to buy Chelsea, and Qatari Sheikh Jassim bin Al Thani, who also professed to being a lifelong Red Devils fan and set up the ’92 Foundation’ in tribute to the famous class of ’92 of David Beckham and company.

5 Ratcliffe already owns Nice in France and Lausanne in Switzerland Credit: AFP

Initially it was hoped the bidding process would be concluded in time for the summer transfer window, but the longer it dragged on, prompting several large-scale protests from United fans, the more apparent it became that Joel and Avram were reluctant sellers, as revealed by talkSPORT in March.

Sheikh Jassim’s public statement promising to restore United ‘to former glories’ was also seen as thinly-veiled swipe at the Glazers, which did not help his negotiating hand.

The Qatari banker’s patience finally snapped and his withdrawal from the bidding process at the end of last week has left the pathway clear for Ratcliffe to complete what he has always viewed as his dream purchase.

WHAT ARE THE NEXT STEPS FOR RATCLIFFE?

talkSPORT understands Ratcliffe, having originally wanted a much larger up-front stake, has an agreement in principle to buy a 25 per cent share in United.

5 United supporters are desperate to see the Glazers depart Old Trafford Credit: Twitter

The fact the Glazers will remain in situ has not gone down well with supporters, but this is seen as the first step to Ratcliffe eventually removing the Americans and taking overall control.

The exact timescale as to when that happens remains vague and how much it will cost Ratcliffe overall could depend on United’s sporting and commercial success in the coming seasons.

Thursday’s board meeting was pre-arranged and while it is expected that Ratcliffe’s proposal will discussed in detail, sources close to United have indicated to talkSPORT that it is far from guaranteed it will be put to a vote with several details still to be thrashed out.

As and when it does get as far as a vote, Ratcliffe can be confident it will be ratified seeing as half of the 12-strong board are members of the Glazer family and in the event of a split vote, Joel and Avram as co-chairmen will have the deciding say.

Even once the final deal is agreed, it is likely to take at least a couple of months for Ratcliffe to pass the Premier League’s owners and directors test, which has been made more stringent since Portsmouth became the first top-flight side to go into administration in 2010.

5 Ratcliffe, one of Britain's wealthiest men, previously tried to buy Chelsea

WHAT DOES THE FUTURE LOOK LIKE UNDER RATCLIFFE’S INEOS GROUP?

Ratcliffe is demanding an executive role and overall control of day-to-day football matters and plans to appoint his own sporting director, with former Tottenham and Southampton transfer guru Paul Mitchell one of the main names in the frame.

That raises doubts over the future of current sporting director John Murtough and chief executive Richard Arnold, although manager Erik ten Hag is believed to be on a solid footing despite United’s poor start to the season.

Expect Sir Dave Brailsford, the mastermind behind Team GB’s cycling success at the London 2012 Olympics and director of sport for Ratcliffe’s company INEOS, to have a prominent role in any reshuffle.

Ratcliffe also has ambitious plans to upgrade Old Trafford and turn it into a 90,000-seat stadium.

He wants the deal ratified in time for the January transfer window, however due to FFP concerns, there is no guarantees United will be able to spend big.

Despite the fact he turns 71 a day before the board meeting, it appears Ratcliffe’s plans centre around long-term stability and success rather than a short-term turnaround in United’s fortunes.",Inside the Man United takeover and it’s anything but smooth sailing for Sir Jim Ratcliffe as he seeks board vote,https://talksport.com/football/1605672/man-utd-takeover-board-ratcliffe-stake-premier-league/,TalkSport

NBA live betting

Thanks to the increased popularity of online sports betting apps, in-game betting has exploded nationwide. Also known as live betting, in-game betting allows you to bet on a game while it’s unfolding.

The action is fast, and the odds are constantly shifting, making for a new way to enjoy the flow of a game while still staying engaged as a bettor.

Depending on the sportsbook, there is usually a strong variety of live betting opportunities. You’ll find game and player prop bets like whether the next bucket will be worth one, two, or three points.

You can bet on the team leading at the end of the current quarter or on whether there will be a comeback victory. You can even boil live betting down to the results of the next possession.

The most popular sportsbook apps, such as DraftKings, FanDuel, and BetMGM, offer NBA in-game betting, though each has its lines and betting opportunities.

What makes NBA betting special or unique?

Basketball odds are known to fluctuate more than those of other sports. The factors that play into those lines shifting can range from having only a few impact players per team to the sheer frequency of games.

By following a single team, you can track its momentum swings, which players tend to get on hot or cold streaks, or how well they play at home vs. on the road. You can use that information to your advantage for both pre-game and live wagers.

Similar categories of moneylines, spreads, totals, and NBA prop bets should appear across both formats.

The NBA is also special because of the number of bets available for every game, ranging from pre-game to live betting and parlays.

When you add up the standard bets, game props, player props, in-game betting, and more, there’s a staggering volume of bets for every NBA game at online sportsbooks.

NBA spreads, money lines, and over/unders

For anyone new to NBA betting, the staple wager types are:

NBA point spreads: Bet on games via margins of victory or loss. Say the New York Knicks are -7.5 favorites over the Miami Heat. That means the Knicks need to win the game by 8 points to win a spread bet. On the other hand, the Heat can lose by up to 7 points (or win outright).

NBA moneylines: The simplest form of betting. You pick the winner of the game, and if you’re right, you’ll get paid out based on the odds when you finalize your bet slip. Favorites to win the game are shown negative odds, such as -135, while the underdogs will have positive odds, like +165.

NBA over/under bets: Also known as totals. These bets are focused on the combined point total of the two teams playing in a game. (Winners and losers don’t matter.) For example, the over/under could be set at 211.5 points in the Knicks vs. Heat matchup. If you were to pick the over on the bet, you’d need the two teams to combine for 212 points or more to win. They need to score 211 points or fewer if you went with the under.

NBA props and futures

NBA player and team props are growing in popularity. Sportsbooks are taking note and providing more NBA props than ever.

After all, it’s much easier to focus on a single player and how he will perform than the entire team. Player props could focus on how many points a player scores or how many rebounds he pulls down. These are typically provided in an over/under format.

Then, team props can range from which team will score the first bucket to the total points scored in a quarter to which team will lead at halftime. The selection is often robust, especially when high-profile teams play.

Futures bets are exactly what their name implies: bets on events that will happen in the future. Common futures markets include:

and much more. You can usually bet on NBA futures odds throughout the year, including well before the season starts and throughout the regular season. The further away from the event, the more likely you will find heavier odds in your favor.

Is NBA betting legal in the U.S.?

In the US, the landscape of sports betting, specifically NBA betting, has evolved considerably. While NBA betting is permitted, its legality varies across the nation. The significant turning point came in 2018 when the US Supreme Court made a pivotal decision. It overturned a longstanding federal law and allowed individual states the autonomy to determine their own sports betting regulations.

sports,Barney Ronay at Old Trafford,2023-12-12T23:53:03+00:00,"As the seconds ticked down at the end of a Champions League season‑ender that felt like a gentle, even quite tender, act of sporting euthanasia, the only noise inside Old Trafford was the sound of the Bayern Munich fans singing an impressively sustained version of Football’s Coming Home. A little later they sang Is This A Library? Actually, no, it’s more of a museum. They chanted “Auf Wiedersehen” at the departing members of the home support who, frankly, had done pretty well to stick it out to that point.

The good news for Erik ten Hag at the end of this low-fi 1-0 defeat is that United’s players didn’t lie down and die at Old Trafford. Instead they stood up and died, running hard and creating a kind of simulacrum of a functioning elite team.

This was not a group of players in revolt or drained of spirit. They looked like what they are, a muddled creation, stitched together out of parts and off-cuts. In the second half United’s back five was André Onana, Aaron Wan-Bissaka, Jonny Evans, Raphaël Varane and Diogo Dalot, an entirely random collection of players signed, at various times, by Ten Hag, José Mourinho, Ole Gunnar Solskjær and Alex Ferguson. Presumably Daley Thompson, Michael Portillo and Howard from Take That were busy.

By the end United had five academy players on the pitch, ages ranged between 17 and 35, in outline evidence of internal good health, in reality another symptom of a machine that wants to function properly but has for so long been made to judder along at half-speed. Ever feel like you’re starting to slip into the past tense for good? When VAR happens at Old Trafford there isn’t even a VAR screen to say “VAR Check”. The 1990s were a hell of a decade. They still are around here.

'We've lost decisive players': Ten Hag says injuries were key to Champions League exit – video

So much for the good news then. The bad news is that Ten Hag’s United have now compiled arguably the worst performance by any English team in a Champions League group stage. OK, it’s no Blackburn Rovers. But there are extra marks here for United’s pedigree, for the fact the group really wasn’t much of a group, and for United managing to finish bottom, shipping 15 goals in the process, more than any other English team ever.

Plus of course there were just so many moments of farce along the way, a six-part saga of chaos, collapse and laughter in the dark. We remember Onana diving out of the way of the ball in Munich. We remember Onana also diving out of the way of the ball in Istanbul. Casemiro’s red card, lost leads in Manchester, Marcus Rashford unfairly convicted of a venomous stamp in Copenhagen, when frankly, he’s just not that kind of semi-interested footballer.

And yet with both group games blank at half-time United were still just one goal away here from going through to the last 16, which really would have made for an excellent punchline. It wasn’t to be. For all their own flaws Bayern are basically a good version of whatever it is United are attempting to piece together. Kimmich‑Goretzka‑Musiala is an A grade version of Amrabat‑McTominay‑Fernandes. Manuel Neuer is the thing Onana is trying so earnestly to be. Bayern actually did go ahead and sign Harry Kane.

They held the ball nicely, probed in neat, clipped, mannered attacks. A lot seemed to hinge on how desperately Bayern felt the need to twist that scalpel, whether they could really be bothered to take this thing to the wall. United defended well. Their waves of pressing drew waves of applause. Everyone here seemed to be trying.

But with 58 minutes gone Copenhagen scored and United’s hopes began to slip beneath the waves. Just over 10 minutes later Bayern made it 1-0 in Manchester. Kingsley Coman got it, granted a huge expanse of time and space in front of the United goal, enough to set himself, as though taking a penalty, and belt the ball into the corner. The moment was made by a delightfully sneaky round‑the‑corner pass from Kane. After all that pressure, all that tender hope, it looked a bit like a training goal.

And that was pretty much that. From here United’s season continues to narrow. They can’t win the league now, can’t win the Champions League, can’t win the Carabao Cup. They still have the FA Cup, and the extended pursuit of fourth or even fifth place, although the state of the coefficient means the thing that might keep Manchester United out of Europe next season could be Manchester United being so bad in Europe this season. Maybe City can revive their fortunes by winning the Champions League again.

Ten Hag will take the blame of course for the early exit and plenty of mistakes have been made, not least in the players the manager has been allowed to sign. In reality assessing the job any United manager does with this team involves applying a series of filters. To be United manager is to undertake three concurrent roles.

First you must manage the past, which is constantly in the room and which skews every act, achievement and expectation. Second you must manage the dysfunction of the present, which expresses itself in every detail from a leaking stadium roof to the deep ills of a playing squad peopled with squatters and long‑term missteps.

Finally you get to manage the everyday metrics on which you will be judged; team, results, style, energy, messaging. Win things, improve players, create a coherent and happy internal culture: but do it during an unceasing takeover circus while star players sulk and brief against you, while the ghost of Hamlet’s father still skulks in the eaves. This felt like the end of one thing, perhaps even the beginning of the end of something else.",Ten Hag’s Manchester United stand up and die at club stuck in the past tense | Barney Ronay,https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2023/dec/12/ten-hags-manchester-united-stand-up-and-die-at-club-stuck-in-the-past-tense,The Guardian
sports,Simon Burnton at the Brian Lara Stadium,2023-12-21T23:45:58+00:00,"What a difference two days make. Somehow Tuesday’s ludicrous, record-smashing, high-scoring entertainment was followed by a sequel on the same surface that eventually delivered thrilling low-scoring entertainment, and a different result claimed in very different style. It was eventually won for West Indies with four balls to spare and in the most unfitting of ways – with a massive six – by Shai Hope, again proving himself the right man for a run-chase.

So a series marked by stunning power hitting, roaring run rates and an unexpected midway transformation in England’s performances and prospects concluded with a 3-2 triumph for West Indies, who extended their supremacy over England at home to four series in three formats across nearly five years.

England assembled exactly the same players in exactly the same place and exactly the same situation – losing the toss, put in to bat – but this was an entirely different performance. A wicket once so true turned untrustworthy and they struggled to a score of 132, less than half the 267 to which they had joyously motored just 48 hours previously. And though the home side’s response was anything but overwhelming, neither was the result ever in significant doubt.

“We’ve had some high-scoring games, but the last game was almost the complete opposite of what happened here,” Reece Topley said. “We were probably just under par with the first-innings score but with the ball we were excellent, pushed them right to the end. I think it’s been an amazing series. Both teams have played some unbelievable cricket. I was so excited turning up today, because it was basically a final and those are the games you want to play in and be on the right side of. The bottom line is you want to win this series, I want to win every series I can for England.”

Often there is a sense as a tour enters its final days of thoughts turning to home, and perhaps the focus was not as laser-sharp as it might have been for this game, determination less than absolute to grasp this opportunity to end England’s run of reverses in the Caribbean. Whatever the reason, the pyrotechnics that rocketed England to victory in the two previous matches never sparked in this one. It took a fabulous delivery from Gudakesh Motie to end Phil Salt’s run of absurd form with his score a modest 38, but some of the other wickets that fell during the period that defined England’s innings and the game seemed a little careless.

In the fourth over Jos Buttler casually turned a Jason Holder delivery to fine leg, where Oshane Thomas was positioned, hands cupped. Harry Brook tried to paddle-sweep Motie but sent the ball only a few feet into the air, giving Nicholas Pooran an easy catch. That made it 70 for four and the game was one ball into its ninth over, at which point Liam Livingstone and Moeen Ali had to focus for a while on disaster prevention rather than entertainment.

Suddenly bowlers were energised by the prospect of posting, for a change, less-than-humiliating figures. Akeal Hosein’s were outstanding, his four overs going for just 20 and bringing the wickets of Will Jacks and Moeen, undone by a relay catch on the boundary after combining with Livingstone to add 40 for the fifth wicket. Livingstone followed precisely two overs later, prodding the ball limply back into the hands of Motie, at which point things really fell apart, the last five wickets surrendered in 20 balls for just 11 runs.

Just as surely as when they came out on Tuesday facing an almost unachievable task, the outcome of the West Indies’ run chase seemed inevitable from the start. With such a meagre target they needed little more than to keep their heads, and though both Topley and Sam Curran conceded only two with their final overs to push the contest into its final over, that never looked in doubt.

Halfway through their innings they were 62 for three, and if England had 15 more runs at the same point they had also made a complete hash of the rest of it. That was a trap which, thanks to Hope’s 43-ball 43 as he again steered his side to their target, West Indies avoided. This batting display may have lacked their usual flamboyance but until the final ball it was entirely appropriate for the occasion.

Amid the wider theme of transformation Adil Rashid’s excellence remains constant. The 35-year-old, who rose to the top of the T20 bowling rankings for the first time on Wednesday, took two wickets and conceded just 21 while Topley was even better, also claiming a pair of victims but conceding only 17. England take plenty of positives from this series, but the result was not one.",West Indies clinch T20 series after Shai Hope edges hosts past England total,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/dec/21/west-indies-clinch-t20-series-after-shai-hope-edges-hosts-past-england-total,The Guardian
sports,Isaac Thorn,2023-12-21T19:35:54+00:00,"The Buffalo Bills (8-6) will be the first foes Los Angeles Chargers (5-9) interim head coach Giff Smith will face when the teams meet at SoFi Stadium in this Week 16 Saturday matchup. The Bills enter QB Josh Allen’s home state as 12-point favorites with the OVER/UNDER set at 44.

This game features one team heating up and looking like a unit no one will want to face in the playoffs, while the other is sifting through the rubble of a disastrous 2023 season and building for 2024 and beyond.

Buffalo is in the thick of the AFC wild card hunt, trailing three other 8-6 teams (Bengals, Colts, Texans) by tiebreakers going into this week. They’re also riding high on the heels of their dominant 31-10 Week 15 home win over the Cowboys, led by RB James Cook’s 25-179-1 rushing bonanza. While Buffalo has had their ups and downs this year, if they make the postseason with their rushing game producing like this they will be an extremely tough out.

The Chargers are coming off a brutal 63-21 Thursday Night Football rout at the hands of the Raiders, which led to Los Angeles firing head coach Brandon Staley and GM Tom Telesco. Los Angeles was already twisting in the wind after QB Justin Herbert’s season-ending hand injury, but the magnitude of their 38-point loss last week was embarrassing enough to cause the team to clean house midseason.

Bills betting news: Buffalo aims to continue hot streak ATS

Buffalo is 6-7-1 ATS in 2023, and to say this team is streaky in this regard would be an understatement. The Bills went 3-1 ATS in their first four, but that ride on the gravy train was interrupted by what came next: a brutal six-game stretch between Weeks 5-10 where they failed to cover once.

The Bills appear to have moved past their midseason ATS doldrums, riding a 3-0-1 streak into Week 16.

We often see several versions and levels of a team throughout the year, and with the Bills it largely boils down to their ground game. Ty Johnson and Latavius Murray are serviceable RBs but lack the game-breaking speed and big play ability that James Cook offers.

Before Week 15, Cook hadn’t rushed more than 17 times in a game. After carrying 25 times vs. Dallas (and earning AFC Offensive Player of the Week status), BIlls fans must be extremely hopeful that their offensive attack continues to involve Cook handling more than 20 rushes per game.

Cook’s 179-yard outburst coupled with backup Ty Johnson’s shoulder injury in Week 15 should both contribute to Cook garnering 20-plus touches this week.

Chargers betting news: Los Angeles limps toward the finish line

The Chargers were supposed to be good but are not. It seemed unlikely that coach Brandon Staley was going to be their guy past this year, especially on the heels of their crushing playoff exit in Jacksonville where they blew a 27-point lead and lost in historic fashion. However, giving up 63 points to a team that had just been shut out 3-0 four days earlier was enough to cause Los Angeles ownership to hit the shred button.

They’re 4-9-1 ATS and have failed to cover in five of their last six games. Given what we saw from the team while being shredded so badly on TNF last week, it’s going to take some big spreads and some sort of spark from their interim head coach Giff Smith for them to cover anything the rest of the way this season.

Justin Herbert’s replacement, Easton Stick, amassed an impressive line of 23-for-32 for 257 yards passing and a TD in Week 15, but he also had fumble and interception returns against him within about 25 seconds between the end of the third quarter and the start of the fourth.

Betting on or against QBs that nobody has seen play can be tricky, but focusing on OVER/UNDER betting trends for the Chargers is not. Los Angeles has gone under in 10 of their 12 games, which would make you think they’re likely to keep doing so the rest of 2023.

However, the OVER/UNDER resting at 44 this week seems tantalizingly low. Buffalo has averaged 29 PPG in their last four, and with Stick throwing TDs but also turning the ball over at a high rate, that figure might be easily surpassed.

Bill vs. Chargers props

Two props for the Bills vs. Chargers Week 16 game worth considering:

Dalton Kincaid UNDER receptions

Kincaid was a limited participant in practice on Wednesday due to a shoulder injury, but it’s been reported he’s likely to suit up on Saturday at less than 100%. This prop suggestion centers completely on the inference that Kincaid suits up but takes part in less packages and plays than usual. With Buffalo likely to cruise, this isn’t a far-fetched chain of events to target.

Gerald Everett OVER receiving yards

Whether Easton Stick continues to play decently or if he doesn’t, this prop line for receiving yards should be attainable for Chargers TE Gerald Everett in Week 16. Everett has tallied 41, 39, 44 and 43 receiving yards in his last four outings. The Bills are likely to score a lot, necessitating that Los Angeles passes a lot. Even if this wasn’t a game with such a big spread, it is a small ask to suggest that Everett can net half of what he’s averaged in the past month.

Bills vs. Chargers prediction: Bills continue to roll

The Chargers new coach isn’t going to be able to right all his team’s wrongs overnight, but losing by less than 38 would be a great place to start. Look for Buffalo to try to replicate their massive success running the ball last week vs. Dallas, and for the Los Angeles defense to begin sagging heavily in the second half. The Bills can beat the Chargers through the air but will probably run a copy of their Week 15 game plan vs. L.A. and every team that comes their way after.

sports,Edward Sutelan,2023-10-14T22:00:05+00:00,"In a game with names like Caleb Williams, Sam Hartman, Zachariah Branch and Audric Estime, it felt like there might be no more room for anyone else to play the role of hero.

Enter Xavier Watts. The Notre Dame safety was a wrecking ball against Williams and the USC offense, picking off Williams twice, forcing a fumble and taking another fumble in for a score. Williams finished the contest with arguably the worst game of his career as No. 21 Notre Dame rode the crucial turnovers and a relentless pass-rush to an overwhelming 48-20 win at home against No. 10 USC.

""I think the entire team was hungry,"" Notre Dame coach Marcus Freeman said after the game. ""We had a sour taste in our mouth. But the reality is that I've told those guys just compete against [Williams]. He's gonna make plays, he's a great football player, but be relentless in terms of your effort, your attitude, how you attack that guy and to come up big with five turnovers is really impressive.""

Right from the start, it was cleat Notre Dame was going to make things hard on the reigning Heisman Trophy winner. Just four plays into the game, Williams over-threw Lake McRee and Watts picked it off, returning it 38 yards to USC's 12 and setting Notre Dame up for a quick three-play scoring drive.

Midway through the third quarter, with Notre Dame leading 10-3, Williams again threw a pick to Watts, this time Watts nearly returned it to the end zone before he was stopped at the USC 2. Audric Estime finished the job, scoring the first of two touchdowns to give USC the 17-3 lead. Williams threw another interception on the following drive, the first time he had ever thrown three picks in a single game in his career, and Notre Dame again cashed in the turnover for seven more points.

Late in the fourth quarter, with USC desperately trying to stay in the game, Watts recovered a fumble after a reception by Mario Williams and raced it into the end zone. Following that turnover, with his team trailing 48-20, Lincoln Riley pulled the starters. The backup running back fumbled the ball on USC's final drive, forced by — guess who — Watts, and Notre Dame ran down the clock from there.

""Just thank you to all my teammates,"" Watts said after the game. ""None of that would have happened without them. All the pressure they brought, the good coverage down the field.""

In a season in which so much has been made of USC's defensive woes holding back the offense, it was the other way around on Saturday. USC's defense held Notre Dame to just 251 total yards of offense, 51 fewer than the offensive yards by the Trojans. Notre Dame was only three-for-10 on third down compared to six-of-13 by USC. But a 5-0 turnover margin will be difficult for any team to overcome, and it frequently helped Notre Dame have only a short field to work with. The Fighting Irish, on average, started drives at their own 47, while the Trojans began drives on average at their own 28.

Watts made the headline-grabbing plays, but a massive part of the Fighting Irish's defensive success came in the trenches. The defensive line by Notre Dame tallied six sacks of Williams and three more hits as it frequently pressed the Trojan quarterback. Williams finished the game just 23-for-37 with 199 passing yards with one passing touchdown and three picks.

10:47 p.m.: With the Trojans down by 28 with 3:27 left, Williams is done for the day with Miller Moss coming into the game. The Trojans start their drive with a 10-yard run by Quinten Joyner. Joyner fumbles the ball on the next play, and it is recovered by Notre Dame's Javontae Jean-Baptiste at the USC 36.

10:46 p.m.: USC will start the drive at its own 25.

10:44 p.m. Notre Dame scoring play: It continues to get worse for Notre Dame. Mario Williams loses a fumble after a three-yard reception, and Watts, who had already intercepted two passes, scoops up the ball and takes it into the end zone. Notre Dame 48, USC 20

10:43 p.m.: The Notre Dame special teams again halt Branch early on his return, stopping him at the USC 17.

10:37 p.m.: Estime getting the ball to start the drive again as Notre Dame looks to wind this one away. He rushes for gains of seven yards and then another as USC uses its final timeout with 3:54 left with Notre Dame heading to a third-and-2.

10:33 p.m.: Williams is sacked by Jaylen Sneed for a loss of eight back to the USC 14, and that should all but put this one out of reach. Notre Dame leads by 18 with 4:49 left with the ball deep in USC territory.

10:29 p.m.: False start moves USC back again, the second false start penalty on this drive. Williams finds Jackson for eight yards, but it brings up a fourth-and-9 and the Trojans' offense stays out there. Notre Dame calls a timeout.

10:28 p.m.: Williams evades several defenders before eventually getting sacked for a loss of two. He then fires an incompletion as USC faces another crucial third-down, this one from 12 yards out.

10:26 p.m.: A rush for a loss of one and a false start penalty backed up USC inside its own 5. Williams picks up six yards to set up a third-and-9 at the 11. He then connects with Jackson for a 10-yard pass up the middle to keep the drive going with just under seven minutes to play.

10:23 p.m.: The past two special teams play have been dynamic, but this one is stopped up short as Branch is tackled at the USC 20. Holding on USC backs the Trojans up 10 yards to the 10.

10:21 p.m. Notre Dame scoring play: Well, that didn't take long for the Fighting Irish to respond. Price goes 99 yards, racing past the Trojans through the middle and cutting left before going all the way for the touchdown. Notre Dame 38, USC 20

10:17 p.m. USC scoring play: Williams finally picks up his first passing touchdown of the game, dancing in the pocket before connecting with Rice in the end zone for the score. That makes it an 11-point game with 9:04 left. Notre Dame 31, USC 20

10:15 p.m.: USC leaning on its running game to start the drive, with Jones picking up eight yards combined on his two carries to set up a third-and-2 from the Notre Dame 10. He then rushes up the middle for three to set up a first-and-goal at the 7.

10:13 p.m.: An explosive punt return from Branch, who dances around the field and burns down the left sideline, being stopped only by the punter at the Notre Dame 18 to prevent a touchdown. USC ball with 11:13 left to play, with Notre Dame leading by 18.

10:12 p.m.: Notre Dame picks up just a yard, then Jadarian Price is tackled for no gain. Hartman fires an incomplete pass, and the Fighting Irish will have to punt.

10:10 p.m.: Notre Dame converts the third down with Hartman firing a quick strike to Staes for seven yards up to the Fighting Irish 33.

10:09 p.m.: The start of the fourth quarter looks like a lot like most of the second half so far: back-to-back runs by Estime. He picks up five yards on successive carries to bring up a third-and-5.

Third quarter

10:05 p.m.: Estime ends the third quarter with an impressive run to the left, hitting the hole and ultimately being brought down at the Notre Dame 21 by Zion Branch after a gain of 14.

10:04 p.m.: False start backs USC up before the punt. The punt from Eddie Czaplicki is still a good one as it goes out of bounds at the Notre Dame 7 with eight seconds left in the third quarter.

10:03 p.m.: Notre Dame lets Williams have the 10-yard completion to Jackson on a wide receiver screen, but it will still bring up a Trojan punt.

10:02 p.m.: Notre Dame's defensive line gets to Williams again, this time it's Rylie Mills and Nana Osafo-Mensah bringing Williams down for a loss of eight, and USC is backed up all the way to a third-and-28.

10:01 p.m.: Williams finds Jackson open right over the middle for 10 yards and the first down. The Trojans keep the up-tempo moving, but he is sacked for a loss of eight by Marist Liufau, dropping him back to the USC 44.

9:59 p.m.: A batted pass and a rush for four by Lloyd bring up a third-and-6 for the Trojans from their own 32. Notre Dame uses its first timeout of the half before the Trojans can get that third-down play off.

9:58 p.m.: Williams comes out of the gate firing, hitting Washington on the sideline at the 38 for 13 yards and a first down.

9:58 p.m.: USC will start at its own 25.

9:53 p.m. Notre Dame scoring play: Hartman uncorks a deep ball down the middle of the field and finds the speedy Tyree on the run. Tyree races the rest of the 15 yards into the end zone to score the touchdown and push Notre Dame's lead back out to 18. Notre Dame 31, USC 13

9:52 p.m.: Evans, back in the field after an injury earlier in the quarter, catches a short pass and fights his way through contact to pick up the first down and tally eight yards up to the USC 46.

9:50 p.m.: The Fighting Irish are feeding Estime to start the drive. Estime runs up the middle for seven yards, another to the right for four yards and a first down and then a third run for three yards.

9:49 p.m.: Solid return by Ford will give the Fighting Irish the ball to start at their own 32.

9:45 p.m. USC scoring play: The Trojans have their first touchdown of the evening, as after a rush by Williams for four yards, Lloyd carves through the left side of the defense off a pitch from Williams and breaks loose for a 31-yard touchdown. Notre Dame 24, USC 13

9:44 p.m.: Williams bails USC out of another second-and-long, finding McKree up the middle and on the run, allowing him to move up for 21 to pick up the first down.

9:43 p.m.: Impressive play by Branch just to get back to the line of scrimmage after a reverse. Williams then connects with Singer on a pass down the right sideline, and Singer darts up for a gain of 11. But the Trojans give that yardage nearly all the way back after he was sacked for a loss of 10.

9:42 p.m.: Trading PI calls, as now Notre Dame is penalized for pass interference after Williams tried to find Rice on a deep shot down the middle. Morrison is called for the penalty, his third of the night. USC moves back to its own 43.

9:40 p.m.: USC is called for its second offensive pass interference penalty, with Mario Williams being flagged after a 10-yard catch by Washington. The Trojans will now have a first-and-25.

9:37 p.m.: Another short pass by Hartman, and Calen Bullock makes a great open-field play to tackle Ford after just a yard. Notre Dame punts, and Branch returns it 21 yards up to his team's 43.

9:36 p.m.: Faison manages to get a yard on a short pass, then Love picks up four on the ground to set up a third-and-5 at the Notre Dame 30.

9:32 p.m.: Tyree returns the punt two yards up to the Notre Dame 25, where the Fighting Irish will begin their drive.

9:31 p.m.: USC goes three-and-out quickly, with Williams throwing an incompletion, a pass for a loss of four and another incompletion. Trojans still looking lost on offense.

9:29 p.m.: Branch boots the 50-yard punt, but he's able to hop back on it and ensure USC retains possession. The Trojans will begin the drive from their own 30.

9:28 p.m.: Evans was injured on the play, and though he was able to walk off the field, he had to go to the blue tent. Hartman then throws a short pass to Holden Staes for three and misses him on the third-down try, forcing out the punting unit after a three-and-out.

9:26 p.m.: Hartman opens the drive with a play-action deep shot out to Evans, but the pass was broken up by Roland-Wallace, the second time he's defended a pass out to Evans.

9:25 p.m.: The third quarter is under way, with Notre Dame beginning its drive at the 22 after a 17-yard return from Ford.

Second quarter

9:03 p.m. USC scoring play: The Trojans make the most of the defensive miscue and forced timeout and boot a 48-yard field goal to at least get closer, but this has been a disastrous half for the Trojans. Notre Dame 24, USC 6

9:02 p.m.: This Notre Dame defense continues to get after Williams, with Boubacar Traore sacking the quarterback for a loss of six. USC tries to snap the ball with several Notre Dame defenders in the backfield, but Marcus Freeman gets a timeout in time to prevent the penalty.

9:01 p.m.: Williams fires a strike to a streaking Washington, who then takes it 14 yards for a first down to the Notre Dame 25. Williams is then pressured and has to throw the ball away.

9 p.m.: USC runs the ball for four yards up the middle to bring up a third-and-3, and is now forced to burn its last timeout with 30 seconds left in the half.

8:57 p.m.: Back-to-back big plays by the Trojans, with Williams first hitting Washington for nine, then hitting Mario Williams for a pickup of 20. He then scrambles for three yards as USC uses a timeout with 39 seconds left. USC has a second-and-7 from the Notre Dame 43.

8:56 p.m.: USC will start the drive at the 25 after a touchback.

8:54 p.m. Notre Dame scoring play: Estime powers ahead from a yard out, and the Fighting Irish are dominating the Trojans. Just 1:30 left to play in the first half. Notre Dame 24, USC 3

8:52 p.m.: Back-to-back runs by Estime for five and eight yards sets up Notre Dame at the USC 1 with a first-and-goal.

8:51 p.m.: Now Hartman's putting his legs to work, scrambling for 12 yards to the right side to set up a first-and-10 at the USC 4.

8:50 p.m.: Hartman responds to the pick by throwing a perfect deep pass to Flores, dropping the ball in his hands 24 yards out along the sideline to move up to the USC 26.

8:50 p.m.: This has been a half to forget for Williams. He again throws a pass into double coverage, and is again picked off, this time by Morrison.

There's just something special about 2️⃣0️⃣ in prime time 🤩#GoIrish☘️ pic.twitter.com/uzKZ40XseE — Notre Dame Football (@NDFootball) October 15, 2023

8:48 p.m.: Williams connects with Mario Williams for 10 yards and a first down after missing Washington on a deep ball to start the drive. He then has to throw the ball away after he gets chased in the backfield by Bertrand.

8:42 p.m.: Williams throws his second interception of the game, trying to find Singer but instead hitting Watts again in double coverage for Watts' second pick of the game after the ball was tipped at the line. He had one interception all season, and now has thrown two, both to Watts.

8:40 p.m.: Williams finds Rice on a crossing route, but he drops the pass. The next play, Williams fires a quick pass to Branch in the slot, and he takes the ball up 10 yards for the first down to the 16.

8:36 p.m.: Branch returns the USC punt up to the Trojans' 25 for 12 yards. A holding penalty brings the ball all the way back to the USC 6.

8:35 p.m.: Estime picked up four yards on the ground to start the drive, but Hartman missed a deep shot to Faison on the second-down play. He tries to find Evans up the middle, but Christian Roland-Wallace swats the ball out of Evans' hands to force the three-and-out.

8:31 p.m.: This time, Jones is halted almost as soon as he picked up the handoff from Williams, getting brought down by JD Bertrand for a loss of four and giving the Fighting Irish the ball at their own 33.

8:31 p.m.: Jones is stopped a yard short on the third-down run, and the Trojans again face a fourth-and-1. The offense stays out on the field.

8:30 p.m.: Branch shows off his explosiveness, blazing ahead for 17 yards to set up a much more manageable third-and-3 at the Fighting Irish 31.

8:28 p.m.: Following an incompletion, Williams appeared to score a 38-yard rushing touchdown to tie the game at 10. However, left guard Emmanuel Pregnon is called for offensive holding, bringing the play all the way back and making it a second-and-20 for the Trojans.

8:27 p.m.: Williams rewards the decision to go for it, as he keeps the ball on an option and picks up eight yards up to the Notre Dame 38.

8:25 p.m.: This time, Lloyd's going backwards as DJ Brown makes an impressive solo tackle to bring him down three yards behind the line of scrimmage. USC punts the ball away, but Notre Dame is called for running into the kicker, which sets up a fourth-and-1. The Trojans will go for it.

8:24 p.m.: Williams tries to connect with Rice on a deep shot after off-setting penalties reset the downs, but the two can't connect. Lloyd picks up seven yards bouncing out to the right and beating two defenders to move into Notre Dame territory.

8:22 p.m.: Williams connects with Mario Williams right at the line of scrimmage to convert the third-and-4 at the USC 45.

8:21 p.m.: Jet sweep by Washington picks up 10 to the USC 35, following by a rush of six by Jones right up the middle. Trojans now have 47 yards on the ground as they look to wake their offense up in the first half.

8:20 p.m.: USC will start its drive from its own 25.

8:16 p.m. Notre Dame scoring play: On a third-and-7, Hartman throws a short pass out to Mitchell Evans, who is stopped right away only for a gain of five. Notre Dame is forced to settle for the 36-yard field goal, which Spencer Shrader successfully boots. Notre Dame 10, USC 3

8:14 p.m.: Make it back-to-back plays as Faison is handed the ball on a reverse, fooling the USC defense, and freeing up space down the right sideline to move up 16 yards to the UCS 26.

Big gain for @NDFootball with the reverse!

7:58 p.m.: Williams fires a strike up the middle to Dorian Singer to the Notre Dame 35 following a pickup of one on the ground by Jones, and the Trojan offense is rolling.

7:56 p.m.: Williams is flushed out of the pocket and scrambles for a gain of 11. Notre Dame is called for a defensive holding penalty on the play as well that adds to it for the Trojans, who have now moved all the way up to the Notre Dame 46.

sports,Kyle Bonn,2023-11-06T22:06:19+00:00,"London derbies are always full of venom and vigor, but the opening 45 minutes of Tottenham vs. Chelsea on Monday produced one of the greatest train wrecks in the history of the English top flight.

With repeated refereeing blunders one of the main talking points of the season thus far, a half full of VAR checks and highly scrutinized decisions caused absolute chaos on the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium pitch.

All told, one red card and four yellow cards were produced by Michael Oliver with help from VAR official John Brooks, while Chelsea saw goals ruled out on an incredible four separate occasions. It resulted in an incredible 12 minutes of stoppage time, and while many of the decisions were widely analysed as correct, the lengthy review processes were criticised just as much as the eventual results.

The first half would end level at 1-1, with Tottenham reduced to 10 men, and Premier League fans had plenty to talk about with friends, fans, and coworkers. The Sporting News breaks down each memorable moment in what was an action-packed opening 45 minutes.

MORE: Recap the Premier League match with commentary, highlights, & more from Tottenham vs Chelsea

First half of Chelsea vs Tottenham features multiple VAR reviews

The game got off to a flying start as Dejan Kulusevski opened the scoring for Spurs, benefitting from a large deflection off Chelsea defender Levi Colwill which left Roberto Sanchez with no chance to make a save.

With both sides flying forward with electric attacking intent, the match got out of hand quickly.

Heung-Min Son goal disallowed for offside

The flood of VAR interventions came on a relatively innocuous decision where Heung-Min Son seemingly put Tottenham 2-0 up in the 14th minute, but on review the play appeared extremely tight. Ultimately, Son did look as if he was just an inch offside, and the goal was ruled out.

Destiny Udogie escapes red card for bad tackle

Tottenham were lucky to remain with 11 players in the 18th minute, as Destiny Udogie went in with a horrible two-footed tackle on Raheem Sterling out wide.

Udogie would see yellow initially from Michael Oliver, but there was a subsequent VAR check to review for a possible red card, and for good reason. Udogie's tackle was extremely dangerous, as he lunged in with a leg-breaker.

Ultimately, the Tottenham defender would escape without further punishment for one reason: he missed. Just like Kai Havertz of Arsenal earlier this weekend, who also remained on the pitch against Newcastle for a similar incident, Udogie's tackle would not reach the necessary threshold for a straight red as he did not make full contact with Sterling.

NBC commentator Jon Champion, who has real-time access to the VAR communication, said that the review ultimately determined the tackle was an ""upper-level yellow card"" that didn't quite meet the qualifications for a red.

Cristian Romero next to avoid straight red card despite review

Just four minutes later, another Tottenham defender would again get away with just a booking despite a VAR review for a possible red card.

Cristian Romero, often criticised for his reckless nature, had a kick-out at Levi Colwill in the 22nd minute behind the play while laying on the ground. He kicked Colwill right in the calf, but no action was taken.

This passage of play was not reviewed by VAR. It's unclear exactly why, but an assumption can be made that the VAR official was likely not aware of the incident until play had already restarted, at which point he cannot intervene. Those incidents have to be caught before play restarts, which is extremely difficult to do as the game continues to flow.

Raheem Sterling goal disallowed

Chelsea were the next to see a goal chalked off, as Raheem Sterling's 21st minute equaliser was nullified on review. The decision came as Sterling's initial effort, blocked by Pedro Porro, deflected straight back onto the arm of the Chelsea forward.

By rule, any contact by the ball with the arm or hand of an attacking player is an automatic foul, regardless of arm position, intent, or any other factor. Thus, the goal was disallowed.

Correct decision to rule out Sterling's goal? pic.twitter.com/VKnrNC0Y0K — Football Tweet ⚽ (@Football__Tweet) November 6, 2023

Cristian Romero sent off on VAR review, Chelsea awarded penalty

In what was easily the defining moment of the match, Chelsea were ultimately awarded a penalty after a wild passage of play in the 31st minute where they initially put the ball in the back of the net. The goal was ruled out, but a penalty was eventually given along with the first red card.

The ball pinged around the Tottenham penalty area wildly with Spurs unable to clear after blocking multiple efforts, until Moises Caicedo finally buried a long-distance effort with a low finish inside the left post. Despite initially appearing to count, the offside flag was raised extremely late, with the assistant referee determining, after a moment to think, that Nicolas Jackson was interfering with play from an offside position.

Yet that was just the beginning of the saga. With the goal disallowed, a VAR review began for a penalty as Cristian Romero swung wildly into the shins of Raheem Sterling. While he got the ball with his tackle, he followed through with extreme force straight onto both of Sterling's legs, and referee Michael Oliver was sent to the monitor.

After a few looks, Oliver produced a straight red card for Romero's tackle and awarded Chelsea a penalty, which Cole Palmer dispatched to even the scoreline at 1-1.

Nicolas Jackson goal disallowed for offside

Chelsea would see a third goal of the half disallowed as Nicolas Jackson put the ball in the net on 37 minutes but Raheem Sterling was offside in the buildup just past the midfield stripe. There's very little argument to be had here, and the game played on.

While it was a decision that featured little, if any, controversy, it added to the mayhem of the half and contributed to the game's overall narrative.

Reece James avoids red card despite elbow to Destiny Udogie

While two Tottenham defenders escaped an early shower earlier in the match for incidents that could have potentially seen them off, Chelsea also had a player avoid further punishment just before halftime.

Reece James caught Destiny Udogie in the face with a trailing elbow while challenging for a bouncing ball in the air. Referees have been strict with incidents such as these, and it was surprising to see James get away with just a yellow card.

sports,Nick Brinkerhoff,2023-12-18T22:47:00+00:00,"The Seahawks are just about hanging on by a thread. At 6-7, the team is on the outside looking in when it comes to the playoff picture. A win on Monday night against the suddenly reeling Eagles could be a big boost in their chances going forward -- a matchup that is actually a pretty good one after looking beneath the surface. The Eagles come in as losers of two straight, losing in blowout fashion both times no less. Suddenly the sky is falling as the Cowboys have taken over the NFC East division lead, complicating matters as the regular season winds down. The sense of urgency for both sides means we are looking at two teams with plenty to lose, setting up for a fun Monday night under the lights at Lumen Field.

Before we get into our lineup and strategy, here are the key scoring settings for DraftKings Showdown contests: They're full-point PPR and there are three-point bonuses for 300 passing yards, 100 rushing yards, and 100 receiving yards. The Captain pick costs 1.5 times a player's original price, but he also gets his point total multiplied by 1.5.

Eagles-Seahawks DraftKings Picks: DFS lineup for Week 15 Monday Night Football

$50,000 budget, need at least one player from each team.

Captain (1.5x points, 1.5x salary): WR DK Metcalf, Seahawks ($14,400)

The Eagles secondary issues are well-documented at this stage and they'll be made even worse with the absence of CB Darius Slay (knee) in Seattle on Monday night. Metcalf has four touchdowns in his last two games, including a three TD game against a stout Cowboys defense. The receiver has been prone to being undisciplined on the field, however, resulting in an ejection against the 49ers last week. That is always a concern when trusting Metcalf, but we take the good with the bad since the ceiling is so high. No matter who ends up starting at QB, the WR is in line for another dominant showing against one of the league's most generous secondaries.

FLEX QB Geno Smith, Seahawks ($9,400)

Metcalf won't be throwing the ball to himself and he's not one to get opportunities in the running game, meaning that someone will be setting him up for success. And since Smith appears ready to play, he finds himself with a spot in our lineup. In the event that he doesn't play, however, we will turn to Drew Lock ($9,200) in his place. Regardless, the Seattle quarterbacks are set up for success and should be able to light up the skies on Monday night. Take the chance to stack QB1 and WR1 from the home side.

FLEX WR DeVonta Smith, Eagles ($9,000)

Most of the attention will continue to be focused on A.J. Brown, but what about the reliable Smith? He's quietly been the more productive option over the last three weeks, totaling 62.5 fantasy points to just 54.5 from Brown. Seattle's secondary was torched by San Francisco last week, allowing both Brandon Aiyuk and Deebo Samuel to go over the century mark. And for all the credit that the Eagles get for having a great team, they are a fairly top-heavy bunch. There's no clear WR3 behind Brown and Smith, meaning the opportunities will be aplenty. Expect that big workload to continue for a receiver that's sometimes forgotten in Philly.

FLEX RB D'Andre Swift, Eagles ($8,000)

The message to the Eagles has been clear from the fans -- run the ball. It's part of what made this team so hard to beat earlier in the season. They've become a pass-happy offense in recent history, relying mostly on the legs and arm of Jalen Hurts to do everything. After getting smacked by the Cowboys last week, the Eagles weren't afforded the opportunity to establish the run. That will be a point of emphasis this time around, especially since Hurts is dealing with an illness. It's been three weeks since Swift had any kind of impact. That needs to change if the Eagles want to get back on track.

FLEX TE Dallas Goedert, Eagles ($6,200)

One of the players that should help this team get-right is Goedert. The TE is healthy once again, having returned against the Cowboys last week and settled in nicely by collecting all four targets for 30 yards. We mentioned earlier the lack of a true WR3 for Philly, but that is essentially Goedert's role with the lack of WR depth. As a trusted option in the passing game, Goedert should find success against a defense that's been shredded by TEs in back-to-back weeks.

FLEX TE Noah Fant, Seahawks ($2,600)

Fant rounds out the lineup as a fine sleeper option against a defense that's struggled to contain TEs at times throughout this season. He likely needs a touchdown to make a real impact, but we can pencil in Fant for around four targets in an offense that seemingly loves to throw touchdowns to random TEs. Considering the state of our budget at this point, we're taking a shot on Fant to deliver as a short-yardage option with the Eagles' pass rush threatening to make life difficult.

sports,Vinnie Iyer,2023-11-30T21:31:00+00:00,"When the Seahawks and Cowboys meet in Dallas on ""Thursday Night Football"" to open NFL Week 13 (8:15 p.m. ET, Amazon Prime Video), it will be a prime-time matchup featuring two potential playoff teams and plenty of key fantasy football start 'em, sit 'em question marks.

With a game total of 47.5 and the Cowboys favored by three field goals, it may be another rout for the home team against a weaker opponent. Dallas has some red-hot fantasy assets, while Seattle's struggling offensive skill players might be best suited for fantasy benches.

Here's looking at who to start in seasonal leagues and DFS lineups from the latest edition of TNF:

MORE THURSDAY NIGHT FOOTBALL:

DK lineup | FD lineup | ATS pick | Best props

Seahawks: Who to start, sit in fantasy football on TNF

Sit: QB Geno Smith

Smith has dropped from the top 12 last season to cumulative QB20 in 2023. He's had two great starts and three so-so ones, but the rest has been forgettable. The Cowboys have allowed only two strong fantasy performances by quarterbacks, (Brock Purdy and Jalen Hurts), and we don't expect Smith to make it three.

Sit: RB Zach Charbonnet

There was a black fly in the Charbonnet against the 49ers last week. This is the good advice that you should take: Be wary of anyone who's rushed for just 47 yards two straight weeks despite getting significant duty with Kenneth Walker III (oblique) on the shelf. Charbonnet's also not doing much in the passing game, and this is as bad of a matchup as San Francisco was last week. You should do better, even in a big bye.

WEEK 13 FANTASY ADVICE:

Sleepers | Busts | Projections | Start-sit

Start: WR DK Metcalf

Metcalf can flash big plays and stay involved in games...until he disappears when Smith can't get the ball to him. Smith might be judicious about throwing his way with second-year corner sensation DaRon Bland in coverage. That said, you simply can't sit DeKaylin Zacharius against anyone because of his big-game ability. Again, you can't expect more than WR3 production, which is where his overall scoring has been in 2023.

Start: WR Tyler Lockett

While Metcalf is WR34 in terms of total points this season in half-point PPR, Lockett is only two notches higher at WR32. They finished as WR13 and WR18, respectively, last season, so it's a big dropoff. Lockett also has a decent matchup vs. Stephon Gilmore. He, like Metcalf, remains a volume-based WR3.

WEEK 13 PPR RANKINGS:

QBs | RBs | WRs | TEs | D/STs | Kickers

Sit: WR Jaxon Smith-Njigba

Smith-Njigba can be a bit interesting if you are desperate in a deeper league because he has the matchup on par with the other two wideouts vs. Jourdan Lewis. JSN can mirror some of the production Curtis Samuel gave the Commanders last week in Dallas, but forget 100 yards. Around 50 yards seems like the ceiling with a big boost from garbage time.

Sit: TEs Noah Fant and Will Dissly

Noah Gray is a better fantasy player than Noah Fant this season. Will Dissly is barely a better fantasy player than Will Mallory this season.

WEEK 13 STANDARD RANKINGS:

QBs | RBs | WRs | TEs | D/STs | Kickers

Sit: Seahawks D/ST

The Seahawks are getting better defensively against the pass, but that's not enough to trust them here, as they're getting gashed on the ground, too.

Sit: K Jason Myers

This is actually not a good spot for one of the most reliable fantasy kickers, given the Cowboys don't give up many field-goal attempts.

WEEK 13 DFS:

DK lineup | FD lineup | Best stacks | Best values

Cowboys: Who to start, sit in fantasy football on TNF

Start: QB Dak Prescott

Guess the only two quarterbacks who have been better than Rayne Dakota in fantasy this season? Yep, after his sizzling seven-game stretch, Prescott has ascended behind just Josh Allen and Jalen Hurts. The Seahawks haven't given up many big games to QBs, but you need to keep rolling with Dak on his heater, especially at home. One can't be surprised, however, if it's more of a 250-and-2 kind of night.

Start: RB Tony Pollard | Sit: RB Rico Dowdle

Pollard and the Cowboys' defense is a reason why Prescott may not need to go nuts passing. The Seahawks have now joined the bottom five teams in giving up fantasy points to running backs. Pollard has come on the past two weeks against the Panthers and Commanders after sliding into RB2 range. Pollard scoots to something like 80 and a score. Dowdle is a stretch to get mop-up production, however,

Start: WR CeeDee Lamb

Lamb can eat again in the slot against Jamal Adams, as he avoids the Seahawks' better cornerbacks on the outside. Again, don't expect a massive game because the running game, defense, and special teams will have plenty of success in another big victory.

Sit: WR Brandin Cooks

Cooks is the one Cowboy to fade this week vs. rookie Devon Witherspoon, who's quickly emerging as the Seahawks' best corner. The nature of the zone defense is to limit big plays. Plus, between Lamb, Pollard, the tight ends, and younger receivers, Cooks won't be needed much.

Start: TE Jake Ferguson

Ferguson has slumped the past two weeks, catching a combined four-of-eight targets for 67 yards and no TDs against the Commanders and Panthers. He should be more active here working the middle of the field, as the Seahawks' TE defense is a bit inflated by the numbers. This is definitely set up to be more of a Ferguson game than a Cooks game.

Start: Cowboys D/ST

They are once again the top-scoring fantasy defense thanks to six massive outings, including the past two games. Dallas will get it done vs. Geno.

Start: K Brandon Aubrey

Aubrey has been elite as a rookie with his field-goal production. He should be good for a couple of field goals to complement the Cowboys' touchdowns.

FLEX: Seahawks WR Tyler Lockett $7,200

FLEX: Cowboys TE Jake Ferguson $6,200

FLEX: Cowboys D/ST $5,600

FLEX: Seahawks WR Jaxon Smith-Njigba $5,200

Based on the analysis, it's fine to invest plenty in the Cowboys' running and intermediate passing games. Pollard would be a good correlated stack with the Cowboys' defense. Here's hoping that Lockett and JSN will be the busiest Seahawks in second-half catchup mode.

This construction maxes out the salary on FD and is very similar to the DK philosophy of focusing on Pollard, this time not stacking with the defense.","Seahawks-Cowboys Fantasy Start 'Em Sit 'Em Week 13: Should you start Zach Charbonnet, Jake Ferguson on TNF?",https://www.sportingnews.com/us/fantasy/news/seahawks-cowboys-fantasy-start-em-sit-em-week-13-tnf/9c0c60600362f319a1c24670,Sporting News
sports,Joel Sritharan,2023-09-30T21:27:02+00:00,"Referees once again took the headlines on the opening matchday of the 2023/24 Premier League season following an incorrect VAR decision in Manchester United's fixture against Wolves.

Gary O'Neil's side were denied a late penalty after a foul from Andre Onana on Sasa Kalajdzic. Despite a long VAR check, Wolves were not given the spot-kick in injury time and lost the match 1-0.

Fans watching the game were in disbelief when the call was made, and similar incidents have happened since, including against United. Bruno Fernandes said he would wait for an apology — one that never arrived — after Cristian Romero was not punished for handball in the Red Devils' 2-0 loss to Tottenham, and plenty of onlookers debated the penalty won by Marcus Rashford in United's subsequent comeback win at home to Nottingham Forest.

The Professional Game Match Officials Limited (PGMOL), the body responsible for referees in English football, has apologised on multiple occasions for mistakes made during matches. Here is an updated list of the incidents.

Every PGMOL apology for referee mistakes

Here are all the apologies carried out by the PGMOL for wrong decisions later accepted to have been wrong.

Tottenham 2-1 Liverpool: September 30, 2023

Liverpool had their hearts broken as Joel Matip's stoppage-time own-goal gave Tottenham a 2-1 victory. The Reds, down to nine men after a red card to Curtis Jones and two bookings for Diogo Jota, were looking to hang on at the death, and nearly did so until the cruel finish.

However, the game could have turned out completely different had the VAR booth not committed a ""serious human error"" earlier in the match. Soon after Jones was sent off in the first half, Luis Diaz scored to put Liverpool 1-0 up despite their disadvantage, but the flag went up for offside. Replay seemed to show that Diaz was onside, but VAR Darren England ended his check without even drawing lines, and the decision stood.

The PGMOL issued a statement after the match stating the goal should have stood.

Manchester United 1-0 Wolves: August 14, 2023

After Onana clattered into Kalajdzic in the box, O'Neil thought a penalty would certainly be awarded. Instead, the Wolves manager received a yellow card on the sidelines for his protests.

PGMOL's Jonathan Moss did apologise for the mistake after the match, which O'Neil said he appreciated.

Tottenham 2-1 Brighton: April 8, 2023

Chief Refereeing Officer Howard Webb had to give to Brighton an apology after they were denied a penalty in their away trip to Tottenham. It was one of many decisions the Seagulls were not happy about.

Arsenal 1-1 Brentford: February 11, 2023

Arsenal were denied two points in their race for the title after VAR's Lee Mason did not use the right player when checking for an offside in Brentford's goal.

Mikel Arteta was not happy after the game. He said: ""That wasn't a human error. That was a big, big, big not conceiving and understanding your job.""

Crystal Palace 1-1 Brighton: February 11, 2023

Incredibly, the referees made another wrong offside decision on the same day.

John Brooks was taken off VAR duty for two games after he drew the offside line in the wrong place, denying Brighton's Pervis Estupinan a goal.

Aston Villa 3-1 Manchester United: November 6, 2022

Lucas Digne's free-kick was one of the highlights in Aston Villa's victory over Man United, but a post-match review showed he received additional help following a mistake from the referee.

The Red Devils' wall was set more than 10 yards behind the ball, allowing Digne more room to find the back of the net.

Nottingham Forest 2-2 Brentford: November 5, 2022

Brentford were awarded a penalty after a collision between Dean Henderson and Yoane Wissa. Replays showed that Wissa initiated the contact, but Brentford were still given the spot-kick.

This forced Webb to apologise to Forest after the match.

Fulham 3-0 Aston Villa: October 20, 2022

Douglas Luiz was wrongly sent off for Aston Villa just after the hour mark. He was thought to have instigated a bust-up, when the real perpetrator was in fact Aleksandar Mitrovic.

Manchester United 3-1 Arsenal: September 4, 2022

Arsenal's first defeat of the season came at Old Trafford, but a refereeing decision impacted the match early on.

Gabriel Martinelli was denied a goal after a VAR check decided Martin Odegaard had fouled Christian Eriksen. PGMOL later revealed that the goal should have stood.

Newcastle 0-0 Crystal Palace: September 3, 2022

Crystal Palace were let off the hook when Tyrick Mitchell's own goal was ruled out after Joe Willock was thought to have impeded Vicente Guaita between the sticks.

It turned out to be the wrong decision, despite a lengthy check in the VAR hub.

Chelsea 2-1 West Ham: September 3, 2022

Maxwell Cornet thought he scored late on against Chelsea to make it 2-2, but the referee disallowed the goal due to a foul on Edouard Mendy by Jarrod Bowen in the build-up.

Webb apologised to David Moyes after the incident.

Crystal Palace 3-1 Aston Villa: August 20, 2022

Webb's first apology in his new role came during Villa's defeat at Selhurst Park. Andy Madley awarded Palace a penalty following a check on the VAR monitor.

The decision, which went against Digne, was the wrong call.

Everton 0-1 Manchester City: February 26, 2022

Man City were given a helping hand in their title race against Liverpool after Everton were denied a penalty in the second half.

sports,The New York Times,2023-11-17T21:47:19+00:00,"Erling Haaland is just six away from Norway’s goalscoring record, so it is surely inevitable that he will soon be his nation’s most prolific striker ever.

On one hand, that will have happened remarkably quickly – Haaland only scored his first goals for Norway in 2020. On the other, this has been an incredibly long time coming.

GO DEEPER What is Haaland really like?

Of the 213 FIFA-affiliated nations, Norway’s is the longest-standing outright individual goalscoring record in the world. It was set by Jorgen Juve, a fascinating figure who ended his international career in 1937 and later became a renowned sports journalist in his home country.

Advertisement

Juve scored a relatively modest 33 goals in 45 matches for Norway, including five hat-tricks, although his tally is made remarkable by the fact he played as a centre-forward in less than half of those games. He was otherwise positioned in defence, from where he captained his nation to the bronze medal at the 1936 Olympics. That explains why his final international goal came three years before his final cap, in June 1934. Therefore, it is likely that by the time Haaland scores six more goals, it will be around 90 years since Juve reached the 33-goal mark.

There is technically one other record that stands for longer, also in Scandinavia.

Poul “Tist” Nielsen scored 52 goals in 38 games for Denmark between 1910 and 1925, although his record was equalled by Jon Dahl Tomasson — now manager of Blackburn Rovers in the English Championship — in 2010. Tomasson elected to retire from international football after that year’s World Cup in South Africa rather than seeking to make the record his own. Nielsen’s name therefore remains in the record books, although he now holds Denmark’s record only jointly.

This graph demonstrates the extent to which these records are outliers.

Only six countries’ goalscoring records have stood for more than 50 years, including Libya, Sudan and Guinea. Therefore, if we only include nations to have qualified for the World Cup, it is only Denmark, Norway and Hungary whose records have lasted more than half a century.

Hungary’s record is perhaps the most impressive, considering Ferenc Puskas scored 84 goals in just 85 games, and his international career was brought to a premature end at the age of 29 because of the Hungarian Revolution. He later represented Spain at the 1962 World Cup, having gone half a decade without playing international football.

The most striking thing about the graph is how many goalscoring records have been set recently.

Advertisement

Sixty-four of the 211 nations’ record goalscorers have appeared for them in 2023, and in terms of time since they were set, the median goalscoring mark has stood for just seven years, which includes the likes of the Republic of Ireland’s Robbie Keane and Paraguay’s Roque Santa Cruz. Increased longevity due to superior fitness levels in the modern game is clearly a major factor, as is the number of relatively new nations on the FIFA list.

Perhaps the most surprising international goalscoring record is that of Italy.

Giga Riva’s relatively insubstantial haul of 35 goals has been the mark to beat since World Cup 1974. Not only has it not been matched or eclipsed, but no one has ever got particularly near it — Roberto Baggio and Alessandro Del Piero both reached 27 and that’s as close as anyone has come.

For context, four Englishmen have reached 35 goals in that period — Gary Lineker, Michael Owen, Wayne Rooney and Harry Kane. Four Spaniards too — Raul Gonzalez, Fernando Torres, David Villa and David Silva, while Alvaro Morata (on 34) should get there shortly.

Furthermore, no current Italians seem set to challenge it — Ciro Immobile (with 17) has less than half that tally, turns 34 years old in February, and has been omitted from recent squads. Nobody in Luciano Spalletti’s current squad has scored more than eight international goals.

Italy’s shortcoming clearly isn’t about a complete lack of prolific strikers — the likes of Christian Vieri, Pippo Inzaghi and Luca Toni all scored heavily at club level. Sometimes it’s been the opposite, with various strikers competing for a starting place, meaning none of them got to dominate the national side for a decade. That said, around a decade ago, there was simply a dearth of prolific Italian strikers to choose from. Antonio Conte used Eder and Graziano Pelle up front at the 2016 European Championship.

There are also tactical considerations. Not only have Italy traditionally been the most defensive of the major European nations, but their attacking play has generally been based around using a second striker. Baggio, Del Piero and Francesco Totti have all been the golden boy at various — overlapping — stages, with Italy’s No 9 often selected primarily to bring the best out of Italy’s No 10.

What of Norway? They, similarly, were traditionally a defensive-minded side, favouring counter-attacks and long balls. At their peak under Egil Olsen in the mid-1990s, they often used a striker out of position on the wing, where he would challenge for long, diagonal balls.

Norway’s Jostein Flo, a giant striker often utilised on the right flank, at the 1994 World Cup (Chris Cole/Allsport)

But perhaps the more pertinent thing about Norway is that, historically, they generally haven’t been very competitive.

They’ve only ever qualified for four major tournaments — in 1938, 1994, 1998 and 2000 — and have won a combined three matches in those appearances. They’re also similar to Italy in that, at times, they’ve boasted various high-level strikers whose careers roughly overlapped — John Carew, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, Tore Andre Flo, Steffen Iversen — and at other points have suffered a complete lack of good centre-forwards.

At this point in time, Norway appear to have the most prolific striker in Europe, and it’s not unreasonable to consider where Haaland might end up in the all-time international goalscoring charts worldwide, never mind just in relation to his compatriots.

Haaland is currently averaging nearly a goal a game for his country, which will inevitably be difficult for the 23-year-old to sustain over his career. But it’s worth pointing out how impressive that is, even at this early stage. Again, excluding countries who have never qualified for a World Cup, only the aforementioned quartet of Juve, Riva, Puskas and Nielsen, plus Japan’s Kunishige Kamamoto, hold their nation’s international goalscoring records and also boast a rate of 0.75 goals per game or more.

Even Cristiano Ronaldo, the most prolific international goalscorer of all time with 127 for Portugal, boasts ‘only’ 0.63 goals per game, a lower rate than the likes of Romelu Lukaku (Belgium), Kane and Aleksandar Mitrovic (Serbia), which owes to his early days as a winger rather than a central striker.

Considering how many hat-tricks Haaland scores for Manchester City, it’s not beyond the realms of possibility that he could score six goals during this international break to move level with Juve, particularly given Norway’s first fixture is a home friendly against the Faroe Islands today (Thursday), before a European Championship qualifier against Scotland in Glasgow on Sunday. That said, the Faroes’ defence is less leaky than you might expect — only twice in their last 22 outings have they conceded more than three times in a game.

The wider question is whether we will ever see Haaland at a major tournament.

Despite the presence of him and Arsenal captain Martin Odegaard, Norway have failed to qualify from their Euro 2024 qualification group directly, with Spain and Scotland already securing the top two spots.

They are, at least, likely to qualify for the play-offs, and therefore will have two must-win games in March to secure their first major tournament appearance since 2000 — the summer when Haaland was born. But there’s been little in recent performances to think Norway will breeze through those play-offs.

Juve’s individual record will soon be surpassed, but captaining his side to a bronze medal at the Olympics may stand as his nation’s greatest achievement for much longer.

GO DEEPER Erling Haaland is phenomenal - so why hasn’t he made Manchester City better?

sports,The Roar,2023-10-19T21:03:08+00:00,"Gun import Jordon Crawford has exploded late to lead the Tasmania JackJumpers to a club-record score in a 105-95 NBL road win over the defending champion Sydney Kings.

The American guard opened the final period at Qudos Bank Arena on Sunday with four consecutive three-pointers and scored all of his team’s points on a stunning 14-2 run.

It gave the JackJumpers a game-high 19-point lead and just about put the result to bed after Sydney had lost Jaylin Galloway (shoulder) and Jonah Bolden (fouled out).

The Kings never gave up but could not close the gap as Crawford finished with a game-high 32 points.

Fellow import Milton Doyle and Majok Deng each scored 17 for Tasmania, who recorded their second win over Sydney in as many attempts this season.

“I had a couple of opportunities where I’m open and I shot the ball,” Crawford said. “Marcus (Lee) and Majok were setting great screens and in order for me to get those shots, them guys have to get me open.

“They did a hell of a job in doing that and it was a team effort. The ball was hot, the ball was moving and everybody contributed today.”

Sydney only had themselves to blame for the loss as they went 10-of-37 from three-point range.

Jaylen Adams (18 points, 10 rebounds) and Jordan Hunter (16, five) couldn’t lift the Kings over the line.

“Sometimes you just miss shots,” Kings coach Mahmoud Abdelfattah said.

“We’ve been practising these for the last two-and-a-half months, we got some great looks and at the end of the day that’s the difference.

“When you’re missing a ton of shots you’ve got to win the offensive rebounding battle and they beat us on that.”

Tasmania burst out to a double-figure lead when they piled on 36 points during the opening period, and the margin blew out to 18 before halftime.

Doyle (12 points), Deng and Jack McVeigh (both 10) all did plenty of damage on the scoreboard in the first half for the visitors, who never trailed. Galloway’s huge dunk sparked Sydney early in the third period and they cut the margin to three.

But he and Bolden soon exited and Crawford’s scintillating run gave the JackJumpers the upper hand. The Kings are hopeful Galloway will be fit for Saturday’s trip to take on the Cairns Taipans.

“The doctors may have other plans, but he’s doing alright,” Abdelfattah said. “Obviously he was out for the rest of the game and he’s in pain a little bit, but we’ll see.”

Goulding’s golden touch too much for Breakers

Veteran shooter Chris Goulding has fired a series of clutch three-pointers to pilot NBL ladder leaders Melbourne United to a 97-88 win over New Zealand.

Goulding had a quiet first half but drove daggers into the visitors at John Cain Arena on Sunday when he found range after the main break.

In his 300th game for Melbourne, Goulding delivered his trademark when he twice launched crucial bombs to help his team edge ahead in the dying stages of a tight contest.

Goulding’s fade-away from the corner gave United a game-high nine-point lead with three minutes left as he finished with 4-of-5 shooting from distance.

“We can’t not talk about CG’s couple of threes down the stretch,” coach Dean Vickerman told reporters post-game. “They were pretty incredible.”

Jo Lual-Acuil (16 points) and import Ian Clark (18) also came up with big plays in the final period as Melbourne outscored their opponents 33-25 with the game on the line.

Lual-Acuil shone in his second game back from a long-term wrist injury, and Clark’s wide-open three restored United’s nine-point buffer with 38 seconds left to play. Such was Goulding’s confidence in his teammate, he turned around to celebrate the game-sealing bucket with the home crowd before Clark had even released his shot.

Melbourne had five scorers in double figures in an even team performance in the absence of injured guard Matthew Dellavedova, who has missed two games because of his latest concussion setback.

The result was Melbourne’s ninth consecutive home win over New Zealand and gave them a 6-1 record for the season.

The Breakers (1-2) led by six points midway through the third period but ran out of steam in a tough loss that ended a gruelling road trip, which included two exhibition matches against NBA opposition in the United States.

Advertisement

Zylan Cheatham (30 points) and Parker Jackson-Cartwright (18) threatened to drive the Breakers to a rousing victory until the guard fouled out inside the last four minutes.

Former NBA forward Anthony Lamb had 15 points and five rebounds on his NBL debut for New Zealand after signing as a replacement for injured import Justinian Jessup.

But Breakers coach Mody Maor was in no mood to look for positives in his team’s performance.

“We have very high standards for how we want to play and this isn’t it,” Maor said. “Lack of focus, missing key players, making mistakes on covers.

“I don’t care where we flew from, what our schedule is, what happened the day before – I care zero. This isn’t the level of execution that we expect from ourselves.”

Shea Ili (16 points, four assists) was important for Melbourne and Luke Travers finished with 16 points, including 15 in the first half.

Sixers, Phoenix continue to rise

The Adelaide 36ers have told each other some hard truths before responding in style to heap more pressure on the Perth Wildcats with their 89-78 victory.

In the other NBL match on Saturday, South East Melbourne Phoenix made it three straight wins, beating the Bullets 96-73 as Alan Williams led the way against a side looking lost without the suspended Aron Baynes.

In Adelaide, the 36ers responded to a disappointing loss on Thursday night, also at home to the Phoenix, and handed the Wildcats a third straight defeat with their 11-point win.

Sitting in bottom spot with one win from five games coming into the macth, the players got together to draw a line in the sand.

It certainly worked and their effort, energy and desperation was dramatically improved against Perth, but so was the execution and a focus on getting Isaac Humphries more involved inside.

He put up 26 points and eight rebounds in a match-winning performance but the shortening of the rotation to use just eight players from coach CJ Bruton worked too.

“We met as a playing group yesterday and talked through a lot of stuff,” Humphries said.

“We just wanted to come out today and put into action everything we talked about.

“We executed what the coaches needed from us tonight and we executed what we, as a playing group, wanted to execute as well.”

A third straight defeat for the Wildcats has them struggling at 2-4 this season.

Coach John Rillie is focused know they aren’t playing well and the improvement needs to start offensively.

“We’re not playing good basketball at this point in time,” Rillie said.

“An area we need to improve on is our offence. That’s where we have to find some type of rhythm and we’ve yet to do that in these last couple of games.

Advertisement

“The game’s played at both ends and you need to find a rhythm to generate some natural enthusiasm, and we haven’t been able to do that for good stretches.”

Brisbane coach Justin Schueller always knew losing his superstar centre Baynes with a five-game suspension was going to be challenging, but that was magnified on Saturday night.

Williams produced 21 points and six rebounds for South East Melbourne but Brisbane will still be without Baynes for next weekend’s double-header away to Perth and at home to Tasmania, and he needs to find some answers.

“We’ve got to have solutions right now for two more games without Banger (Baynes) and that’s the thing that’s sitting right in the front of my head, but scoring 73 points isn’t enough to get it done in this league,” Schueller said.

“Then giving them 96 is way too many as well so we have a lot of stuff that we still have to work on.”

JLA return lifts United to win in Wollongong

Melbourne United have celebrated the long-awaited return of Jo Lual-Acuil but it was fellow centre Ariel Hukporti who starred in a 101-91 defeat of the lllawarra Hawks.

NBL heavyweights United only kicked clear from last season’s wooden spooners towards the end of the third quarter following a high-scoring first half at WIN Entertainment Centre on Friday.

Again sloppy from the field, the Hawks missed nine consecutive shots to finish the third period as United (5-1) opened up a 14-point lead that proved match-winning.

“We just have these patches against really good basketball teams that let us down,” said Hawks coach Jacob Jackomas.

“The shots weren’t disgusting today, just some little things right now. We said that before with the team is that we need to do all the little things right against this basketball team and we didn’t.”

Big man Gary Clark (17 points) was one of few Hawks who got his eye in, with imports Tyler Harvey (19 points, six from 16 attempts) and Justin Robinson (nine points, two from eight) again struggling.

Robinson was one of three Hawks to foul out, alongside big men Sam Froling and Lachlan Olbrich.

Despite Illawarra’s shooting issues, United gave up more first half points (51) than in any other of their games this season.

The Hawks dominated the offensive glass (18-10) and punished United with 21 points from turnovers.

But they finished the day shooting at 38 per cent from the field to United’s 53, which made things difficult, especially when United locked the paint down in the third quarter.

“It took us a little bit of time to wake up with their physicality and the way they got after it,” said United coach Dean Vickerman.

NBL champion Lual-Acuil returned from a wrist injury for the first minutes of his United comeback, while NBA hopeful Hukporti (21 points, 10 rebounds) shone for the visitors.

Hukporti was United’s rock under the basket and a defensive board in the final minute sealed his third double-double from five games this season.

“I think I’ve found my role in the team now, it took me a while because I’m coming off the (achilles) injury and it was a year out,” Hukporti said.

That is vintage Tyler Harvey ????

“I’ve got it now, I know what my role is and I think I did a great job today.”

Lual-Acuil had a scratchy start, missing his first two free-throws and subbing out to change out of an incorrect pair of shorts, but went on to register 12 points on a minutes restriction.

“He’s going to see double-teams down there so once we get our spacing right and our cutting right to play off that, he’s going to be a weapon,” Vickerman said.

Projected NBA draft lottery pick AJ Johnson had his best Hawks game yet, but was again short on opportunities.

The teenager set the crowd alight with his first NBL three-pointer just after quarter time and sent a dime through traffic that led to a Gary Clark jam on transition soon afterwards.

Creek swamps Sixers for Phoenix

A powerful second quarter propelled South East Melbourne Phoenix to a clinical 102-85 NBL victory against the Adelaide 36ers at the Adelaide Entertainment Centre.

The Phoenix pummelled the Sixers 28-14 in the second term on Thursday night to put the game out of the home side’s reach.

Mitch Creek (23 points) led the Phoenix’s charge, import guards Gary Browne (19 points, eight assists) and Will Cummings (18 points) did as they pleased, while Alan Williams (15 points, 13 rebounds) was influential in his first game of the season following a knee injury.

“We were trading baskets until that second five minutes of the second quarter when the guys got multiple stops in a row and kept scoring freely,” Phoenix coach Mike Kelly said.

“That was the difference right there, that five-minute patch.”

Import Trey Kell (21 points) top-scored for Adelaide, while Dejan Vasiljevic, signed by the 36ers from the Sydney Kings only 48 hours earlier, had 17 points on debut with his new club.

Vasiljevic was prolific early, firing 10 attempts and scoring 10 points in the first quarter.

At the other end, Browne racked up nine points and four assists in the opening period, which ended with scores tied at 28-28.

Vasiljevic’s third triple gave Adelaide a slender 40-39 lead, before the visitors rattled off the next 15 points and led 54-42 at half-time.

After Browne led Phoenix’s early charge, it was fellow imports Williams and Cummings who, in the second stanza, troubled the Sixers, who looked all at sea offensively and passive defensively.

After Phoenix’s lead ballooned to 17 points midway through the third, experienced 36ers reserves Sunday Dech and Jason Cadee helped the home side briefly trim the deficit to single digits.

Advertisement

But their hard work was undone when Creek, who helped himself to 13 points for the term, drained an uncontested three on the three-quarter-time buzzer to push Phoenix out to 77-65, before Williams and Browne continued on their merry way in the fourth.

“Disappointing – that’s what that was,” Sixers coach CJ Bruton said.

“Our effort left, our communication left, and everyone was a step too slow.”

The Phoenix rose to 3-3 with their second straight win, while Adelaide (1-5) remain anchored to the bottom of the ladder.

CJ claims Kings didn’t look after DJ

Adelaide coach CJ Bruton has accused Sydney of not looking after Dejan Vasiljevic, as the war of words between the 36ers and Kings over the sharpshooting guard escalated.

Vasiljevic, a two-time championship winner with Sydney, had originally been released from his Kings contract to chase his NBA dream.

Advertisement

But when the Washington Wizards waived him just before pre-season training camp, the 26-year-old decided to return to the NBL – signing with the Sixers on Tuesday, which didn’t please Sydney’s powerbrokers.

“We originally amended the contract in good faith and completed our roster with the understanding that ‘DJ’ (Vasiljevic) would play internationally this season,” Kings chief executive Chris Pongrass said.

“We are disappointed with how this has been handled and another NBL team’s role in this process.”

Australian basketball legend and Kings co-owner Andrew Bogut chimed in on X where he posted, in part, that Sydney had granted Vasiljevic a release “after he told us he wanted to ‘chase his NBA dream’, not his NBL dream with another club”.

Vasiljevic, fronting the press as a 36er for the first time on Wednesday, fired back at the Kings, saying “they made me look like a villain, they made Adelaide look like the villain”.

But on Thursday night, Bruton called for Sydney to “move on”.

Advertisement

“I’ve only got my perspective – you (Kings) had the chance to have him, you chose not to have him,” he said.

“He’s moved on. Move on.

“If you wanted to do something more, look after the kid.

“Talk to him, championship ceremony or whatever … but that’s on them (Sydney).

“That’s not on us or me.”

Vasiljevic scored 17 points in his Adelaide debut on Thursday, including 11 in a productive first quarter, but he couldn’t prevent the bottom-placed Sixers from suffering a 102-85 loss to South East Melbourne Phoenix.

sports,Tony Harper,2023-10-16T22:37:26+00:00,"Wallabies coach Eddie Jones has again denied any contact with Japan and committed to staying in the job through to the next World Cup.

“That’s the intention, mate, but as you know, we play in a game where the coach doesn’t decide how long they stay,” he said at a media conference on Tuesday, adding he had a “100 percent” passion to continue coaching the Wallabies.

“I’m staying. I’ve always been committed to Australian rugby, want to leave it in a better place and that’s still the job. “

He was asked about his pre-tournament press conference where he attacked reporters’ negativity – “I probably need to give myself an uppercut, don’t I?” he joked.

Jones said he accepted that a review would be required into the World Cup flop, but his statement puts the ball firmly in Rugby Australia’s court as far as his future goes.

So far RA have said they intend backing Jones and he said he believed he had official support. He refused to answer a question on potential break clauses in his contract with RA.

On whether he will see out his contract through the end of 2027, Jones said: “It’s not absolutely my decision. “We’ve got a review going forward and let’s see what happens at the end of the review.

He said he was not worried about being sacked but accepted it was possible.

“I don’t control those sort of things. All I can do is coach. I went to the World Cup, came in for a short period of time and had to make a decision on the team, made the decision we needed to go with youth, and whilst the results in the World Cup weren’t the results we wanted, I think I’ve left the Australian team in a great position to go on to 2027.

“That judgment will be decided by the 2027 World Cup.”

He said the team – including coaches and players – have already completed their own review of the World Cup disaster. The next one would be “a formal review to be done by independent consultants” and he was ready to participate.

“I didn’t come back to Australia to have a holiday – sit down at Coogee Beach, eat fish and chips, have a nice flat white. It was always going to be a battle. When you’ve got a team that hasn’t done well for a long period of time, it’s always a battle.”

Jones said it was crucial that Rugby Australia got alignment in the code from grassroots through to the top team as it looks to rebuild it’s international standing. Australia, a two-time world champion, is currently ranked 10th in the world.

“You just got to watch the quarterfinals at the weekend. We’re not at that level. And we can’t pretend to be at that level. But can we be at that level by 2027? Yes, we can,” said Jones.

“We’re definitely off the pace but the opportunity to get better is there. I love the game. I love working with young players. I loved seeing some of the young players maturing during the World Cup and some of them struggle. And that’s all part of it. But I love the game and I love coaching the Wallabies.”

Jones was named Wallabies coach at the start of the year as replacement for Dave Rennie. He came in with grand statements that his team could win the Rugby Championship, Bledisloe Cup and make a smash and grab on the World Cup.

None of those targets were achieved and Jones changed his tune about building for the future when he named a young team for the doomed Cup campaign – where his team became the first Australians to bow out of a RWC in the pool stages.

He finished the year with a 2-7 win loss record – the only two victories coming against lowly Georgia and Portugal.

On Tuesday he said he no regrets with leaving experienced players such as Quade Cooper and Michael Hooper out of the side for the tournament.

“Everyone’s got their own judgment and they’re allowed to have that judgment,” he said. “My choice was that I decided to go with youth. And I stand by that because I think we’ve got a a lot of good young players who are really going to benefit from that experience at the World Cup, and going forward to the 2027 World Cup.”

It was reported during the campaign that Jones had an interview for the Japan head coach role but he denied that again on Tuesday, having previously also denied the story.

“I haven’t been speaking to anyone, mate,” was all Jones would say on multiple reports of conversations with sources in Japanese rugby.

He said he understood why Australian fans were hurting.

“We feel all the supporters hurt and really appreciate the great support we had in France and back in Australia for the team,” said Jones.

“Sometimes the change you have to have is uncomfortable. It is quite difficult. And sometimes you have to go through this to get into a better state and I believe that the problems we’ve had particularly at the national team will put us in a better state going forward.”

Jones clearly believes he is the right man to carry Australia on.

“I think I’ve got the foresight to see where we need to go. I’ve got the experience of being in difficult situations before,” Jones said.

“This is not an unusual situation. You’ve got a team that was struggling for a period of time, you’ve got underneath it a system that’s not supporting it and at some stage you bottom out.

“This is the opportunity now to change the team- as we’ve started with picking younger players with bright futures – and then we’ve got to look at the development system underneath as well.

“It’s not a simple equation that the Wallabies are bad. Let’s be serious about this. The Wallabies are not where they need to be but underneath that we need to fix the system to go forward. And if we can do that now we’ve got a rosy future.”

sports,Dan Treacy,2023-10-31T22:00:04+00:00,"The Rangers found themselves one strike away from a championship twice in 2011. They couldn't finish the job. On Wednesday night, they'll have a chance to avenge that painful finish.

Texas found out before Tuesday's Game 4 that slugger Adolis Garcia's season was over, but a talented lineup didn't miss a beat. The Rangers erupted for five runs in the second inning and five more in the third, bludgeoning Arizona's bullpen to take a 10-0 lead in the blink of an eye.

Corey Seager came through with his third home run of the series, while Marcus Semien drove in five of the Rangers' first 10 runs — including a three-run blast that put Texas up by double digits.

FAGAN: Three things Diamondbacks need to flip script on World Series

The Diamondbacks have earned a reputation for not backing down, and to their credit, they didn't. Arizona scored six runs over the final two innings, putting together competitive at-bats despite the dramatic deficit and forcing the Rangers to go to closer Jose Leclerc for the final out.

Still, it wasn't nearly enough. The Diamondbacks' best hope is that their late-game surge carries over to Game 5, where they will face elimination for the third time in this postseason.

The Rangers just need one more win to become World Series champions, and they will have the right man on the mound in Game 5 as Nathan Eovaldi makes his sixth start of the postseason. Zac Gallen, who was less than sharp in October but earned Cy Young consideration during the regular season, will start for the Diamondbacks with everything on the line for Arizona.

9:24 p.m. — Ryne Nelson strikes out Garver to open the fourth.

9:20 p.m. — Nathaniel Lowe makes the play to retire Carroll, and that will bring the Rangers back up to bat with a 10-0 lead.

8:53 p.m. — Thomas flies out to left to end the inning.

8:23 p.m. — Heim nabs Marte on the stolen base attempt! That'll end the inning. A quick momentum shift back to the Rangers after the leadoff Marte single.

sports,Vishakha Deshpande,2023-10-01T23:10:05+00:00,"The heart and soul of ICC Championships — the ODI Men's Cricket World Cup — will be held in India from October 5 to November 19.

Organised every four years by the International Cricket Council (ICC), the event is one of the most viewed sporting tournaments in the world.

Here we take a look at the history of the competition, and some of the landmark moments that have helped make the World Cup what it is today.

When was the first ODI Cricket Word Cup?

England hosted the inaugural ODI World Cup back in 1975, and held the event the following three times too.

Initially, the game was played in cricket whites and with a red ball instead of a white ball.

Eight teams were a part of that inaugural tournament — India, Pakistan, England, Australia, West Indies, New Zealand and a composite team from East Africa and Sri Lanka.

Current cricketing powerhouse South Africa was banned at the time from international sport due to its policy of racial segregation under the Apartheid system, and thus did not take part in the first ODI World Cup.

The West Indies won the first tournament and defended the title in the second World Cup in 1979, while India's first taste of glory came when they clinched the trophy in 1983 by defeating the West Indies by 43 runs in the final.

A 50-over ODI Cricket World Cup

The 1987 tournament saw two prime changes in the way the ODI World Cups were organised — a shift of venue from England to the Indian subcontinent, and games being played in 50 overs instead of 60.

The change in the number of overs was attributed to shorter daylight hours in Asia in comparison to England.

The 1987 tournament also had a new winner in Australia, who went on to defeat England by seven runs.

ODI World Cup kits, white ball introduction

Held in Australia and New Zealand, the 1992 World Cup saw a number of landmark moments.

That tournament was the first in which teams wore coloured kits, while it also saw the introduction of the white ball, changes in fielding rules, day/night matches and the inclusion of South Africa in the event for the first time following the end the Apartheid regime.

After a slow and disappointing start to their year, Pakistan made an historic comeback in the tournament to eventually win the trophy by defeating England in the final.

The 1999 World Cup and a three-year gap

The 1996 tournament was jointly hosted by India and Sri Lanka, and will go down in history as one of the most controversial episodes in the game.

Both the host teams met in the semi-finals at Eden Gardens, Kolkata. India's poor performance sparked an unruly crowd to protest against the home team and Sri Lanka was declared the winner by default, due to the halt in play.

Sri Lanka then went on to win the trophy that year, and they were back to try and defend it three years later in England, rather than the usual four-year cycle.

Following the 1996 event the ICC opted to try and revamp the schedule, with three years between events rather than four. But the move proved unpopular and 1999 was the only tournament to follow that pattern.

When was the last time India hosted the ODI Cricket World Cup?

The last time India welcomed the ODI Cricket World Cup was in 2011, when they were co-hosts with Sri Lanka and Bangladesh.

Pakistan were barred from hosting due to terrorist attacks on the Sri Lankan team when touring the country a couple of years prior to the World Cup.

The 2011 World Cup was a tournament of many firsts: Australia's streak of remaining unbeaten in 35 World Cup matches was broken when they were defeated by Pakistan. They hadn't lost a game since the 1999 tournament.

It was also the first time two Asian teams were in the finals, as India became the first country to win a World Cup at

home by defeating Sri Lanka in the decider.

After a prolonged drought of ICC trophies, India are favourites to bring the trophy home again this time in 2023.","When was the first Cricket World Cup?

sports,Dean Straka,2023-11-25T23:12:10+00:00,"Michigan State has hired Jonathan Smith as its next football coach, the school announced on Saturday. Smith, 44, has spent the past six seasons as coach at Oregon State where he's guided the Beavers to 18 wins over the past two seasons, including a 10-3 mark and No. 17 finish in the AP Top 25 during a 2022 campaign that earned him Pac-12 Coach of the Year honors.

Smith was among the initial pool of candidates linked to the Michigan State opening after the Spartans fired fourth-year coach Mel Tucker with cause midseason amid sexual harassment allegations. Smith later emerged as the leading candidate to replace Tucker during the final week of the regular season, which saw Oregon State suffer a 31-7 loss at rival Oregon.

""Jonathan has a proven track record of success, building the Oregon State program from the ground up by implementing a plan resulting in sustained historic success for the Beavers,"" said Michigan State athletic director Alan Haller in announcing the hire. ""He's been a part of championship staffs, coached in the College Football Playoff, and understands what's required to be successful at the highest level, learning from some of the game's most successful coaches.

""On the field, his teams are tough and physical, yet innovative. This year, Oregon State has controlled the line of scrimmage on both sides of the ball, ranking among the nation's leaders in both rushing offense and rushing defense. He's shown not only the ability to recruit talented student-athletes who fit his system, but also to develop and maximize players once they're in the program.""

Smith, a former quarterback for the Beavers from 1998-2001, exits Oregon State with a 34-35 overall mark as coach, including a 1-1 record in bowl games, as he now joins the Big Ten coaching ranks.

""As I start this next chapter of my coaching career, I want to first thank all the players, coaches and colleagues I have worked with the last six years,"" Smith said in a statement posted to social media. ""I will cherish the memories and friendships. I also want to express my deepest gratitude to the people of OSU/Corvallis for your support. When I first arrived as a freshman college student, I had no idea the opportunities and relationships this community would provide for me and my family. The collective impact you have made makes it impossible to thank everyone individually, but I am forever grateful.""

Oregon State left in dust amid uncertain future

Although Smith narrowly finished below. 500 in six seasons at the helm in Corvallis, Oregon, the Beavers made clear progress during the back half of his tenure. Smith guided Oregon State to seven victories in 2021 after the program went 9-22 during his first three years. The 2022 season, which marked the Beavers' first 10-win season since 2006 and highest AP Top 25 finish since 2000, resulted in a contract extension for Smith through February 2029 that bumped his annual salary to $4.85 million. Oregon State then started the 2023 season 8-2 before dropping back-to-back games against Washington and Oregon.

Earlier in the week, Oregon State athletic director Scott Barnes called it the ""No. 1 priority"" to reach a contract extension with Smith as speculation of this move began to grow. In a statement Saturday after Smith's departure was finalized, Barnes thanked him for his efforts at Oregon State as the Beavers now embark on the search for Smith's replacement.

""Coach Smith and his staff worked tirelessly to rebuild the culture at Oregon State, both on the field and in the classroom,"" Barnes said. ""All of Beaver Nation should thank him for the lasting legacy he has left to his alma mater and wish him and his family nothing but the best moving forward.""

Smith held multiple assistant jobs from 2002-17 before returning to his alma mater as coach in 2018. Smith spent six seasons as an assistant under former college football coach Chris Petersen, first as Boise State's quarterbacks coach from 2012-13 and then as Washington's quarterbacks coach and offensive coordinator from 2014-17. His time in Seattle included a Pac-12 title and College Football Playoff berth for Washington during the 2016 season.

Smith's exit from Oregon State comes at a point where the Beavers face much uncertainty as the Pac-12 prepares to lose 10 of its 12 members ahead of the 2024 season. Oregon State and Washington State are the only schools in the conference that have not been picked up by other power leagues. Four Pac-12 members -- USC, UCLA, Washington and Oregon -- will join Smith in the Big Ten next fall.

Can Smith turn the Michigan State program around?

The task now for Smith is revitalizing a Michigan State program that has struggled to field consistent success in recent seasons. After winning 10 or more games six times in a span of eight seasons under former coach Mark Dantonio from 2010-17, the Spartans have only won more than seven games in a season once since then, finishing 11-2 under Tucker's second year at the helm in 2021.

What seemed to be a breakthrough season for Tucker in 2021 earned him a 10-year contract extension worth $95 million, but Tucker's remaining tenure in East Lansing was all downhill afterwards. Michigan State regressed to 5-7 in 2022 before allegations of sexual harassment surrounding Tucker against rape survivor and activist Brenda Tracy emerged just two games into the 2023 season. Tucker was promptly suspended before the school fired him with cause several weeks later. The Spartans went on to finish 4-8 with assistant Harlon Barnett serving as interim coach the rest of the way, ending the season with a 42-0 loss to Penn State on Friday.

While Michigan State has found itself playing in a stacked Big Ten East division for roughly the last decade -- Michigan, Ohio State and Penn State have all been annual opponents -- that will change in Smith's debut season as the Big Ten expands and does away with divisions. Smith will also get the chance to face some familiar opponents from his time at Oregon State given that four Pac-12 schools are joining the conference. As far as the 2024 season is concerned on that front, Michigan State still faces Ohio State and Michigan (the Wolverines are a protected rival) but avoids Penn State. Oregon is the only newcomer it will face next fall, with the Spartans set to travel to Eugene, Oregon, in early October.",Michigan State hires Jonathan Smith: Oregon State coach leaves alma mater to take over Spartans job,https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/news/michigan-state-hires-jonathan-smith-oregon-state-coach-leaves-alma-mater-to-take-over-spartans-job/,CBSSports.com
sports,Luke McLaughlin at OL Stadium,2023-10-06T21:06:37+00:00,"Et voilà. France are through to the quarter-finals after the tournament’s latest mismatch against a demoralised Italy. The unthinkable outcome – a pool-stage exit for Fabien Galthié’s side – had remained a possibility, but was never on the cards from the moment Damian Penaud scored the first of eight French tries in the second minute. France have beaten Italy 14 times consecutively, a run stretching back to 2014.

If the predatory Penaud’s progress is a marker of France’s hopes, their fellow title contenders should be worried. The wing has scored in seven straight matches and 14 times this year. Two tries here took him to second overall in their men’s try-scorers’ chart, with 35, three behind Serge Blanco. As a whole, the French machine is tuning up satisfactorily with top spot in Pool A secured. A potential last-eight collision with Ireland or South Africa, or indeed Scotland, will be a monumental affair.

“It’s easy to congratulate Damian for his attacking performance,” Galthié said. “But it’s also easy when you have a team like that working for you. Players that become great are served by their teams; there’s always a balance.” The former France scrum-half added: “We’re happy to qualify … We’ll recuperate together, celebrate qualification, then turn to the quarter-final. For us, after a World Cup final against New Zealand [on opening night], our game next Sunday will be a second final.”

For Kieran Crowley, Galthié’s opposite number, his Italy tenure ends in profound disappointment, although crushing defeats by the All Blacks and now the hosts are offset by victories against Namibia and Uruguay.

“I’ve said before, I’d like to take this team forward,” he said. “I think the next World Cup is our cycle … we’ll get to the next tournament, and a lot of these players will have 60, 70 caps. But that wasn’t my decision.

“What needs to happen is that these players need to be treated with a bit of respect off the field … They [the Italian Rugby Federation] need to get some of that stuff sorted. Quite honestly, I don’t know if I’d want to be involved unless that gets sorted. I respect these guys, these players and staff. They’ve gone way beyond … and yet people will judge us on these last two games. It’s disappointing.”

Damaging setbacks have arrived with regularity for France, most notably Antoine Dupont’s fractured cheekbone. But the prop Cyril Baille had returned from injury in the thrashing of Namibia, along with the estimable Jonathan Danty in midfield, and both started against Italy.

Any hint of home nerves was calmed by the try for Penaud that stemmed from the first attack. Uini Atonio and Thibaud Flament were both involved, busting through tackles and creating a huge overlap for Penaud. Thomas Ramos belted over a penalty and the pressure on Italy continued unabated, Penaud fluffing a grubber kick with another big overlap created.

The hosts quickly came again, and Penaud got his kick right this time, picking out Louis Bielle-Biarrey with a chip that the wing converted impeccably. Ramos flopped over after another fluent exchange with Gaël Fickou.

At 24-0 Italy temporarily steadied a listing ship. After Ange Capuozzo was removed for a head injury assessment, Simone Ferrari powered over, but the television match official spotted a high hit by Ferrari on Maxime Lucu and the try was chalked off. Almost immediately, Penaud went over at the other end to secure a bonus point after fielding Matthieu Jalibert’s cross-kick. It was 31-0 at half-time.

Things got worse for Italy when Jalibert darted through a gap seven minutes after the break and when Peato Mauvaka, the France hooker, crashed across the line, Italian heads were beginning to drop alarmingly.

Capuozzo failed his HIA – another unwelcome blow – while Galthié’s thoughts were turning to managing his resources for the quarter-final: Melvyn Jaminet replaced Ramos and Yoram Moefana, freshly introduced in midfield for Fickou, jogged in for the seventh on 63 minutes.

Italy mustered a consolation score via Manuel Zuliani, his try converted by the fly-half Tommaso Allan, before Moefana completed a bright cameo with his second.

“Our goal is to win the game,” Galthié said of France’s eight-try display. “There are several boxes to tick. The important thing is that at the end of the game, we end up ahead. We are not here to show off, or to look good. We’re here to win.” He added that he expects the injured Dupont and Julien Marchand to play during the knockout stages.

When flanker Charles Ollivon – sitting alongside his head coach – was asked about next Sunday’s opponents, Galthié interjected. “We can’t know our opponent. Have you played tomorrow’s game already? There is a Scotland v Ireland game that may modify the quarter-finals. If you are talking about our quarter-final opponents, it’s quite simple. It’s a World Cup final for us.”",Damien Penaud leads historic rout of Italy as France confirm progress in style,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/oct/06/rugby-world-cup-damien-penaud-leads-rout-of-italy-as-france-confirm-progress-in-style,The Guardian
sports,Kanishka Prakash,2023-10-30T22:30:39+00:00,"2023 has been a topsy-turvy year for many teams. While some have outshone others, these 5 teams are at a crossroads, with a common stifling problem. Amid the heavy restructuring that many of the MLB teams have seen of late, there are pentagonal vacancies for managers. The New York Mets, the Los Angeles Angels, the Houston Astros, the Cleveland Guardians, and the San Diego Padres are in dire need of filling up the managerial position as the year ends.

America’s Favorite Video Today

While some team representatives skim through names within the MLB world, some hope to look for an outside hire. It could be a risky state for all of them. Nevertheless, there are many possibilities and roadblocks one might encounter. Be it budgetary issues, past performance, or availability of candidates, these teams have not had success in putting a pin on one candidate. That said, the skipper market is abuzz!

Starting With The Los Angeles Angels

ADVERTISEMENT Article continues below this ad

After Joe Maddon was relieved of his managerial duties, Phil Nevin signed up as the interim manager for the remaining 106 games of 2022. Post that, he went on to sign a one-year contract to manage the Angels in 2023, and the interim tag was lifted. Nevin’s 2024 club option was rejected by the Halos, who underwent partial two seasons of 119-149 (.444) play under his supervision. Since this was a non-negotiable, the seat stands vacant.

The biggest challenge in this scenario is that the Angels star, Shohei Ohtani is yet to reveal which team he would be joining. In case the Angels re-sign the two-way phenom, the manager would get to head the roster with the 2021 MVP and Mike Trout. A once in a lifetime opportunity. On the flip side, if they lose Ohtani, the roster would need a solid revamp. Not to mention the Angles are infamous for their below-par farm system and playoff drought spanning 9 seasons.

With that out in the open, what are the possible options for the Halos? Ray Montgomery could be an option, considering that he began his tenure with the Angels. Walt Weiss could potentially be a decent fit, too. Weiss has been a part of a successful team in the Atlanta Braves recently, having been their bench coach since before the 2018 season. Additionally, among other options are Ron Washington and Clayton McCullough. Though these options are open, no solid information has been revealed yet as to who would fill up the position.

Moving On To The Houston Astros

After his fourth season with the Astros and his 26th big league managerial season, Dusty Baker announced his retirement last week. Houston won the 2022 World Series and two pennants while the 74-year-old was in charge. Despite the starry possibilities of winning, the Texas Rangers defeated the Astros in the ALCS 2023.

With that seat now waiting to be warmed up, the future manager would manage a seasoned roster that appears ready to make another push at winning a World Series after winning six of the previous seven AL West championships. However, given Luis Garcia’s Tommy John surgery and Lance McCullers Jr.’s forearm surgery, the starting pitchers are expected to be shaky.

That said, there are some obvious options available to replace Dusty. One of the most sensible picks for a smooth transition would be Joe Espada, age 48. Since 2018, he has been the bench coach for the Astros. Baker relied on him in the dugout throughout his productive tenure as manager of Houston.

Apart from him, Buck Showalter, former New York Mets manager, Don Mattingly, Toronto Blue Jays bench coach, and A. J. Hinch, Detroit Tigers manager could be other possibilities.

Next Up Is Cleveland Guardians

Following an 11-year tenure with Cleveland that included leading the team to a 921-757 record (.549), six playoff trips, and the 2016 AL pennant, Terry Francona announced his resignation. The record made him the winningest manager in franchise history. He had managed the Guardians till the conclusion of the 2023 season, but now, owing to health concerns, he decides to put his wellbeing first.

Since Cleveland usually has one of the lowest payrolls in baseball, the team’s lineup won’t be receiving a lot of outside reinforcement. It is clear that the Guardians are not keen on getting someone from within MLB; they are open to outside hires as well. As long as the new candidate can follow Terry’s principles.

One applicant slated for an interview was Craig Albernaz. He is the catching and bullpen coach for the San Francisco Giants, according to Paul Hoynes of Cleveland.com. Despite lacking Major League managerial experience, the 40-year-old has led two championship-winning Tampa Bay Rays teams. Another likely candidate could be Carlos Mendoza, who is the bench coach for the New York Yankees. Though he too lacks managerial experience in MLB, the 43-year-old is familiar with the Yankees system, suiting well for Cleveland.

Speaking Of NY, The New York Mets Are On The Lookout

In his first season as manager, Buck Showalter guided the Mets to a 101-61 record. With that, he earned him the 2022 NL Manager of the Year Award. However, despite having baseball’s largest budget, the Mets ended their 2023 with a disastrous 75-87. Under the new president of baseball operations David Stearns, the organization is taking a fresh approach. The man who described 2023 as “the roller coaster of disappointment and hope” presiding over the Mets views his limited options.

Gabe Kapler made the exit three days before the San Francisco Giants season’s conclusion; he could post as a suited candidate. Another likely possibility would be Craig Counsell, who is nearing the end of his contract with the Milwaukee Brewers. Counsell is the guy to watch out for this summer because of his excellent relationship with David Stearns. This newest president of baseball operations for the Mets is a former Brewer himself.

The Fifth Team In The List Is San Diego Padres

Bob Melvin was said to be returning to the Padres as manager, despite the team’s 82-80 record and 2023 postseason absence. But in a turn of events, the San Francisco Giants hired Melvin when San Diego gave permission to interview him for SanFran’s managerial vacancy.

Now, the Padres’ vacant position is linking to former Cardinals manager Mike Shildt multiple times. Bob Nightengale of USA Today Sports reports that Shildt is the front-runner to take over. “The Padres will be hiring their sixth manager in just 10 years under (general manager) A. J. Preller. Former St. Louis Cardinals manager Mike Shildt is the favorite while associate manager Ryan Flaherty is getting strong consideration,” Nightengale said. With that, one has to wait and watch who serves as the best fit.

With the facts broken down, it is a matter of time that the teams narrow down their best options. MLB world will welcome 2024 with high expectations. With new management, the fans expect teams to come back with great vigor and ferocity.

The Royals continue to splurge in the offseason. Per MLB.com's Anne Rogers, Kansas City signed outfielder Hunter Renfroe to a one-year, $5.5 million deal with a player option for 2025 worth $7.5 million, as well as right-hander Michael Wacha to a two-year, $32 million deal with an opt-out after 2024.

The only question mark left in the Glasnow trade was the figures on the extension he'd wind up signing with the Dodgers. Now, the numbers are in, and the deal is set to be completed.

Per Passan, Glasnow will be signing a five-year, $135 million deal with the Dodgers. Passan reported the deal begins in 2024, and could reach up to $145 million if the Dodgers pick up a $30 million option at the end of the contract. He also reported that unlike Ohtani's deal, there will be no deferred money.

As had been reported for a few days, the deal between the Dodgers and Rays for Tyler Glasnow is coming to fruition. Los Angeles has reportedly acquired the right-handed starting pitcher, along with outfielder Manuel Margot, for RHP Ryan Pepiot and OF Jonny Deluca.

Glasnow is expected to sign a contract extension with the Dodgers as a result of the trade. The 30-year-old is in the final year of a two-year deal he sinked with the Rays in 2023, and was set to be free agent in 2025.

The Phillies have not been one of the more frequent names connected to Yamamoto, however the Japanese free agent reportedly met with the team. The starting pitcher has met with a number of teams, including the Dodgers, Mets, Yankees and Red Sox.

Bellinger would be returning to the Cubs, the team with which he rebuilt his value after a down year with the Dodgers. If he signed with the Blue Jays, he'd be bringing the powerful left-handed bat the team sought when it pursued Ohtani.

Tellez hit 35 home runs as a centerpiece of the Brewers' lineup in 2022, but he took a significant step back in 2023 after starting the season on a roll. Between first base and the DH role, however, the Pirates figure to give Tellez near-everyday playing time in hopes his power bat finds its form.

Lee is just 25 and was an on-base machine in Korea, batting .340 in his KBO career. While his power was inconsistent between seasons, Lee was a sought-after bat in free agency and drew heavy interest from the Padres as well.

According to The Athletic, Ohtani will defer a whopping $680 million of his $700 million contract from the Dodgers, receiving only $2 million per year.

The two-time MVP will receive $68 million per year, without interest, from 2034-43, making the present-day value of the contract much less than it originally appeared.

Yamamoto is the biggest fish on the free-agent market right now, and he's being pursued by a handful of big-market teams including the Yankees and Dodgers. The Giants have missed out on some of the most prominent free agents over the last two offseasons, so there might be incentive to make Yamamoto a massive offer to try and stay relevant in the NL West after the Dodgers' Ohtani signing.

Ohtani joins a Dodgers lineup that already features two former MVPs in Mookie Betts and Freddie Freeman, both of whom were NL MVP finalists in 2023. While he won't pitch again until 2025, Ohtani's power and on-base ability gives Los Angeles the most dangerous trio of hitters in the sport.

After a heartbreaking 2023 season, they now have to cope with the impending exit of their star two-way star, Shohei Ohtani. The team is also open to trading their nine-time Silver Slugger hitter Mike Trout, should he request it. In a huge miss, a team that couldn’t do well even with two of the league’s biggest talents on their roster may lose said stars at the same time. Will they choose to stay in LA?

America’s Favorite Video Today

The Halos’ cross-town rivals, the Los Angeles Dodgers, have been eyeing the dynamic Troutani duo for a long time. However, despite fans’ expectations, the Dodgers’ Ohtani-Trout conquest might not take place—and for good reasons.

Do the Dodgers have the budget to afford Ohtani and Trout on the same roster?

ADVERTISEMENT Article continues below this ad

Shohei Ohtani’s next projected contract value is predicted to be around $500–$600 million. If it goes through, he will break Trout’s biggest MLB deal record of 12 years, $426.5 million. Now, we all know that the Dodgers have deep pockets; they have managed to maintain quite a costly lineup this season valued at $283 million. But can they afford two of baseball’s biggest superstars at full value?

Now, with Trout’s $426.5 million tagline, the slugger has an annual salary of about $35.45 million. He still has seven years left on his Angels contract, so get him in blue, the Dodgers will have to pay $248.15 million plus any extension value. Shohei Ohtani’s predicted $535 million for 11 years (according to a Sports Illustrated segment) will bring the Dodgers down to pay him a good $48.63 million annually.

The Dodgers already have six players whom they have to pay above $10 million a year: Freddie Freeman ($27 million), Mookie Betts ($25 million), Clayton Kershaw ($20 million), Chris Taylor ($15 million), Max Muncy ($13.5 million), and J.D. Martinez ($10 million). Among the top-paid players, Clayton Kershaw is exiting the team this season. That, along with a few other player offloads, will free up enough space in the Dodgers payroll to support two $25 million or three $10 million p/a players on their team. Neither Trout nor Ohtani falls within that price range, so keeping both together at the same time would not be a feasible option for the Dodgers right now.

Pitchers or Hitters? Who Will the Dodgers Prioritize This Free Agency?

The Dodgers have been in dire need of pitchers for a few seasons. Their current highest strikeout rate by a pitcher in a single postseason is 137 SOs by Clayton Kershaw, followed by 119 SOs by Bobby Miller and 117 SOs by Julio Urias. With Shohei Ohtani’s high strikeout rate of 167 this season, he’ll be an invaluable addition to the team. However, there’s a little hiccup that could keep that from happening.

Ohtani will not be available to pitch throughout the 2024 season due to an elbow ligament injury he’s currently recovering from. Given the pitcher’s unavoidable absence, it will not be advisable for the Dodgers to hire him until 2025. Yes, Ohtani does have magnificent hitting form as well. However, the team already has hitters like Freeman and Betts, who have scored 211 and 179 hits this regular season, respectively. Speaking of hitters, why will they still want Trout to join the team despite having better-than-average hitters on the team?

Why will the Dodgers sign an injury-prone Trout?

Mike Trout might have been absent for most of the 2023 season, but his career records boast the story of a legendary hitter who has given more than his salt’s worth to his current team. He has bagged 1624 hits and 940 RBIs with an 85.2 WAR and .301 BA across his 12-year-long baseball career. Unfortunately, Trout has become a victim of an injury streak, starting in 2022. He got his hands, left groin, back, and foot injured five times in the entire season; in 2023, he faced two hand injuries in two consecutive months.

Despite his injury-prone history, the more logical option for the Dodgers would be to choose Trout over Ohtani; the team will not be able to afford them both at the same time. Trout comes with a cheaper price tag of $35.45 million compared to Ohtani’s projected $48.63 million. The Dodgers could use his All-Star form in between injuries if he still keeps getting them in 2024. With Shohei Ohtani, the Dodgers would be wasting a year letting him play at-bat, with a high chance of getting him further injured and missing more pitching time. Isn’t it better to have a consistently wounded soldier than risk losing an overperforming one in a game of chances?

Why would Mike Trout switch to another Los Angeles team?

Trout has been pretty persistent about sticking with the Los Angeles Angels from the very start. The team has been transparent about not stopping him should he choose to play for another team, but he does not want to do that. However, it seems that the Angels will have a hard time affording a player like Trout in the foreseeable future, as they have to win a good number of games to stay in the playoffs and keep a steady income of revenue throughout the seasons. Considering their 73-game win record this season, that seems like a pipe dream right now.

ADVERTISEMENT Article continues below this ad

Trout is 32 years old, which means that he has already hit the MLB average retirement age of 30. He still has a lot left to give to the diamond for approximately 6 more years. If the Dodgers have the chance to draft them, should they go with Ohtani, Trout, both, or neither? Let us know your opinions in the comment box.

It was the sequel Newcastle United did not want, the second cruel comeback in as many Champions League games. For some 45 minutes, including half-time, they could savour the sight of a table that showed them in second, permitting them to imagine a date with Real Madrid or Bayern Munich in the knockout stages. And then, little more than half an hour, they were ejected from Europe altogether.

Christian Pulisic’s equaliser threatened to condemn them to the Europa League. Samuel Chukwueze’s winner instead meant that spot goes to AC Milan. The group of death went down to the dying minutes, but Newcastle have perished. They had savoured a return to Europe but there will be no continental trips for them in the spring of 2024.

And, after Kylian Mbappe’s controversial 98th-minute leveller in Paris, they can rue the loss of another lead. Once again, they may feel entitled to believe they should have won, but for different reasons. For much of the night, they were rampant and had Milan reeling. Yet, last season’s Champions League semi-finalists hung in the game, scored twice and hit the woodwork twice more. For Newcastle, a third consecutive defeat may come with the sense that their injuries came at a cost. Theirs was another colossal effort, a far better performance than at Everton or Tottenham, but while Eddie Howe had the luxury of one attacking substitute – in Alexander Isak – three replacements combined for Milan’s decider: first Luka Jovic found Noah Okafor and he picked out Chukwueze, who placed a shot past Martin Dubravka.

It was a sign of Newcastle’s determination to win, not to settle for the point and the Europa League place, that they were short-staffed at the back because centre-back Fabian Schar had charged into the Milan box in open play. Likewise, in a frantic finale, they almost conceded a third: with Dubravka out of his goal, Theo Hernandez almost scored from the halfway line and Fikayo Tomori hit the post.

As they wonder what might have been, they can reflect on the turning point of Pulisic’s strike, around the time Warren Zaire-Emery drew Paris Saint-Germain level against Borussia Dortmund. Newcastle failed to clear as the ball ricocheted around their box before Olivier Giroud found Pulisic to poke in a shot. The American had been a target for Newcastle last January; how they must now regret the fact he joined Milan in the summer.

Then, with 11 minutes remaining, Rafael Leao sprinted clear and shot against the post. If this had threatened to be the derby of the depleted, Milan had Leao back for the first time in a month. Newcastle had Callum Wilson able to start, but their goal came from a less regular source, with a thunderbolt from Joelinton.

Joelinton thumped home Newcastle’s goal (Reuters)

One of the great success stories of Howe’s reign, the misfit forward who was reinvented as a talismanic midfielder gave Newcastle a deserved lead. Joelinton’s rasping, rising shot from the edge of the box flew past Mike Maignan. He had taken Miguel Almiron’s pass and teed himself up. His initial non-celebration may have reflected his own surprise at the unerring accuracy of his strike.

Theirs was the right response to the disappointment in Paris, a stirring effort. At this level, Newcastle do not possess a talent advantage but they can seek to outwork anyone. They rattled Milan by running at them. It took two astonishing interventions to stop them scoring both before and after Joelinton’s strike.

At 0-0, Fikayo Tomori made a magnificent goal-line tackle to stop Miguel Almiron applying the finishing touch to Joelinton’s low cross. It was a remarkable rescue act but pressure told when the Brazilian struck. Another almost joined him on the scoresheet at 1-1.

Newcastle saw their European dreams slip away (Getty)

Maignan tipped Bruno Guimaraes’ 20-yard shot onto the bar. As Nick Pope had denied Milan victory in San Siro with a string of saves, Stefano Pioli’s team could testify to the difference brilliant goalkeeping can make. Now they benefited from it. Newcastle had 17 shots, eight on target, but Maignan was only beaten once. Milan had two shots on target but Dubravka conceded twice.

The loss of the injured Pope may have proved pivotal. But perhaps seven-time winners, and a side who reached the last four last year, displayed greater knowhow. Maybe they simply had greater strength in depth on a night when Kieran Trippier and Anthony Gordon were taken off because they seemed exhausted.

Newcastle can nevertheless depart the competition with heads held high. One win and five points seem meagre tallies for their contribution to the competition. They have proof it can be unforgiving, reasons to return. Their first Champions League campaign for two decades will surely not be their last for another 20 years. But it is over, and they are left to wonder about what might have been.",Another cruel comeback sees Newcastle perish in group of death,https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/newcastle-ac-milan-result-champions-league-b2463663.html,The Independent - Sports

But the level of accounting has come higher for the 27-time winners because of the highest expectations. The management has comprehended the situation and is actively seeking to make changes for the 2024 season. Be it trimming the squad and releasing a few players, including superstar Gleyber Torres, they look to bring about changes. But given that they are already short on options, it brings up the question: Is the move justified?

America’s Favorite Video Today

Although it was a decent season for the second baseman, the lack of consistency brought Torres under scrutiny for changes for the upcoming season. Also, given he is currently in arbitration with the Yankees, it adds to his trade chances. The reason is that the team won’t want to lose the opportunity to cash in some money from his trade. The decision appears promising as the team seeks a shift, but the data tells a different story. Gleyber Torres’s Exit Becomes the Talk of the Town as the Yankees Look for a Rebuild The New York Yankees have been in the news since the league stage ended. First, because of the possibility of a third-party audit, which was later shunted out. Later, the comments from Aaron Judge brought a lot of attention to the workings of the team, conflicts, and divisions between the core four. Now it’s the assumptions of changes with the idea of cutting down the $300 million budget for the next season. One name that is making the rounds for an exit is Gleyber Torres. Notably, the 26-year-old avoided arbitration ahead of the 2023 season and signed a $9.95 million contract. It was a brilliant move, given the requirements of the Bronx Bombers. Torres fulfilled it for most of the season to finish it on a high, scoring 90 runs, 25 home runs, and 68 RBIs at an average of 0.273 and an OPS of 0.800. Torres also finished at the top of the batting charts for the team, alongside captain Aaron Judge, clinching the most hits and recording an OBP of 0.347. The infielder also finished second in the fielding department behind the team’s Gold Glove prospect, Anthony Volpe. The seasoned player made 80 double plays, with 563 chances created at a fielding percentage of 0.975. The performance from Gleyber has been crucial in a season filled with injuries on both fronts. But the Yankees are not favoring his services for the upcoming season. There are two reasons behind the interest of the Miami Marlins and the push for lower spending. As mlbtraderumors.com suggests, Torres is expected to earn $15.3 million next year; his trade could save the Yankees some money. The Marlins have been interested in him for a long time, and the Pinstripes can have a good deal for the outfielder. Considering the advantages, this appears promising. However, is it a worthwhile endeavor? Should the New York Yankees Trade Gleyber Torres Ahead of the New Season? Nothing has worked well for the New York Yankees this season. They had their worst finish in seven years, even after having all the resources. The Yankees are seeking a shift in their strategy, which has exceeded their initial expectations. This shift encompasses alterations in both offensive and defensive personnel, and surprisingly, it involves Gleyber Torres. Although it is a reboot button from Brian Cashman for a better 2024, should the Yankees refraining from including Torres? The answer is simple: they should indeed because of his worth as a player. It may sound huge as they expect Torres to earn $15 million, but it is not a big ask for the multibillion-dollar Yankees. The 2009 champions can easily fulfill this request without constraining their spending.

Plus, Torres is the sole option for the Yankees at second base. With limited options available in the market, the team is in the circumstances to spend more. And if the Yankees are for other infielders, they may have to reshuffle to make their place in the squad. It will include the shift of Oswaldo Peraza from third baseman to second. However, Peraza could not do well this season, even after all the positives. His involvement in unique positions could be a risk for the team.

Moreover, free agents Whit Merrifield and Adam Frazier have not done well. Given that the Yankees finished second last in total hits and had over 1400 strikeouts, losing a player with the best record in both parameters will not be ideal. Notably, Torres has a 14.6% strikeout rate, with only a handful of players recording a lower rate. He also covered a lot of bases this season to finish second to Judge. All these factors make him a player that the Yankees should keep as they look for a change in 2024.

not in the best shape, losing Torres could haunt the Yankees further. It will be interesting to see how the most successful team approaches this. Will they be able to find genuine replacements on the market? Only time will tell. His trading is not worth it for the Yankees, which will further reduce the options in the outfield. With rookies and the farm not compensating for the demand, it would be a big ask for them to fulfill. With Jasson Dominguez Anthony Rizzo , and DJ LeMahieu

What is the College Football Playoff?

The College Football Playoff starts with the New Year’s Six bowl games, of which two act as semifinal games to determine which teams will play in the National Championship.

Those six games, also known as the NY6, include:

Rose Bowl Game presented by Capital One (Pasadena, California)

Allstate Sugar Bowl (New Orleans, Louisiana)

PlayStation Fiesta Bowl (Glendale, Arizona)

Chick-fil-A Peach Bowl (Atlanta, Georgia)

Goodyear Cotton Bowl Classic (Arlington, Texas)

Capital One Orange Bowl (Miami Gardens, Florida)

These six games are the most iconic and important bowl games in all of college football and usually invite the top-rated teams in the country to play. Currently, two of them, on a rotating basis, act as the semifinal games for the CFP.

However, that will expand to include quarterfinal games as of the 2024-25 season when the CFP expands to a 12-team format.

How does a team qualify for the NY6 bowl games?

A selection committee ranks the best four teams in the country and selects them for the College Football Playoff semifinal games. Those teams compete for a chance to play in the National Championship.

The other four NY6 bowl games are typically given to champions from the Power Five conferences and the top-rated teams and champions from the Group of Five conferences.

What is the College Football Playoff National Championship?

The CFP National Championship is the final game in the NCAA Division I Football Bowl Subdivision season, crowning the country’s best team. The winners of the two CFP semifinal games square off in this contest, usually slated for a Monday in early January.

The game, which started in 2014 after replacing the Bowl Championship Series, attracts millions of viewers. That popularity also makes it one of the most-wagered-on sporting events in the country.

The championship games are scheduled as follows for the next few years:

2023-24: Jan. 8 in Houston

Jan. 8 in Houston 2024-25: Jan. 20 in Atlanta

Jan. 20 in Atlanta 2025-26: Jan. 19 in Miami

Again, you can see the schedule being pushed later into January once the CFP field expands to 12 teams in 2024-25.

Which schools have won the CFP National Championship?

The College Football Playoff National Championship has been taking place since 2015. Here are the previous winners.

2022-23 season: Georgia Bulldogs

Georgia Bulldogs 2021-22 season: Georgia Bulldogs

Georgia Bulldogs 2020-21 season: Alabama Crimson Tide

Alabama Crimson Tide 2019-20 season: LSU Tigers

LSU Tigers 2018-19 season: Clemson Tigers

Clemson Tigers 2017-18 season: Alabama Crimson Tide

Alabama Crimson Tide 2016-17 season: Clemson Tigers

Clemson Tigers 2015-16 season: Alabama Crimson Tide

Alabama Crimson Tide 2014-15 season: Ohio State Buckeyes

College bowl games FAQ

How many college bowl games are there annually?

The bowl game season lasts three weeks and consists of 43 games, including the NCAA football national championship.

What are the New Year’s Six bowl games?

The New Year’s Six is a series of high-profile bowl games. They include:

Rose Bowl Game presented by Capital One (Pasadena, California)

Allstate Sugar Bowl (New Orleans)

PlayStation Fiesta Bowl (Glendale, Arizona)

Chick-fil-A Peach Bowl (Atlanta)

Goodyear Cotton Bowl Classic (Arlington, Texas)

Capital One Orange Bowl (Miami Gardens, Florida)

What is the best time to bet on the College Football National Championship?

Choosing when to bet on the NCAA football national championship comes down to risk versus reward. Making your bets when the lines are first released gives you the best odds and potential winnings but with precious little information.

You might back a team that’s clearly not going to win by Week 4.

The longer you wait, the clearer the picture becomes, thanks to data and team performance, but the odds tighten up because sportsbooks are using that same information to make adjustments. You’ll have a more educated choice, but the odds will be less favorable and your payout smaller.","College Bowl Odds, Spreads, Money Lines and Totals - NCAAF 2023 Bowl Season",https://www.sportingnews.com/us/betting/news/ncaaf-bowl-odds/275d2598457399b19a65202d,Sporting News
sports,Yardbarker Staff,2023-11-30T22:29:33+00:00,"Even the Philadelphia Eagles and Dallas Cowboys – two of the NFL's best teams – have hot seats. No seats, however, may be more sizzling than those occupied by two head coaches in the NFC South, one in the NFC North and another (surprisingly) in the NFC West.

Here is the hottest seat on each NFC team as determined by Yardbarker NFL writers.

NFC East

DALLAS COWBOYS | Cornerback Trevon Diggs: In September, Diggs suffered a season-ending ACL injury. His replacement, DaRon Bland, has wowed us with an NFL-record five pick-sixes. There's no way Bland can go back to slot corner in 2024, so the heat will be on Diggs next season as a probable replacement for Stephon Gilmore at left cornerback.

NEW YORK GIANTS | Quarterback Daniel Jones: Out for the season with an ACL injury, Jones has no way to dissuade Giants ownership from taking a quarterback high in the QB-rich 2024 NFL Draft. New York can (and will) get out of his $160M contract in 2025.

PHILADELPHIA EAGLES | Wide receiver Quez Watkins: Philadelphia’s supposed No. 3 receiver has a measly four catches for 21 yards. While he missed five games with a hamstring injury, Olamide Zaccheaus and Julio Jones combined for 132 yards receiving and three touchdowns.

WASHINGTON COMMANDERS | Owner Josh Harris: He oversaw the controversial “Process” as owner of the Philadelphia 76ers. He’ll need a better plan this offseason when “I’m not Dan Snyder” stops working. At 4-8, the Commanders are floundering in his first season of ownership. — Bruce Ewing

NFC West

ARIZONA CARDINALS | Quarterback Kyler Murray: The inconsistent Murray has five more games this season to prove to a new front office and coaching staff that he is the long-term answer at quarterback. If he doesn’t show them what they want to see, the Cardinals have the draft capital (including two first-round picks) to land a franchise quarterback at the top of the QB-rich 2024 NFL Draft.

LOS ANGELES RAMS | Wide receiver Cooper Kupp: At his peak, he was one of the best offensive players in the league, but age (30) and injuries (appearing in 16 of a possible 28 games the past two seasons) have hurt his production. He has been a non-factor over the past five games (12 catches for 127 yards) while young receivers Puka Nacua and Tutu Atwell have stepped up.

SAN FRANCISCO 49ERS | Head coach Kyle Shanahan: The 49ers have done almost everything possible under Shanahan except win a Super Bowl. Fair or not, not winning a title with a stacked roster — especially on offense (Christian McCaffrey, Deebo Samuel, Brock Purdy, George Kittle) — would be a massive disappointment. His job is in zero danger, but his rep may be.

SEATTLE SEAHAWKS | Quarterback Geno Smith: The Seahawks passed on drafting a QB in 2023 and re-signed Smith, but he has taken a significant step back. Entering Thursday's game against Dallas, his completion percentage was down from 2022 (69.8 to 65.4 percent) despite the impressive offensive weapons around him. Seattle has an out in his contract after this season that would only carry a $17.4 million dead-cap number, per Spotrac. — Adam Gretz

NFC North

CHICAGO BEARS | Head coach Matt Eberflus: The Bears have only one division win during Eberflus' tenure and his seven wins are the fewest by a Bears head coach through his first 29 games. In his second season as HC, the defense has improved, but positive results are hard to come by behind a lackluster offense ranked 19th in yards (323.2) and 21st in points per game (20.2).

DETROIT LIONS | Defensive coordinator Aaron Glenn: The Lions finished near the bottom of the NFL in points against (31st and 28th) the past two seasons and are on pace to do so again for the third time in as many years under Glenn (24th, 23.5). Furthermore, the unit has regressed in 2023, with opponents averaging 29 points per game since Week 7 (five games).

GREEN BAY PACKERS | Wide receiver Christian Watson: The popular choice to emerge as the team's No. 1 wideout, he has underachieved in his second season, outshined by fellow 2022 draftee Romeo Doubs (seven TDs) and rookie Jayden Reed (five TDs). Watson had his best game in Week 12 (five receptions, 94 yards, one TD), but was nearly invisible before that, recording 16 catches (257 yards) and two TDs over seven games.

MINNESOTA VIKINGS | Running back Alexander Mattison: He has floundered in his first season as the starter, producing zero rushing TDs on a career-best 13.2 attempts a game and ranking 22nd among qualified backs in yards per carry (3.8). He's still getting more snaps than second-year RB Ty Chandler, but the Vikings will likely look for a replacement this offseason if Mattison doesn't show more. — Mike Santa Barbara

NFC South

ATLANTA FALCONS | Quarterback Desmond Ridder: The Falcons have a golden path toward a division crown, but Ridder’s two-interception performance against the Saints in Week 12 was another reminder Atlanta isn’t a legitimate contender with him. He’ll finish the season leading the Falcons, who will probably get a home playoff game, but the clock is ticking on Ridder’s time as an NFL starter.

CAROLINA PANTHERS | General manager Scott Fitterer: Owner David Tepper should have the hottest seat, but he isn’t going to fire himself. Instead, when he runs out of people on the sidelines to fire, he’ll take out his frustration on a GM (partly) responsible for constructing the least impressive roster in football.

NEW ORLEANS SAINTS | Head coach Dennis Allen: New Orleans' 5-6 record against the league’s easiest schedule is bad. What's worse, however, is running back Alvin Kamara’s concerning claim after a 24-15 loss to the Falcons that the team doesn’t have an identity. Allen — who has a 20-44 record as head coach of the Raiders and Saints — needs a playoff appearance or there could be big changes in New Orleans.

TAMPA BAY BUCCANEERS | Head coach Todd Bowles: At 4-7, the Bucs are only a game back of first in the division, but they are fading fast, going 1-6 in their past seven games.

Bowen bundled home at the second attempt in the 72nd minute, his 11th league goal this season, and Kudus struck his fourth goal in as many games to settle matters.

It was another worrying setback for manager Erik ten Hag as United suffered a 13th defeat in 26 games in all competitions.

Manchester United legend Peter Schmeichel lashed the team’s lack of a plan and blasted them for looking slow against the Hammers.

“It was just in many ways irrelevant. There was no plan to it,” he said. “West Ham got an easy win which is a little bit silly to say.

“When I look at the team, I don’t know what the identity of the team is. What is the style of play, what’s the plan?

“He needs to take a step back, ten Hag, and say what do I need to do with these players I have available in order to first of all stop leaking goals, because that’s a problem, and secondly, score goals – how do I get the next goal? Four games without a goal, it’s a long time.”

Ten Hag tried to put a positive spin on the performance by claiming to BBC that they were the better side before the first goal.

“I think it was a decent 72 minutes where we didn’t take our chances. We should’ve gone in the lead but we didn’t and then it was one moment of switching off,” he said.

“At this moment we are not top, but we have seen last week against the top of this league we were head-to-head. We didn’t score, we had the best opportunities of the game.

“There we defended very well for 90 minutes, that has to be always our standard like what we did there. You have to bring that to every game on the pitch.”

sports,Edward Sutelan,2023-11-12T23:30:03+00:00,"If you tuned into ""Sunday Night Football"" expecting to see some offense, you tuned in on the wrong weekend.

The Jets and Raiders were locked into an old-school, defense-heavy primetime clash that featured nothing but six field goals through the first three quarters of the game. It wasn't until 50 seconds into the fourth quarter that Las Vegas finally picked up the first touchdown, with Michael Mayer making a leaping grab in the end zone to put the Raiders up 16-9.

In such a low-scoring game, that touchdown felt, even as early as it was, that it could be a game-winner. And indeed, it was as the Raiders held the Jets to just a field goal the rest of the game and picked off Zach Wilson late to stymy New York in a 16-12 win.

It wasn't exactly a quarterback showdown that many might have expected in the preseason when this game appeared to be Aaron Rodgers vs. Jimmy Garoppolo. Instead, Wilson went 23-for-39 with 263 yards, no touchdowns and a pick (rushing four times for 54 yards) while Aidan O'Connell completed 16-of-27 passes for 153 yards, a touchdown and an interception.

The Raiders largely turned to running back Josh Jacobs, who set season-best marks with 27 carries for 116 yards, while the Jets' running back duo of Breece Hall and Dalvin Cook was held to just 17 rushes for 54 yards.

The win for the Raiders already marks their second in as many games since the firing of Josh McDaniels, with interim coach Antonio Pierce getting off to an undefeated 2-0 start to his career. It also vaults the Raiders into a deep AFC playoff race, with Las Vegas joining the now five AFC wild-card contenders with at least five wins.

For the Jets, it marked a second straight game without a touchdown, and gives them their second consecutive loss before hitting the road to face the Bills in Week 11.

Fourth quarter

11:26 p.m.: Wilson's final pass after being chased out of the pocket is batted down, and the Raiders hang on to win 16-12.

11:24 p.m.: It's time for Hail Marys, and the first to Gipson sails out of bounds. With five seconds left, the Raiders call their second timeout.

11:22 p.m.: Wilson spikes the first pass with no one open, then connects with Conklin on a dump-off for nine yards. He goes back to Conklin with the clock rolling, and the tight end makes an impressive leaping grab at the Raiders' 45. The Jets use their last timeout with 12 seconds left.

11:20 p.m.: Even after backing up five yards, Cole still boots the ball too far. He tries to angle it toward the sideline, and it bounces into the end zone for a touchback. Jets will get the ball at the 20 with 53 seconds left.

11:19 p.m.: Raiders opt to trust O'Connell to put the game away and have him attempt a pass, but his pass attempt to Mayer is batted down by Jermaine Johnson. That saves the Jets a timeout and means they will get the ball back after a punt. Raiders take a delay of game penalty before the kick.

11:18 p.m.: Jacobs is stuffed for no gain, and the Jets use their second timeout. 1:05 left, and the Raiders facing a pivotal third-and-5.

11:17 p.m.: Jacobs gets five, and the Jets call a quick timeout.

11:16 p.m.: Hall can only get a pair of yards on a check down to the right out to the 20. The next play, Wilson tries to get the ball out to Lazard and is picked off by Robert Spillane, who returns the ball out to the Raiders' 40. With 1:14 and the Jets having three timeouts, this one's all but over.

11:11 p.m.: Wilson misses Lazard over the middle, then goes back to Conklin, who makes the low catch two yards shy of the first down marker. Wilson connects with Wilson again for six up to the 22 to bring up a fresh set of downs and the two-minute warning.

11:10 p.m.: The drive stays alive as Wilson dumps the ball off to Conklin, who stretches across for the first down at the 36.

11:08 p.m.: Uzomah makes a strong effort catching a pass, staying up after a big hit and powering his way up six yards. Play stops for an injury to Jakorian Bennett. Wilson tries a deep shot toward the end zone to Garrett Wilson, but in double coverage, the pass is broken up.

11:07 p.m.: New York keeps moving down the field, as after a three-yard catch from Garrett Wilson, Hall catches a quick pass underneath, makes some defenders miss and takes it up 10 yards to the Raiders 46.

11:06 p.m.: The call on the field stands, and the Jets immediately work to pay off the turnover as Zach Wilson starts the drive with a nice throw across the middle of the field to Lazard for 17 yards to the Jets 41.

11:03 p.m.: Costly turnover for the Raiders. Just as it felt the Raiders were inching toward putting the game away, Jacobs loses a fumble at the Jets' 25, and it's recovered by Ashtyn Davis. The turnover is being reviewed, and would be a massive swing if it stands.

11:01 p.m.: Zamir White gets his first carry of the day and appears to lose the football after gaining five, but the Raiders recover it. Jacobs gets the next handoff and appeared to be bottled up, but the line pushes him ahead for seven yards for a first down up to the Jets 29. Las Vegas grinding away the clock now with 6:14 left to play.

11 p.m.: Gutsy call by Pierce and the Raiders, who fake a sneak and instead hand the ball off to Carter, who races around the left end and speeds past the defense for 15 yards and a first down up to the Jets 41.

15 yards on 4th and inches. That equals a first down.

10:58 p.m.: Facing a third-and-8, O'Connell fires the ball out to Austin Hooper, who is brought down just shy of the first down. The Raiders will have a decision to make on a fourth-and-1 from the Las Vegas 44. C.J. Mosley was injured on the play, and has to come off the field.

10:56 p.m.: O'Connell tries a deep shot to Adams to start the drive, but the star receiver is double-covered. Jacobs gets Las Vegas back on schedule by racing his way up the middle for nine yards to set up a third-and-1, just stumbling short. He picks up that yard on a carry the next play to keep the chains moving.

10:54 p.m.: Raiders will start at the 25 with 11:58 to play.

10:51 p.m. Jets scoring play: The Jets offense stalls after a throw from Garrett Wilson on a trick play to Lazard misses, then a low throw from Zach Wilson to Cook that's missed as well. Wilson escapes pressure from the Raiders and manages a yard, but the call is to Zuerlein to boot the field goal. Raiders 16, Jets 12

10:48 p.m.: Trading explosive plays now. First Jacobs with the big run, now Hall catches a screen pass, and he bursts down the left sideline for 35 yards to the Las Vegas 40. Then Garrett Wilson makes a wide-open grab for 13 to the Raiders' 28.

Breece Hall just turned the screen pass into a 35-yard gain 😳

10:47 p.m.: Jets start at the 25.

10:45 p.m. Raiders scoring play: O'Connell fakes a sweep to Jacobs and throws a touchdown pass to a leaping Mayer in the end zone. First touchdown of the game comes with 14:10 left. Raiders 16, Jets 9

Third quarter

10:41 p.m.: Mayer drops a pass on first down, then Jacobs explodes down the field, racing up 40 yards to the Jets' 13. Carter punches out the football at the end of the run, but it rolls harmlessly out of bounds. Jacobs takes the next carry for five yards to wind down the third quarter with the Raiders now at the Jets' 8.

10:35 p.m.: Wilson to Wilson gains five to start the drive, but Zach is brought down the next play on a sack and the ball got loose. Mekhi Becton jumps on the ball to avoid disaster. Wilson tries to get the first down the next play with a deep shot to Taylor down the middle but it sails well over his head. New York punts, and Carter returns the ball 10 yards to the Raiders' 46 as Las Vegas again gets favorable field position to start a drive.

10:34 p.m.: Gipson attempts a kickoff return, but is brought down at the Jets 13 for a short return.

10:29 p.m. Raiders scoring play: Offense keeps trying to go through Jacobs, with him getting blown up for a loss of four before getting five yards on a toss to the right. But O'Connell way overthrows Adams, and the Raiders have to settle for the 40-yard field goal to tie the game with 2:36 left in the third quarter. Adams was furious there wasn't a penalty. All kicks so far tonight. Jets 9, Raiders 9

10:27 p.m.: O'Connell rifles a quick pass out to Hunter Renfrow, who races up and gets near the line of scrimmage but is just inches shy of the line. The Raiders opt to go for it and hand the ball to Jacobs, who finds a hole on the right side and gets the necessary yardage to the Jets 23 for the first.

10:26 p.m.: For the second time today, O'Connell takes a bad sack out to the Jets 42 that takes the Raiders out of field-goal range, but Jacobs catches a short pass and runs it up — ruled a carry since it was a lateral — for 12 yards to bring up a much more manageable third-and-6.

10:25 p.m.: Following a rush of no gain by Jacobs, Meyers makes a catch in front of a few defenders and makes them miss to pick up eight yards. O'Connell then goes with a pop pass to Jacobs, who bursts to the right sideline for three yards and the first down to the Jets 34.

10:19 p.m.: Quick three-and-out by the Jets, as Wilson steps up and fires an incompletion and Hall is brought down for a loss of a yard by Butler. After a false start to make it third-and-16, Wilson escapes out on the right side and manages to get 13 yards before stumbling and fall three shy of the first. Las Vegas gets an excellent return by Carter along the sideline, as he takes the punt from the Raiders 23 up to the Jets 46 for a 31-yard return.

10:14 p.m.: O'Connell tries to throw a tight end screen to Mayer, but has to spike it as his tight end was well contained. Gipson returns the punt five yards up to the Jets' 15 as the Jets prepare for their next drive.

10:11 p.m.: Impressive solo tackle by Quinnen Williams getting to Jacobs almost as soon as he gets the handoff in the backfield for a loss of three. Tre Tucker gets an end-around for nine yards to set up a much more manageable third-and-4. O'Connell scrambles for five to the left and gets the yardage, but for once, a penalty goes against the Raiders as a holding flag brings up a third-and-14 for the Raiders.

10:05 p.m.: Conklin gets a nice reception that would have brought up a fourth-and-4. The Jets are flagged for holding, which is accepted by the Raiders rather than taking the punt. Wilson gets a quick pass out to Malik Taylor for six yards, and now the Jets will punt. DeAndre Carter returns the punt six yards from the Raiders' 25 to 31, where Las Vegas will start its first drive of the second half.

10:04 p.m.: A low incompletion by Wilson to Wilson and a pickup of just two from Hall gets the Jets' drive off to a slow start. Wilson appeared to get a first down with a throw out to Gipson for 12 yards, but Carter is flagged for a chop block that vaults the Jets back to a third-and-21 at their own 14. Another rough penalty for the Jets, who now have six penalties for 68 yards.

10:02 p.m.: The Jets will begin the second half from their own 25 on a touchback.

Second quarter

9:45 p.m. Raiders scoring play: O'Connell misses Adams on back-to-back passes, and the Raiders opt to turn the ball to Jacobs for a yard before using their final timeout. Daniel Carlson drills the 54-yard field goal to make this a three-point game at the end of the first half. Jets 9, Raiders 6

9:43 p.m.: This time, a brutal Jets penalty on defense. O'Connell gets a pass out to Mayer for five yards, but Bryce Huff is flagged for roughing the passer that moves the Raiders all the way to the Jets 37 with 21 seconds.

9:42 p.m.: Raiders start a bit conservative with a run of six by Jacobs before O'Connell gets a quick pass out to Adams on the left side, giving the receiver space to pick up nine yards before going out of bounds to stop the clock with 32 seconds left in the half. He then dumps off a quick pass to Jacobs, who picks up eight before going out and stopping the clock at 26 seconds.

9:39 p.m.: Conklin makes a catch up the middle for eight yards, but on the next play, Wilson tries to scramble out of the pocket and has to run for a loss of a yard. Wilson then fires incomplete to Allen Lazard, who was racing down the left sideline. Jets punt the ball into the end zone for a touchback.

9:38 p.m.: Following a run of seven by Hall, Zach Wilson misses a pass attempt out to Garrett Wilson. Then the QB scrambles out to his left and takes off down the left sideline for 20 yards to the Jets' 41. He's now the team's leading rusher with two carries for 40 yards on the ground.

9:36 p.m.: Jets take the fair catch at their own 14. They've got 1:52 to make something happen.

9:34 p.m.: A pair of promising passing plays go for naught. Jakobi Meyers makes a few defenders miss on a nice catch for 13 yards, then O'Connell fires a strike to Adams for a pickup of 18 yards. But the Jets' pass-rush finally gets home as O'Connell is sacked, pressured into throwing out of bounds then sacked again. Raiders pushed from the New York 26 all the way back to the Jets' 46, and will now likely have to punt coming out of the two-minute warning.

9:29 p.m.: Jacobs came into the drive with just three total carries, but he's now carried it five straight times for 20 yards. O'Connell then picks up the third-and-1 by sneaking it for three yards.

9:27 p.m.: Three straight runs by Jacobs, punctuated by an impressive, shifty, five-yard run gets the Raiders the first down up to the Las Vegas 31.

9:22 p.m.: Needing only a yard, the Jets' backs come up short on both attempts, with Cook and Hall both being bottled up at the line of scrimmage for no gain. Jets decide to punt the ball from their own 38, and it goes into the end zone for a touchback. Raiders back on offense from their own 20 with 7:18 left in the half.

9:20 p.m.: Cook bounces out to the right, and gets out to the 29 for a pickup of 10. He follows that up by speeding to the left and racing up for nine yards to the Jets' 38 before he's brought down by Crosby.

9:16 p.m.: A pair of runs by Jacobs nets the Raiders just one yard, and O'Connell's deep shot to Adams is well past his intended target. The Raiders go three-and-out, and after an out-of-bounds punt from AJ Cole, the Jets will start at their own 19.

9:15 p.m.: Raiders will start from their own 25.

9:15 p.m.: Robertson has been ruled out with a concussion, per the team.

9:12 p.m. Jets scoring play: Wilson attempts a checkdown to Michael Carter, but the ball is tipped by Adam Butler. New York once again has to settle for a field goal. Jets 9, Raiders 3

9:09 p.m.: Hall runs for a yard, then is stuffed for no gain trying to get to the outside by Crosby. The Jets use their first timeout before the third-and-goal play from Las Vegas' 12-yard line.

9:08 p.m.: Stop if you've heard this before: good Jets play, bad Jets penalty. Hall ran for three yards up the middle for a touchdown, but Uzomah was flagged for holding a second time as he tried to block Maxx Crosby and free up space for Hall along the right side. Now a first-and-goal from the Raiders 13.

9:06 p.m.: Garrett Wilson makes a leaping grab for seven yards before Zach Wilson makes a stellar run along the right sideline. He initially was ruled to be in the end zone, but review confirmed he stepped out at the 3-yard line, making it a 20-yard run from the QB. First-and-goal now for the Jets.

9:05 p.m.: Raiders corner Amik Robertson had to be helped off the field and walked to the sideline. Appeared to be in the fencing response while on the ground.

9:02 p.m.: Another big Jets play overturned by a penalty. Hall appeared to have the first down for 11 yards, but Laken Tomlinson is flagged for holding. Jets will face a second-and-19.

First quarter

8:58 p.m.: Hall picks up a yard to bring the quarter to an end.

8:56 p.m.: O'Connell goes from nearly losing a fumble to throwing an interception right at Jordan Whitehead, who returns the pick out to the Raiders' 26. Raiders are challenging the interception, but since all turnovers are reviewed, their timeout is used.

8:55 p.m.: Near-disaster to start the drive for the Raiders, as O'Connell muffs the snap under center. He falls on the ball to limit it to just a one-yard loss.

8:54 p.m.: Raiders will start from their own 25 after a touchback.

8:51 p.m. Jets scoring play: Wilson threads the needle out to Garrett Wilson, but the receiver can't hang on. Tyler Conklin makes a quick grab for five yards, but the Jets again have to settle for three from Zuerlein. Jets 6, Raiders 3

8:49 p.m.: Now, Garrett Wilson's getting involved in the running game, taking an end around for 11 yards. However, C.J. Uzomah is called for holding that moves the play back to a second-and-18.

8:47 p.m.: Garrett Wilson gets back into the passing game, first catching a quick pass on the outside for five yards, then taking a short pass from Wilson up eight yards to the Raiders' 32 for another first down.

8:45 p.m.: After a pair of runs that picked up six yards from Hall, Wilson throws a deep pass out to Gipson down the right sideline, picking up 24 yards to the Raiders' 45. Jets again using big strikes to move down the field.

8:44 p.m.: Jets will start their second drive at their own 25 with 6:15 to go in the first quarter.

8:39 p.m. Raiders scoring play: That penalty winds up stunting the drive. Adams makes an impressive, one-handed grab for eight yards and Michael Mayer picks up seven on a grab over the middle, but he's stopped just short. The Raiders also settle for a field goal, this one from 41 yards out to even the game. Jets 3, Raiders 3

8:38 p.m.: Right after the big play, Adams is flagged for offensive pass interference on a swing pass to Jacobs. That will move the Raiders back, and bring up a first-and-20.

8:37 p.m.: Josh Jacobs' first carry is stuffed for only two. But the first big connection between O'Connell and Adams vaults the Raiders up to the Jets' 31 for 42 yards on a nice deep pass over the middle of the field.

Aidan O'Connell stumbled and still found Davante for 42 yards

8:35 p.m.: DeAndre Carter returns the kickoff to the Raiders' 25 to start the drive.

8:31 p.m. Jets scoring play: Dalvin Cook has an impressive seven-yard run, but on third down, Wilson's quick pass to Gipson is dropped. The Jets have to settle for three from Greg Zuerlein. Jets 3, Raiders 0

8:30 p.m.: Odd play after the explosive. Wilson is brought down, and as he's going down, he tries to flip the ball out. It initially looked like it could've been a fumble, but it is called for intentional grounding. That will bring up a second-and-20 for New York.

8:29 p.m.: On a play action, the Wilson-Wilson connection is an explosive one, as the receiver catches a hard pass over the middle and streaks down the right sideline before finally being brought down at the Raiders' 26 for a gain of 41.

8:28 p.m.: Zach Wilson to Garrett Wilson, with an impressive throw and catch threading the needle between a pair of defenders on the left side for six yards and a first down. Jets decline the offsides penalty on the Raiders.

8:27 p.m.: Breece Hall gets the call twice to start the drive and powers his way up the middle for four on the first run, then is stuffed for only a yard on the next play.

8:25 p.m.: O'Connell tries to feed Davante Adams to start the game. He misses Adams on the first drive, then connects with him for gains of six and three. Adams is tackled just shy of the line, however, and the Raiders have to punt. Xavier Gipson calls for a fair catch at the Jets' 22.

8:23 p.m.: The Raiders will start the game with the ball on offense, and will open at their own 25.

8:10 p.m.: Rodgers might be looking better and better each week. But no, he will not be playing against the Raiders tonight.

sports,News,2023-12-24T22:28:25+00:00,"Alyssa Healy has rejected any suggestion Australia’s stranglehold on international women’s cricket is slipping, saying their Test loss to India is barely a blip on the team’s record.

Australia stumbled to their first Test defeat to India by eight wickets in Mumbai on Sunday, after being outplayed by the hosts in foreign spinning conditions.

The loss comes after one of the more difficult periods for the Australian side in the past six years, with the retirements of Meg Lanning and Rachael Haynes.

After winning their fourth straight global ICC event earlier this year in the 50-over World Cup, Australia retained the Ashes via a drawn multi-format series in England in July.

That tour included losing four of six white-ball matches, with Australia’s win in the Test enough to have them level on points with England and hold onto the trophy.

The current tour of India is not a multi-format series, but the defeat in the one-off Test marks Australia’s first loss in a four-day game since January 2014.

But quizzed over whether the defeat suggested Australia’s unprecedented period of dominance was ending, Healy was defiant.

“It’s probably not even a blip,” Healy said.

“It (Test cricket) is a format where we’re not overly familiar with, in conditions that we’re not familiar with.

“I see more positives out of this and than any sort of negativity.

“There is always a lot of expectation and external noise about our team and how we’re performing.

“They are so used to seeing us winning, that I think, at times, they forget that we’ve actually seen quite a lot of change over the last 12 to 18 months.

“That kind of goes unnoticed external to our group.”

Australia have spoken about shifting their mindset in white-ball cricket after the losses in England, pursuing a more attacking approach.

Three looming ODIs against India in the next week and three ensuing T20s will be the first showing of that, with the hosts also a rising force in the white-ball game.

“Within our group we’re really comfortable with where we’re at, and the progression we’re on,” Healy said.

“Ultimately there’s a big T20 World Cup in Bangladesh towards the end of next year, that is a real carrot for us.

“These are the sort of big trophies that we’re wanting to win.

“And yes, every series in between now and then is important, but at the same time we’re building towards that World Cup.

“Maybe you can ask me that (supremacy) question at the end of the six white-ball games to see how we’re going and we can answer that.

“These next six games will probably give us a better indication about how we’re tracking but also what we might need to improve on.”

Healy called for Australia’s Test series in India to be extended to three matches their loss, their first in 11 Tests against India.

The hosts easily chased down 75 in the fourth innings on Sunday.

All out for 209 in their first innings, Australia looked far more confident in their second effort of 261 despite the wicket showing more signs of wear.

And Healy believes three-Test tours of India would provide a better match-up between the two sides.

“It would create a real contest over three games,” Healy said.

“That would be an unbelievable experience for our group, and probably a true test of of both sides’ abilities.

“The one-off Test, India playing in their home conditions, you’d expect them to be heavy favourites.

“But the way we tried to adapt and continue to learn throughout the four days was really impressive.

“We would love to have another crack at it, show what we learned and put it into practice.”

Healy is realistic in conceding her wish is unlikely to be granted.

The last women’s Test series of more than one match was way back in 2006, while India had not hosted any red-ball cricket for nine years before this summer.

“The nature of the female game at the moment is it’s very white-ball dominant,” Healy said.

“Trying to fit it all in to the calendar and fitting all the white-ball games in seems to take precedence.

“But you take three one-day games out, and we could probably play two more Test matches.”

Australia’s captain is also insistent this Test should have formed part of a multi-format series, in the same way most top-tier women’s tours are now conducted.

While one Test, three ODIs and three T20s will be played, each are individual contests rather than an overarching series in the same way the Ashes is decided.

Australia had taken the trophy used from the multi-format 2021-22 series against India to be contested, only to be told by authorities that system would not be used.

“I sit here disappointed that we couldn’t win the Test match,” Healy said.

“But at the end of the day, we weren’t necessarily playing for points, we weren’t playing for overall series points for a trophy.

“It does make it a little bit of a novelty in a sense.

“The fact that it sort of feels meaningless to a sense is really disappointing to me. But in saying that we are disappointed that we couldn’t get ourselves over the line.”

The NBA is home to the world’s best basketball players and teams, with it being the pinnacle of the sport. Throughout its history, iconic figures like Magic Johnson, Larry Bird, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, and Michael Jordan have left an indelible mark on the league. However, for the better part of the past two decades, players like Stephen Curry, LeBron James and Kevin Durant have dominated the NBA landscape. Their otherworldly talents have continuously captivated the fans across the globe. While LeBron James and Stephen Curry may have accumulated more championships and accolades, Kevin Durant, without a doubt, is universally acknowledged as the best pure talent of his generation.

America’s Favorite Video Today

Kevin Durant stands as one of the most exceptionally skilled players in NBA history. Across his illustrious 17-year career in the league, Durant has solidified his status as a transcendent superstar. His stellar performances over the years have endeared him to millions of fans. However, even with his exceptional talents, Kevin Durant regularly faces disregard from both the media and fans. This has made KD one of the most polarizing figures in basketball. Yet, when one considers the profound impact Durant has made on the NBA, the extent of the disrespect he encounters can seem perplexing at times.

What makes Kevin Durant so polarising?

It would be an understatement to say that Kevin Durant divides opinions. While some view him as the most skilled basketball player of his generation, others perceive him as a diva who rode the coattails of Stephen Curry to secure his two NBA championships. However, a careful consideration of Kevin Durant’s game-changing impact and the multitude of accolades he has garnered throughout his illustrious career reveals a glaring reality: KD stands as perhaps the most disrespected icon of the sport.

Kevin Durant rose to prominence in 2007, when the Seattle SuperSonics drafted him with the No.2 pick. The NBA had never witnessed a player possessing Durant’s unique skill set—a 6’11” forward renowned for his exceptional jump-shot and lethal three-point accuracy. He epitomized the concept of a “Unicorn” in its truest sense.

Moreover, when one pays close attention to his stats, the disrespect becomes even more perplexing. Kevin Durant has amassed 27,393 points in the regular season, ranking 11th in NBA history. In the playoffs, he has contributed an additional 4,878 points, placing him 7th on the all-time list. Durant is a surefire future first-ballot Hall of Famer, boasting an illustrious resume that few can match. His accomplishments include two NBA titles, two NBA finals MVP awards, four scoring titles, and multiple selections to the All-Star and All-NBA teams.

Durant’s scuffles with critics

While Durant may rank among the greatest NBA players in history, his vulnerability to criticism and thin-skinned nature has, on several occasions, has got the better of him. NBA legend Charles Barkley called Durant “sensitive” in an interview with 60 Minutes. He said, “He’s very sensitive. Great player. He’s part of that generation who thinks he can’t be criticized.”

Durant’s susceptibility to criticism became glaringly evident when he utilized a burner account in 2017 to defend himself on Twitter. However, Durant was exposed when he inadvertently failed to switch accounts, posting a tweet through his verified account. Fans also criticize KD for his lack of leadership and his lack of titles since departing from the Warriors. Since his departure in 2019, Durant has not secured an NBA title. Despite forming a formidable trio with Kyrie Irving and James Harden in Brooklyn, their best result was a second-round exit in the 2021 playoffs at the hands of the Milwaukee Bucks.

Fans and media strongly disapprove of Kevin Durant’s inclination to switch teams repeatedly, even when he receives substantial support from the organizations. After his Brooklyn experiment didn’t work, KD requested a trade and, on last year’s trade deadline, his wish was granted as the Nets traded him to the Suns. Despite having NBA stars like Devin Booker and Chris Paul as teammates, Durant once again fell short of winning a title with the Suns. Durant’s inability to clinch an NBA title without Curry and the Warriors has heightened the narrative that questions his status as an icon of the game.

The decision that tainted Durant’s legacy

In the 2016 Western Conference finals, KD-Russ led OKC Thunder faced off against 73-9 Warriors. After swiftly securing a 3-1 series lead, the Thunder seemed poised for an NBA Finals appearance. However, the Warriors orchestrated a remarkable comeback, ultimately winning the series in seven games. This meant that Durant would go trophy-less for another season.

In the 2016 offseason, Durant made a pivotal decision to join the very team that had defeated him in the finals. This move had profound consequences, leading to a shift in public opinion, with many labeling him as a “snake” and “spineless.” While Durant achieved the success he craved for in the Bay Area, his decision to join the Warriors has permanently cast a shadow on his legacy.

sports,Nilavro Ghosh,2023-09-28T21:31:48+00:00,"Despite being a full-blown title contender in the NASCAR Cup Series, Kyle Larson manages to run a pretty successful Sprint Car Series. The Hendrick Motorsports driver is the co-owner of the High Limits Racing Sprint Car Series, along with four-time World of Outlaws Series champion and brother-in-law Brad Sweet. The venture by the two motorsports athletes has been a success so far, and recently, one of their races pulled an extraordinary crowd, which included a rather popular figure in the world of motorsports, Dale Earnhardt Jr.

America’s Favorite Video Today

Junior was present at High Limit Racing’s Commonwealth Clash at the Lernerville Speedway on Tuesday. He and Brad Sweet used to have a working relationship, as the latter used to be a development driver for JR Motorsports in the NASCAR Nationwide Series. As per Larson, it was the former Cup Series driver who had requested a visit to the event and had also urged Kyle Larson to take part in the race, which he obliged. The 49-year-old was quite happy with his experience after the event, but before the action started, he conducted an interview with Larson and Sweet, where he asked about the origins of the competition.

Kyle Larson explains his goal of “adding pressure” to his competition

ADVERTISEMENT Article continues below this ad

Larson has always been a fan of sprint car racing, so it really is no surprise that he decided to start a competition involving sprint cars. What is surprising is how he gets the time to look after his Cup Series title run and the competition at the same time. It really is quite commendable that he has been able to turn High Limits Racing into the success that it is today.

Speaking about how everything started with him and Brad Sweet, Kyle Larson said, “Well, you’ve always talked about having a series that’s solely based around me or whatever, and I didn’t really want that, you know. I wanted to help out the other racers really, and you know I got to. Really, my eyes opened to starting this deal when I started racing the late model, and you know, FloRacing has their Tuesday night late model series and, you know, pays 20 some thousand to win every Tuesday, and I was like, Why wouldn’t that work in sprint cars?”

While others in Larson’s position might have felt that being the owner of a competition would be too challenging to focus on their racing career, the Hendrick Motorsports driver welcomed it with open arms. He saw a business opportunity ripe for the taking, took his shot, and hit the mark.

The series obviously helps out both Sweet and Larson financially, given the fan following it has garnered, but it is also quite profitable for the drivers and the teams. The winning driver, who in this case was David Gravel, wins $50,000, and with crowds so big, it helps out the teams with merchandise sales.

Events like these also help to keep these smaller race tracks across the country in good shape. If a track isn’t used or taken care of for an extended period of time, it will start to wear out and eventually become completely unsuitable for any kind of racing unless it is taken apart and rebuilt. But one of Kyle Larson’s reasons for doing what he does with the High Limits Racing Sprint Car Series is a lot simpler, and he revealed that goal to Dale Earnhardt Jr. at the Lernerville Speedway.

“I was hoping this would add pressure to the weekend shows to raise their purses as well so I think we’ve seen a big step in that this year and I think it’s gonna continue forward so, I would say so far it’s been successful,” he added. Kyle Larson had taken part in the Lernerville race on Tuesday, only a couple of days after a hectic race in Texas, and it seems like he had brought some of that form into the dirt track race because he made a slightly similar mistake.

Cup Series hopeful has Texas deja vu at Lernerville

With just nine laps to the checkered flag, Kyle Larson was leading the race and seemed to take the victory and earn himself $50,000 in his own competition. However, much like what happened in Texas, Larson lost control of his car as he was trying to defend the lead of the race from co-owner Brad Sweet.

Unlike Texas, he did not DNF and managed to get his car back on track, but his chance to win had gone. The Cup Series HMS driver could only finish in eighth place. A racer as competitive as Larson would have liked a win, especially after what had happened the Sunday before, but it was a good day for him as the owner as well.

The 2021 Cup Series champion is in the prime of his career and has a lot of years left ahead of him in NASCAR, but when he decides to hang up his boots, he will hope that the High Limits Racing Sprint Cup Series achieves a high level of national popularity and he will not have to take himself out of the racing business.

sports,Kyle Bonn,2023-10-06T20:56:33+00:00,"With the United States set to test themselves against one of Europe's most powerful sides, the opponents are entering a transitional phase as well.

Germany are considered one of the preeminent national team programs in the world, but recent years have humbled Die Mannschaft. They have been eliminated in the group stage of two straight World Cup tournaments, an unthinkable slip in stature given they had never been bounced from any World Cup that early in history prior to 2018.

With Hansi Flick unable to steer the team to safer waters in Qatar, Julian Nagelsmann has taken over as new Germany head coach.

At just 36 years old, Nagelsmann is a rising star, having spent three successful seasons at Hoffenheim followed by two years at RB Leipzig, which catapulted him to the managerial post at Bayern Munich in 2021. He steered the Bavarian giants to the Bundesliga title in his first season, but he was sacked by the club in March of 2023 amidst a furious league title fight.

Nagelsmann's dismissal at Bayern Munich came as a shock to much of the European football landscape, as the club had performed exceptionally in the Champions League and was still very much in the title race, sitting just a point behind Dortmund. Now, with a chance for redemption at the helm of the national team, Nagelsmann will see his time begin with a friendly against the United States.

Germany squad, players for USA friendly

Julian Nagelsmann will be very familiar with much of the 26-man German national team squad, as five players hail from his former club Bayern Munich, including critical midfield duo Josh Kimmich and Leon Goretzka, who were instrumental in his setup at Allianz Arena.

Along the back, Nagelsmann has oddly selected five center-backs compared to just two natural full-backs in David Raum and Robin Gosens, both left-sided players, possibly indicating a desire to play a three-CB system, although it's hard to know for sure as Nagelsmann preferred a 4-2-3-1 for much of his club managerial career.

One of the center-backs present in the squad is Mats Hummels, who has not been called in since 2021 and dropped for the entirety of Hansi Flick's time in charge. This came at the expense of Hummels' Borussia Dortmund teammate Nico Schlotterbeck.

First national team call-ups were handed to Kevin Behrens of Union Berlin, Chris Fuhrich of Stuttgart, and Robert Andrich of Bayer Leverkusen. There's a choice for Nagelsmann to make up front, as Niklas Fullkrug has been prolific in his short national team stint, but Thomas Muller is an experienced veteran who is still performing at a high level.

Injuries for Nagelsmann to work around include Serge Gnabry who is out with a broken arm, and Timo Werner who has been touch and go at RB Leipzig with a back problem.

Germany predicted starting lineup vs. USA (4-2-3-1): ter Stegen (GK) — Kimmich, Rudiger, Sule, Raum — Gundogan, Goretzka — Sane, Musiala, Brandt — Fullkrug.

Julian Nagelsmann tactics, style of play

Through his time at Bayern Munich, Julian Nagelsmann preferred a 4-2-3-1 formation with Joshua Kimmich and Leon Goretzka holding down the lynchpin central midfield spots.

However, as the 2022/23 season progressed and results weren't as easy to come by, Nagelsmann switched to a 3-2-4-1 formation. This allowed him to deploy the likes of Alphonso Davies and Kingsley Coman very high up the pitch to provide width, while letting Jamal Musiala and Thomas Muller cook centrally behind a striker.

That 3-2-4-1 formation is flexible horizontally, as it allows one full-back to push high up the pitch while the other slots in along the back line, and thus sees the two central No. 10 players alternate pushing wide or pinching in to compensate.

This tactical setup is becoming popular with top-tier coaches across Europe, and has been used at various stages by the likes of Pep Guardiola, Stefano Pioli, Mikel Arteta, Edin Terzic, and many others.

In either setup, the forward line will shift horizontally to allow a midfield player to drive into space, and given options once halted to either play into the crowded forward line or release a bombing full-back to the off side, both of which can stretch or confuse an opponent's defensive unit.

Having spent time in the Red Bull system, Nagelsmann also deploys a complicated press that, like Gregg Berhalter, starts with the lone central striker. The goal is to force the opponent to play the ball into overload traps out wide, or if the opponent plays centrally, a defensive midfielder would step up at the base of a diamond (with two midfielders on the sides and the striker at the top) which would overwhelm an opposition midfield trio.

How will Germany play under Julian Nagelsmann?

The question, now, is how all this will translate to the German national team.

Looking at Julian Nagelsmann's first squad of 26 players, the biggest question is which formation he will play. There are no natural right-backs on the roster, meaning he will either have to pidgeonhole a center-back (Antonio Rudiger or Niklas Sule) out wide, sacrifice Josh Kimmich's presence in midfield to move him back, or move Pascal Gross back. None of those are ideal options.

Whether Nagelsmann deploys a 4-2-3-1 or a 3-2-4-1, the tactical approach will likely remain the same.

Getting the best out of young superstar Jamal Musiala will be one of the most important aspects of Nagelsmann's tenure, as Musiala has blossomed into a world-class talent at Bayern Munich, but the 20-year-old has just one goal in 23 international caps to this point.

Nagelsmann will also look to introduce a few overlooked players, starting with Robert Andrich who could factor into the midfield setup as a traditional No. 6, especially as Ilkay Gundogan enters the twilight of his career. The new boss will also want to raise Kimmich's level of play back to old heights, as the ever-present Bayern star has seen his level drop in recent years for both club and country but remains a special talent.

Germany criticized for travel schedule vs USA, Mexico

The DFB has taken significant flak from the German press for their travel to North America to play the United States and Mexico.

There's likely some form of superiority complex involved, with those following the German national team surely miffed that a European giant is traveling across the globe to meet CONCACAF sides with far thinner World Cup resumes. However, a closer look at their travel schedule does invite some questions as to how they've made use of the international break.

Most notably, the Germany squad will return to Europe just a single day prior to Borussia Dortmund's first match out of the break, which sees BVB play Werder Bremen on Friday, October 20. Bayern Munich have their first game back against Mainz on Saturday, as does much of the Bundesliga.

""I don't know if I'd be interested in playing against Mexico in America before [the Euros hosted] in Germany,"" said Bayern Munich manager Thomas Tuchel prior to the international break. ""I don't know if anyone can explain this in a way that I can understand. I don't know who decided it, but it has been decided.

""There is a difference between a busy schedule and everything away from home and in different time zones. This is at the end of the endurance. No coach in the world at this level will say otherwise.""

""I don't understand the trip to the USA — for a variety of reasons,"" said former Germany international Lothar Matthaus to German outlet Bild back in the summer. ""I would have tried to create a good atmosphere in Germany before the Euros. That's why I would be in all 10 European Championship stadiums for the friendly matches and would have shown myself there once as a DFB selection. That can create a mood. But what do we want in the US at this point?""","What USMNT can expect from Julian Nagelsmann, Germany in first match for new manager",https://www.sportingnews.com/us/soccer/news/usmnt-expect-julian-nagelsmann-germany-first-match-manager/555946aa00b634dde90e3052,Sporting News

Cole Palmer is a man on the move, from Manchester City to Chelsea, from perennial substitute to pivotal starter, from England Under-21 player to, perhaps, a senior international. It has been a few months of swift change. He is trying to get used to new surroundings, having swapped south Manchester – in his native Wythenshawe – for the South.

“The most annoying thing? The traffic, that’s the biggest thing for me. Everything else I am enjoying. It is hotter than Manchester as well,” he said. Certainly Palmer feels hot property right now, albeit while exhibiting a certain coolness. He was calm enough to score an injury-time penalty for his new club against his old on Sunday, completing a 4-4 draw, and cheeky enough to poke his head into a City huddle when they were lining up a free-kick, to the amusement of Erling Haaland.

Perhaps it summed up Palmer’s inability to feel intimidated by anything that he marked his goal against City with a shrug. There was no getting carried away. “I spent 15 years at the club,” he noted. “I can’t really go and celebrate how I would celebrate if I have scored a 95th-minute equaliser because it would have been disrespectful.”

The alternative explanation is that Palmer has scored so many major goals in the last few months that this was merely another. He struck in the Community Shield and the European Super Cup for City, against Arsenal and Tottenham for Chelsea. That big-match temperament may equip him for tournament football in an England shirt. So, too, his nerveless penalty-taking.

Palmer in training at St George’s Park this week (PA)

He has, in effect, anointed himself as the spot-kick taker for the £1bn team, taking the ball at Turf Moor to open his Chelsea account. “It was just an in-game thing, really,” he said, with a matter-of-fact stance. “Once I scored at Burnley, I just thought: ‘I’ll take them’.” If penalties have been the English disease, Palmer has no hesitation when asked if he would be willing to come off the bench as a specialist from 12 yards for a shootout. “Yeah, I would be,” he said.

He is not daunted by the last penalty he missed, as a substitute in the shootout when City lost the 2019 FA Youth Cup final to Liverpool. He can only remember failing from 12 yards on one other occasion, “when I was dead, dead young versus [Manchester] United,” and a willingness to take responsibility is similarly apparent in open play. “I think I am a player who always wants the ball, anywhere, to try and help the team get out of a difficult situation or create a chance,” he said.

If he has created an opportunity for himself with his country because of his excellence at Stamford Bridge, it had not formed part of his thinking. “I wasn’t even thinking of an England call-up when I first went to Chelsea,” he said.

Nor, indeed, was it on his agenda as a boy, when his mother banned him from playing in the garden. “I was always breaking her pipes,” he recalled. He has come a long way since then; particularly in 2023. “Yeah, it’s been crazy,” he said. “The changes have happened so fast. From winning the Euros to signing for Chelsea then getting signed up here.”

Palmer chats with Arsenal winger Bukayo Saka (The FA/Getty)

His part in England Under-21s’ European Championship win may have caught Gareth Southgate’s eye. His immediate decision was whether he had done enough to impress Pep Guardiola. There had been interest in taking him on loan, from Brighton and Burnley and RB Leipzig. City decided that he could only leave on a permanent deal and Chelsea forked out £42.5m. “Who knows what would have happened if I had stayed?” Palmer mused. “Maybe I would have played more, maybe not. But I think the decision to go to Chelsea so far is paying off.”

That is an understatement. And if there seemed a risk involved in swapping the stability of City for the seeming madhouse of Stamford Bridge, there was evidence of more cool-headed thinking from a 21-year-old. Chelsea have been manic buyers but he said: “I did look at how many players were there but I don’t think people realise how many players they actually got rid off, as well.”

The departures of, among others, Mason Mount, Kai Havertz, Christian Pulisic and Joao Felix, meant there could be opportunities in the attacking midfield positions. “I looked at the squad and thought: ‘If I go there and know what I can do then I’ll have the chance of playing’,” he said. “And thankfully it’s happened.” If there seemed plenty of traffic in the queue for places in Southgate’s attack, Palmer seems to have accelerated past several rivals.

sports,Brian Campbell,2023-11-25T21:30:43+00:00,"When two great fighters have been avoided by top opponents for so long, it inevitably makes sense for them to fight one another in order to get to the top.

That's the working theory being undertaken by former two-division champion Demetrius Andrade (32-0, 19 KOs), who has spent most of his career doing the unfruitful chasing of big names like Canelo Alvarez, Gennadiy Golovkin and Jermall Charlo.

Andrade, 35, will finally get his shot at the super elite, and potential recognition among the pound-for-pound best in the sport, when he faces former two-time super middleweight titleholder David Benavidez (27-0, 23 KOs) on Saturday in a 168-pound clash at the Michelob Ultra Arena at Mandalay Bay in Las Vegas (Showtime PPV, 8 p.m. ET).

""Fighters don't want to fight but I'm glad David has nowhere to go,"" Andrade told CBS Sports last month. ""It only makes sense to fight me.""

Fresh off a resounding decision win over former champion Caleb Plant in their March PPV clash, the 26-year-old Benavidez, who was born in Arizona to parents of Mexican and Ecuadorian descent, has seemingly been hand-picked by boxing's foundational Mexican-American fan base as the eventual successor to Alvarez.

Benavidez, like Andrade, is hoping a breakthrough victory against such a tricky opponent will be the final rung on the ladder that needs to be climbed before finally getting the call to challenge Alvarez for his four-pack of world titles in the division.

""To be honest, I don't know what that man is doing,"" Benavidez told ""Morning Kombat"" last month when asked about Alvarez. ""I feel like every time I say something, people say that I'm just looking for a payday. I have been the mandatory fighter for the past two years. I won the title eliminator first and then the WBC interim, which guarantees you a spot. So, the fact that the fight hasn't happened is really crazy to me.

""This man is just making it worse for himself because I am gaining so much experience. I'm getting very comfortable and I'm not going nowhere. As soon as I get in the ring with Canelo, all of those belts will come to me.""

Don't let the ambitious hopes of both fighters and their collective lust for one day sharing the ring with boxing's biggest star as a means to suggest they are overlooking one another.

Benavidez may have previously been his own biggest enemy throughout a career that saw him become the youngest champion at 20 in divisional history back in 2017 only for him to twice be stripped of his WBC title (once for a failed drug test for cocaine and a second time mid-pandemic for missing weight). But the maturity he has shown in recent years has been noteworthy, as was the performance he put together against Plant where Benavidez entered in top physical shape and simply wore his smaller opponent out over 12 rounds.

""I'm trying to prove to the world that I'm the best super middleweight on this planet,"" Benavidez said. ""I'm going to definitely show that because I have had a tremendous training camp. I have been working for three months already and have been getting some great rounds of sparring. And this is the final Showtime [pay-per-view] so we have to go out with a bang.

""These are the type of fights that interest me because Demetrius Andrade is a great fighter, no doubt about that. But I get to test my heart and test my spirit in front of everybody. I know that when people make me reach deep down, the best of myself comes out. So, we are looking forward to this.""

What makes this matchup so interesting is that Andrade, a 2008 U.S. Olympian from Rhode Island, is the kind of Swiss army knife boxer whose colorful personality has never been able to offset the fact that opponents have always looked at him as high risk and low reward.

Andrade is a lengthy southpaw who relies on speed and guile to awkwardly navigate the center of the ring without paying for the real estate thanks to his elite defensive skills. But to try and suggest this fight has been a long-time coming for Andrade would be an insult to just how difficult his professional journey has been as it relates to trying to attract big-name opponents.

Although Andrade has looked great earning respectable wins at 154 and 160 pounds against the likes of Vanes Martirosyan, Brian Rose, Willie Nelson, Jack Culcay and Maciej Sulecki, the big names have routinely avoided him. Throughout the process, Andrade has also found himself perpetually stuck in promotional Siberia and admits to having considered walking away multiple times due to frustration.

All of that appeared to change upon his signing with top advisor Al Haymon's Premier Boxing Champions in late 2022. What followed was a wide decision win over Demond Nicholson in his super middleweight debut in January, on the undercard of the Gervonta Davis-Hector Luis Garcia PPV card, which set up an opportunity to face Benavidez once it was clear Alvarez wouldn't be part of his 2023 plans.

""People have avoided me and have not wanted to fight [but] if you put the very best in front of me, I'm going to be the very best and I'm going to elevate,"" Andrade said. ""That's just what it is."" I did throw my hands up at one point because of the situation that I was in. Clearly, it was not working out and there needed to be a separation here and a divorce. That has been pretty much what I have had to do in order to be in this position where I am today.

""This is more in my hands now. There are no obligations to a manager or a promoter. I do have a solid team that I trust and work with but nothing is on paper. Free at last, free at last. Thank ole, almighty God that I am free at last.""

Andrade might be more well known for his ability to hit and not get hit but that hasn't stopped him from declaring his willingness to defeat Benavidez under any means possible, even if that leads him to stand in front of Benavidez and trade.

It's a prospect that Benavidez would prefer, of course, although he is well prepared to do the chasing if he has to, similar to how he broke down Plant eight months ago.

""If he is going to give me a war then I'm looking forward to it because I'm a warrior and I can't wait to go in there,"" Benavidez said. ""The way I go into every fight is to think that every opponent is going to be the best that they can be. He's a slick boxer so I am expecting him to be at his best but this is what I have done for a long time. I love figuring guys out and I have hurt everyone that I have been in the ring with.

""I am the smarter fighter and I am the faster and hungrier fighter.""

Andrade said he doesn't expect Benavidez to be anything but in the best shape of his career this weekend but wants to make one thing clear to critics and/or oddsmakers, including those who have installed him as a 3-1 underdog: He is not Caleb Plant.

""Listen, people definitely get up for Michael Jordan, you know? So, I would assume [Benavidez] would get up to fight myself,"" Andrade said. ""But I'm not Caleb Plant, in no way, shape or form. There are sayings out there that we fight a like because we both box but we do not fight alike. I get to put all of my own questions out there and get my answers, as well. It will be my time to get up there and let the A game of Demetrius Andrade come out. I haven't been able to bring that out [in a while]. This will be two cats fighting each other rather than one cat fighting a mouse.""

The other fight of note on Saturday marks the return of WBC middleweight champion Jermall Charlo when he takes on Jose Benavidez Jr., the older brother of David Benavidez. Charlo has been out of action since June 2021 as he has dealt with out-of-ring issues with his family and his own mental health. Now, he looks to knock off the ring rust when he takes on Benavidez Jr. in a 10-round non-title bout. Benavidez Jr. picked up his first win in five years in August.

Let's take a closer look at the rest of the undercard before getting to a prediction and expert pick on the main event.

Prediction

Those who have followed Andrade's career close enough will realize that he does have the skill set to pull off the upset. The biggest questions surround whether he can take the kind of pounding that Benavidez's downhill style unleashes, especially in the second half when ""The Mexican Monster"" seems to only get stronger.

One of the most underrated aspects of Benavidez's game is how deft he can be blocking or avoiding counter fire while operating at close range and trading punches. While most would expect Andrade to rely on his footwork in the first half, he will need to be certain that he's banking enough rounds before Benavidez's inevitable mid-fight adjustment kicks in and his pressure increases.

Andrade's power is more of the accumulative kind over the course of rounds and not of the one-punch variety, which will make it difficult to dissuade Benavidez from coming forward. And that's the key to potentially bringing an edge with you to the ring against him because Benavidez's style is so fan and judge friendly as a come-forward attacker that it's difficult to bank close rounds against him because he's not only typically the busier fighter, he's also the one landing the majority of the power shots.

If Andrade can't hurt Benavidez or confuse him so thoroughly that it forces him away from his game plan, the best he can hope for is a moral victory of going the distance as Benavidez takes one massive step closer to the Alvarez bout which will likely define his pro career.

sports,David Suggs,2023-12-17T23:05:13+00:00,"The renaissance continues for Buccaneers quarterback Baker Mayfield.

The veteran hurler has enjoyed quite the campaign in 2024, turning back the clock with ruthless efficiency while leading Tampa Bay to the top of the NFC South totem pole.

Mayfield has quietly emerged as one of the league's best passers this year, entering the Bucs' Week 15 matchup with the Packers with a hair under 3,000 yards and 20 touchdowns to just eight interceptions.

He kept the good times rolling on Sunday, shredding Joe Barry's Packers defense to keep the Bucs strumming along towards a divisional crown with a 34-20 win.

Mayfield completed 22 of 28 passes (78.6%) for 381 yards and four touchdowns to lead Tampa Bay to glory over its intra-conference rivals. It was the finest display of Mayfield's season and one of the best of his career. It's also one of the greatest showings in recent Lambeau Field history; according to ESPN Stats and Info, Mayfield is just the sixth opposing QB to toss for at least 350 yards and four touchdowns in a single game there.

Per @ESPNStatsInfo, Baker Mayfield is the sixth visiting QB throw for 350 yards and four TDs at Lambeau Field all time. Kirk Cousins (2018) was the last to do it. — Rob Demovsky (@RobDemovsky) December 17, 2023

Mayfield has shown off his arm talent in years past. He's hit the 300-yard mark on 12 separate occasions. He's also showcased inch-perfect precision, having completed at least 75% of his passes 10 other times.

He's rarely done so together, though. Nor has he provided such a viable scoring punch in those matchups: Sunday represents just the fourth time Mayfield has ever notched at least four touchdown throws.

It was just the sort of act that the Buccaneers were craving. And it means so much more for Mayfield, a player whose time in the spotlight looked to be waning just one year ago.

With that, let's take a closer examination of Mayfield's one shining moment against Green Bay.

Baker Mayfield stats today

In many ways, Mayfield's Week 15 masterpiece was one of the most impressive of his career. He turned the frozen tundra into a canvas, splattering all sorts of different colors on it while taking brief respites to admire his work. Mayfield finished the day with 381 passing yards, four passing scores and a 78.6% completion percentage.

In terms of individual days, it was a career one for Mayfield. He recorded the second-most single-game yard and second-most single-game touchdown totals of his professional career. And he did all this against a side fighting tooth and nail with Tampa for a playoff spot.

Mayfield did the brunt of his damage against zone coverage, whipping arrows beyond the Packers secondary time and time again. Per Next Gen Stats, Mayfield was 20-of-24 for 361 yards and three touchdowns against zone.

He also became the first player in seven years to complete a touchdown pass in all four levels of the field (line of scrimmage, 1-10 yards, 11-20 yards, 20+ yards).

Baker Mayfield completed 20 of 24 passes against zone coverage for 361 yards & 3 TD in the Buccaneers 34-20 victory over the Packers.

The film told a similar story. Mayfield looked composed in the pocket, letting loose as he slung the hazel-tinted chamber in all sorts of different directions. He hit that much-vaunted 158.3 perfect passer rating, becoming the first visiting quarterback to ever record such a mark at Lambeau. And he did so in style, whipping whistlers beyond Green Bay surveillance with a variety of targets. Five different Buccaneers wide receivers recorded at least 40 receiving yards on the day.

Chris Godwin was Mayfield's favorite battery mate. He caught 10 passes for 155 yards, by far his best showing of the year. But even when Godwin wasn't open, Mayfield got creative. Whether it was Mike Evans, Rachaad White, David Moore or even Ko Kieft, it seemed that whenever Mayfield wanted someone to get the ball, he got it to them without a hint of discomfort.

Perfect day in Green Bay for Baker Mayfield.

He sparkled at the league's most hallowed ground. And in the process, he made a bit of league history. Mayfield is one of just three QBs to throw for 375+ yards and four touchdown passes while recording a perfect passer rating away from home. The other two? Nick Foles in 2014 and Ken O'Brien in 1986.

In today's @Buccaneers win, @bakermayfield became the 3rd QB in @NFL history with 375+ passing yards (381), 4+ TD passes (4) & a 158.3 passer rating - the highest attainable mark - in a road game.

Not bad for an undersized sidewinder who looked to be approaching the end of his rope as a starting QB one year prior.

sports,Crissy Froyd,2023-12-24T23:00:03+00:00,"The Christmas Eve showdown between the Patriots and the Broncos was expected to be a solid victory by Denver against a team that had won just three games heading into the contest. It was anything but that.

In a game that it had it all between critical turnovers and scores that came down to the final minute, Patriots kicker Chad Ryland hit a 56-yard field goal to send the Patriots to a 26-23 victory.

Coming into this game, New England had played the Chiefs tough but lost at home to fall to 3-11 and improve its chances of landing the No. 1 pick in next year's draft. Denver aimed to get back to the right side of the win column after getting blown out by the Lions in an all-around abysmal performance.

MORE: Chad Ryland redeems himself with game-winning field goal

In this one, it took the Broncos a while once more to put points on the board, with 16 of them coming in the fourth quarter in a comeback effort that proved just a hit too late.

Broncos quarterback Russell Wilson had seemed to be experiencing a bit of a resurgence in his first year playing under head coach Sean Payton, but there have continued to be some ups and downs. Wilson finished out this one 25-of-37 for 238 yards with two touchdowns.

He faced a Patriots defense that is among the better ones in the league, hardly like its offense has been for the better part of the year. The offense ranked 28th in the league heading into the game. However, the Patriots had one of their better showings on that side of the ball as they totaled 289 yards with 23 points.

The Broncos' loss puts their playoff hopes on ice at 7-8, though Denver isn't formally eliminated quite yet. The Patriots moved to 4-11 but hurt their draft positioning in the process.

sports,Ian Chadband,2023-11-24T23:10:22+00:00,"The second of Sinner’s Djokovic victories came in Italy’s impressive Davis Cup semi-final triumph over Serbia, after saving three consecutive match points on serve, before besting the world No.1 again in the doubles. World No.4 Sinner, coached by Australia’s Darren Cahill, is the first player to topple Djokovic twice in the same season since Russia’s Daniil Medvedev in 2019. Italian teammates Lorenzo Sonego and Jannik Sinner will face Australia in the Davis Cup final. Credit: Getty However, if Popyrin can get the job done in the No.2 singles then Australia will, at minimum, reach the doubles with a live chance, and a good one, with 2022 Wimbledon champions Max Purcell and Matt Ebden to be unleashed. The query is whether Italian captain Filippo Volandri will turn to Lorenzo Musetti, who battled a leg issue at the end of his three-set loss to Serbia’s Miomir Kecmanovic, or one of Lorenzo Sonego or Matteo Arnaldi.

Popyrin won his only ATP Tour clash with Musetti – who has been as high as No.15 in the world – in a tight two-setter at last year’s Miami Masters, but the emerging Italian claimed three of their four showdowns at the next level down. He is yet to play against Sonego, who Arthurs expects to play. “I’m assuming they will back in Popyrin because he played pretty well a couple of nights ago, and with his firepower – he’s probably the key to the tie,” Arthurs said. “He’s showing all the signs of becoming a top-25 player in the next couple of years. His junior career suggested he was going to be a very good player, and it’s unusual for someone to win the junior French Open and not go on to something big. Alexei Popyrin celebrates with Australian captain Lleyton Hewitt after his Davis Cup win. Credit: Getty Images “These moments can be a big springboard for someone like Alexei. He’s a confidence player, and this is a very big moment – whoever he plays, Musetti or Sonego. But he’s got to go out and embrace the moment, and he’s the type of player who will enjoy it.

“I’d love to give de Minaur a chance with his fighting abilities, but the way Sinner has played the last six months, you’d have to say Sinner is the favourite.” Loading Hewitt animatedly embraced Popyrin after his straight-sets victory over 171st-ranked Finn Otto Virtanen, but Australia’s Davis Cup captain would be even more thrilled if he could repeat the dose against Italy. Australia could also turn to an alternative No.2 singles option, with Jordan Thompson and Purcell waiting in the wings. “It’s everybody’s dream to play for their country,” Popyrin said. “I looked up to Lleyton, looked up to all the older Aussie legends. To be able to put on the green and gold, to be able to go out there and play for your country, no matter the format, if it’s this Davis Cup or the old Davis Cup, you give your all.

“It’s nerves, it’s pressure – you’re playing for everybody back home. It’s something that nothing will ever compare to ... it really was the biggest moment of my career to get the first live rubber win, to get one foot into the final. It was something that I’ll never forget.” Loading Australia, who lost last year’s final to Canada, has enjoyed a soft run on paper to this year’s decider, eliminating the Czech Republic and Finland – with neither country boasting a top-30 singles player – but will have earned their 29th Davis Cup title if they account for Italy. Canada defeated Italy in the Davis Cup round-robin matches in September, but bowed out to Finland in the knockout stage without Felix Auger-Aliassime and Denis Shapovalov, who have both battled injury and form. The final is due to start at 2am AEDT on Monday and will be broadcast on 9GEM.

Sinner ends Djoker’s Davis Cup dream Novak Djokovic’s dream of capping his great season by blasting Serbia past Australia in the Davis Cup final was blown up by Jannik Sinner’s extraordinary double triumph over the world No.1. Instead, in the Davis Cup final in Malaga, Australia will face an Italy team running hot on the heroics of their golden boy Sinner, who beat Djokovic in both the singles and the doubles in the space of five exhilarating hours in their semi-final on Saturday (Sunday AEDT). Jannik Sinner saved three match points before going on to beat Novak Djokovic. Credit: Getty Images In one of the great Davis Cup rubbers, Djokovic had held three match points against Sinner and was on the verge of a completing a relatively workaday 2-0 victory for the Serbs.

But for only the fourth time in his unparalleled career, Djokovic was beaten from match-point up as Sinner roared back to complete his second victory over the master in just 12 days, winning 6-2, 2-6, 7-5. The 22-year-old Sinner, by now an irresistible force, then re-emerged to team up with Lorenzo Sonego and spray massive forehand winners around liberally as they outplayed a by now weary-looking Djokovic and Miomir Kecmanovic 6-3, 6-4. Djokovic had three match points in the singles rubber. Credit: Getty Images It was a crushing end to Djokovic’s hopes of ending his triumphant season, which has featured three grand slam victories and an ATP finals showdown victory over Sinner just six days ago, with a second Davis Cup title. After telling fans to “shut up” earlier in the week, he again got irritated with the crowd in the doubles, pretending to be the conductor to the Italian fans’ deafening chorus, but though he may be the greatest player who ever picked up a racquet, doubles looks an alien game to him.

His serve was broken in the first set and his court positioning left a big hole for Sinner to blast his forehand through the world No.1 and Kecmanovic, who had earlier worn down Lorenzo Musetti 6-7 (7-9), 6-2, 6-1 in the tie’s opening singles. The tie, though, will forever be remembered for Sinner’s comeback triumph in their third brilliant singles duel in less than a fortnight. This time, the Sinner of the Turin group stages re-emerged, the young titan reprising his victory of 12 days ago when he became the only man since Djokovic’s Wimbledon final loss to Carlos Alcaraz to defeat the 24-time grand slam champion. Here he did something even more astonishing when, after soaking up immense pressure throughout the deciding set, he stared at 0-40 on his serve at 4-5. Yet the 22-year-old proved absolutely nerveless, firing down an ace to save the third of the three match points, and then immediately turning the tables by breaking Djokovic in the very next game amid wild Italian celebrations in the stands at the Palacio de deportes Martin Carpena.

Sinner then served out for a famous win, ending Djokovic’s cherished unbeaten 21-singles winning streak in the Davis Cup and becoming the first man since 2019 to beat the Serb in singles twice in the same year. The drama between the two rivals wasn’t over, as the two teams inevitably both drafted in their top singles players into the doubles decider. Sinner was again magnificent and still looking ominously fresh after more than four hours on court, with Djokovic’s weak backhand into the net off the Italian’s second serve in the doubles on match point seeming to sum up his disappointment. The beneficiaries of all this? Lleyton Hewitt’s Australian side, who were happily enjoying a day’s rest at their team hotel further down the Costa del Sol, watching the drama unfold on TV.

While the Italy tie didn’t finish until 8.15pm after a noon start, Alex de Minaur and co should be fresh for combat in Sunday afternoon’s (Monday AEDT) final as they seek to lift the Davis Cup for the first time in 20 years. AAP De Minaur, Popyrin power Australia into Davis Cup final Lleyton Hewitt has declared his close-knit tennis band of brothers will give it “a hell of a shake” to bring back the Davis Cup to Australia after they roared into another final in Malaga. Following their 2-0 victory over Finland in Friday’s semi-final, executed superbly without a dropped set in singles wins for Alexei Popyrin and Alex de Minaur, team captain Hewitt said he couldn’t be prouder of their achievement in making back-to-back finals.

And even though they’ll be facing either a Serbian side led by world No.1 Novak Djokovic or an Italian team inspired by young superstar Jannik Sinner in Sunday’s (Monday AEDT) final, the inspirational de Minaur was adamant: “No one really wants to play us.” He delivered once more for Australia, taking an 11th victory in his last 13 cup singles matches, sealing Friday’s (Saturday AEDT) win by defeating Emil Ruusuvuori 6-4, 6-3. Alex de Minaur stretches to return the ball against Finland’s Emil Ruusuvuori. Credit: AP It had followed a superb win from teammate Popyrin, who defied jangling nerves to earn a 7-6 (7-5), 6-2 victory over Otto Virtanen. It meant the Australians’ crack doubles team of Max Purcell and Matt Ebden weren’t even needed.

It will be Australia’s 49th appearance in the Davis Cup final, as they seek the trophy for the 29th t28-time champions Australia, in a 49th final, seek a first win in the World Cup of men’s tennis in 20 years. “We’re a very solid squad, a lot of depth in every single position, and if we can get ourselves to a deciding doubles, we’ve got an unbelievable pairing as well,” de Minaur said. “So we singles guys have just got do our best to try and get a win and let the doubles guys do the job. “Hopefully we can go one better this year,” he added, recalling the 2-0 defeat by Canada in 2022. De Minaur had been the hero on Wednesday, pulling out an extraordinary comeback win over Jiri Lehecka with Australia on the verge of defeat in their quarter-final with the Czech Republic.

But he was happy to pass the laurels to Popyrin, a late squad replacement who’d been asked to take on the troublesome “second singles” role by Hewitt. Loading “Alexei hasn’t played for Australia in a very long time [two years], had a massive match today against a very high-quality opponent and dug super deep,” said de Minaur. Popyrin managed to deliver a rock solid game, making only 11 unforced errors to his erratic opponent’s 25, to prevail in just under an hour-and-a-half. “It was probably the biggest win of my career,” he admitted. “To win a match that means so much to us, it’s an honour and something I’ll never forget. Nothing compares to this.

“I thought I was ready but when I came out and heard the two sets of fans chanting so hard, but it was nerves that I’ve never experienced before.” Loading It wasn’t easy. The pressure was on with Thanasi Kokkinakis, the injured teammate he’d replaced, Purcell and Jordan Thompson having all lost opening singles ties in this year’s competition, and Popyrin struggled too against a big-hitting 22-year-old going for broke. But after repelling a set point in the opening stanza, Popyrin’s solidity in comparison to his increasingly erratic opponent helped silence a noisy contingent of Finnish fans, who’d been hoping to cheer their underdogs to a first-ever final. De Minaur, cheered on by his excited mum, then didn’t need similar heroics to Wednesday’s as he overcame the loss of the first two games.","‘Biggest win of my career’: De Minaur, Popyrin power Australia into Davis Cup final",https://www.theage.com.au/sport/tennis/biggest-win-of-my-career-de-minaur-popyrin-power-australia-into-davis-cup-final-20231125-p5emr5.html?ref=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_source=rss_sport,The Age
sports,Jacob Camenker,2023-11-06T21:17:51+00:00,"The Panthers entered the 2023 NFL season shrouded in optimism. The team had moved on from Matt Rhule, who proved to be an ineffective NFL coach, and added a potential franchise quarterback to the fold in Bryce Young.

The hope was that those moves would turn Carolina into a contender in the wide-open NFC South.

Instead, they find themselves not only at the bottom of the division but also sporting one of the worst records in the NFL at 1-7.

Young hasn't yet looked comfortable in the Panthers' offense, and he is coming off one of his worst games as a starter against the Colts. He threw three interceptions in that contest, including two pick-sixes to Kenny Moore in a 27-13 defeat.

MORE: Full list of rookie quarterbacks to start an NFL game in 2023

The rest of the Panthers' offense hasn't been much better. Adam Thielen has looked rejuvenated in his new home, but running back Miles Sanders has been a bust acquisition. And the team's offensive line has allowed 74 pressures on the season, good for the 10th-most in the NFL.

Indeed, Carolina's offense has been less-than-impressive in 2023. That's the main reason that coach Frank Reich finds himself under fire for the team's performance.

Reich already gave up play-calling to offensive coordinator Thomas Brown after the team's early-season struggles. Now, there are questions about whether the team's lackluster offense — which averages the fifth-fewest yards (283.4) and sixth-fewest points (17.5) per game this season — could ultimately cause owner David Tepper to move on from Reich after just one season.

Will the Panthers fire Frank Reich?

The Panthers aren't guaranteed to fire Reich even amid their poor season. But as ESPN's Adam Schefter implied on ""The Pat McAfee Show,"" the retread coach's seat is growing hotter with each passing week.

""I don't think anybody's got a long rope there just because of the type of season that they're having,"" Schefter said when asked about Reich's status in Carolina.

Schefter stopped short of saying that Reich was on the hot seat. However, he detailed that owner David Tepper wouldn't be afraid to move on from Reich if he deemed it necessary for the success of his team.

""One thing about David Tepper: he's not very patient,"" Schefter said. ""He's as successful as he is because of the way he's operated his business. And it's worked for him, basically at every level. He does what he wants. And I don't think that people are thinking that there's trouble right now with those people. But would anybody be surprised with anything that happens in Carolina this year? No.""

""One thing about David Tepper is he's not very patient and he does whatever he wants..



I don't think anybody would be surprised if anything happens in Carolina with the season that they're having"" ~ @AdamSchefter #PMSLive pic.twitter.com/PV7bfVUtHp — Pat McAfee (@PatMcAfeeShow) November 6, 2023

Schefter pointed to Carolina's firing of Rhule as an example of Tepper's impatience. There had been rumors that the owner was going to wait things out with Rhule in the weeks leading up to his in-season departure. Instead, he decided to pull the trigger and part with him.

While Reich isn't guaranteed to meet the same fate, it's becoming clearer that he will need to deliver some wins to help earn a second season in charge of the Panthers.

And as Schefter notes, the team's ""Thursday Night Football"" game against the Bears may be among the most important games remaining on Carolina's schedule, as the team grapples with justifying the trade-up to select Young.

Let's keep in mind, [the Panthers] play the Bears Thursday night. The Bears have their No. 1 draft pick. So if the Bears win on Thursday, that's a huge victory and in a bigger way than just the game itself.

Again, that's not to say that Reich will be fired after Thursday's game. After all, he might not be fired at all if he can help Carolina to earn some wins during the second half of the season.

But if Tepper loses his patience with Reich, he could go back to the drawing board and bring another new head coach aboard.

Frank Reich coaching record

Reich has posted a winning record of 41-40-1 in his 81 career regular-season games as a head coach. This is despite the fact that the Panthers have posted a record of just 1-7 under his watch this season.

The reason for this is that Reich had a solid four-plus-year stint with the Colts. He had three winning seasons during his five campaigns in Indianapolis and totaled a record of 40-33-1 with the team despite dealing with numerous changes at the quarterback position.

Below is a year-by-year breakdown of Reich's record with the Colts and Panthers.

Year Team Record 2018 Colts 10-6 2019 Colts 7-9 2020 Colts 11-5 2021 Colts 9-8 2022 Colts* 3-5-1 2023 Panthers 1-7 Total Colts/Panthers 41-40-1

* Fired after Week 9 of the season.

Reich made it to the postseason in two of his first three seasons with the Colts. The team posted a record of 1-2 in three contests across those two appearances.

It's also worth noting that Reich has had a different Week 1 starter at quarterback in each of his first six seasons as a head coach. He was hoping to break that streak with Young in Carolina, but he will need to first make it to a seventh season with the club.",Will the Panthers fire Frank Reich?

sports,"Aidan Wohl, GoAZCATS.com",2023-11-18T23:45:32+00:00,"Saturday’s game between Arizona and Utah was many things for the Wildcats: Senior Day, Military Appreciation Day, and their last home game of the season. With the UA needing a win to keep its own destiny alive for a Pac-12 Championship appearance, it handled the pressure once again against a ranked team.

The Wildcats not only got halfway through en route to winning out but did it in statement fashion Saturday at Arizona Stadium in front of a sold out stadium, blowing out No. 22 Utah, 42-18, extending their winning streak to five games, as well as marking their first win over the Utes since 2015. It is also the first time the UA took down four ranked teams in a season since 1989, with it being the only team in the country this season to do so.

""Great win for the program,"" Arizona head coach Jedd Fisch said following the win. ""Great win for our team, great win for our seniors, great win for Tucson, appreciate Tucson coming out in full force, selling out the stadium. ... I think you might as well put the season tickets on sale for next year on Monday and see if we can get six sell outs.""

Leading the Wildcats was junior safety Dalton Johnson, logging 11 tackles as well as two tackles for loss in the UA’s routing.

""Dalton is a fantastic tackler,"" Fisch said. ""When he's around the ball, he gets them down.""

After failing continuously on trick plays involving receiver Tetairoa McMillan passing behind the scrimmage this season, Arizona head coach Jedd Fisch designed it again — this time to perfection — with McMillan finding a wide-open fifth-year senior Michael Wiley to score a touchdown in his last game in Tucson.

Following the trickery, another huge roar of the Wildcat faithful ensued following a blocked punt and score by Anthony Ward, the first Arizona blocked punt and score since Nov. 13, 2021.

The Wildcats’ momentum was rolling like a well-oiled machine on both ends of the ball in the first half, scoring offensive touchdowns on three of four drives, led by Michael Wiley tallying two of them, and outgaining the Utes by 98 yards on the ground, as well as forcing the Utes to two three-and-outs, three punts and a red zone interception, headlined by captain linebacker Jacob Manu, the first Arizona linebacker interception since Anthony Pandy against USC in 2021. With rain starting to pour late in the first half in a rare Arizona “rain game”, the overcast didn’t hinder the Zona Zoo from leaving the stadium, nor the Wildcats from letting up their progression, resulting in the UA taking staggering 28-7 lead at halftime.

""I don't think the rain effected us at all,"" Fisch said.

With the rain starting to clear up to start the second half, overtime it was clear that the Wildcats’ defense was holding a cloud over the Utes’ heads. Arizona got off to a slow start but picked up much of its thunderous momentum after junior safety Gunner Maldonado broke up a pass on fourth and three. Since the fourth-down stop, the UA logged an interception and another turnover on downs.

Although the defense was surging, the Wildcats not scoring since the first drive of the second quarter — their offense seemed to have lost its touch.

But then “Swag Surfin” by Fast Life Yungstaz came on, signaling the fourth quarter, the quarter in which going into the game, Arizona was outscoring opponents 90-37. The Wildcats on their first drive put a touchdown on the board a seven play, 61 yard drive, thanks to a 25-yard dash before diving into the end zone by running back Jonah Coleman. The UA then ran away from the Utes, outscoring them 14-8, only allowing a garbage time touchdown in the last minute to secure its 8th win of the season.

The last touchdown for Arizona came with backup quarterback Jayden de Laura hitting McMillan for a 51-yard touchdown.

""I wanted Jayden to go out with a touchdown pass this season,"" Fisch said. ""I think that he deserves that.""

When asked about whether the win against Utah, who has beat the Wildcats the last six meetings, signified anything further about the program, Fisch said that the win signified that they are having a great year.

""[It signifies] that we're not gonna back down from anybody, and we feel really good about trying to continue to improve, get more physical, get tougher,"" Fisch said.

For fifth-year senior captain Jordan Morgan, who missed his opportunity last season to play in Senior Day last season due to injury, the Tucson native noted that being able to compete and win in his final game at Arizona Stadium ""means so much.""

""I finally got to finish off with a bang like this at home for the last time in my career, so really enjoyed it,"" Morgan said.

Arizona (8-3, 6-2 Pac-12) will take on its in-state rival Arizona State (3-7, 2-5) next Saturday for the 97th annual Territorial Cup.

""I think our team will be very excited for the game against ASU,"" Fisch said. ""There won't be a question about that. We understand the importance of the game, we want to keep the Territorial Cup here in Tucson and our guys recognize that, understand that and we will put all of our focus starting tomorrow at 9 a.m.","No. 17 Arizona dominates No. 22 Utah, 42-18",https://arizona.rivals.com/news/recap-no-17-arizona-dominates-no-22-utah-42-18-on-senior-day,Rivals
sports,Sid Lowe at the Ramón Sánchez Pizjuán Stadium,2023-10-24T21:06:55+00:00,"In the end they were made to resist, but Arsenal are back on top. On a night when Mikel Arteta said his side were forced to play many games in one, controlling when it was called for, holding on when they had to and slipping in the knife when the opportunity arose, the very last kick and the chance to have the last word fell to the Sevilla striker Lucas Ocampos.

With the clock on 97 minutes, the hosts 2-1 down and the ball sitting up, he could have changed everything. Instead he sliced past David Raya’s left hand and into the stand, leaving his team facing the prospect of another Europa League adventure and their opponents’ future in the continent’s premier competition in their own hands.

As Ocampos sat on the turf, the Sánchez-Pizjuán fell quiet, except for the 3,000 Arsenal fans high in the corner who had watched what their coach described as another step in this team’s development, “a brutal experience”. This, he said, was a victory of merit; it was a demonstration too of the emotional management he had demanded, with Declan Rice and William Saliba among those who impressed. Though none shone brighter than Gabriel Jesus.

Ultimately, two grand moments from the Brazilian either side of half‑time did it: the first an exceptional assist that broke the game open in the blink of an eye, the second the shot that flashed past Ørjan Nyland and into the far corner. Asked afterwards which was better, Arteta replied “both”, adding: “I would like to see a replay of the first in slow motion because it was so sharp. He came for a reason: this is our level now and we need players like that.”

Arsenal’s opener came at the very end of the first half, when the game had begun to tilt slightly away from them and an initially timid Sevilla had started to think they could get a goal of their own. Instead, they found themselves sliced open. Superb footwork from Ocampos enabled him to get away from Bukayo Saka, nicking the ball through the England player’s legs and running at the defence, space opening before him but Dodi Lukebakio’s cross was cleared and Sevilla were suddenly exposed, stripped bare by Jesus.

A lovely turn enabled him to evade two players and slide the ball into a huge gap. Dashing free was Gabriel Martinelli, alone from the halfway line. A long run to the goal, right through the middle, and Nyland came to him. It was the second time the two men had come face to face, the Norwegian denying Martinelli when he had been released by Jorginho after 10 minutes, but this time the outcome was different. Martinelli slowed, stepped around the keeper to the right and rolled the ball into an empty net.

When that first opportunity had been passed up, it didn’t seem to matter much: at that point it had appeared Arsenal would open Sevilla again and often. They had stepped high and dominated the opening period. And yet Diego Alonso’s side would settle, even if too often their moves ended at the feet of Lukebakio. It was he who missed their best early opportunity, failing to control by the penalty spot after the kind of loose Raya pass that can only fuel the goalkeeping debate had gifted Sevilla possession in a dangerous position.

The next chance came Sevilla’s way too, Sergio Ramos stepping out from the back to find Ocampos who nudged it into the path of Youssef En‑Nesyri. Beyond the defence, his shot faded past the far post.

If Sevilla were encouraged forward by that, it proved to be their downfall right on the verge of half-time, and soon after the break they had conceded again. Jesus received on the left, cut inside Jesús Navas, stepped on to the sweet spot for a shot and bent a brilliant finish into the far corner.

Arsenal had started the second period as if determined to end this and now, nine minutes in, it seemed that they might have done but it did not play out that way. A Nemanja Gudelj header from a corner put Sevilla back in it and then Mariano Díaz, on as a substitute, brought the ball down on his chest and smashed a shot against the bar. Next came a overhead kick from Ocampos, going close; game on.

Sevilla were throwing what they could at Arsenal now. These were the moments Arteta had meant, stressing the importance of knowing that they will always come and having the capacity to withstand them. “These games demand you play lots of different games,” he said. “We controlled it and created chances but at 2-0 we did not kill them off. We conceded from a corner and then we lacked control and had to defend our area, but we are very happy because we found those different things that are very important, and in a stadium where not many teams have won.”

If he had warned his side, so had the fans in this arena, a huge banner unfurled at the start declaring: “Europe knows what we are capable of”. They were going to fight, that was for sure. On 90 minutes, En-Nesyri leapt to head. Raya then had to push away a wayward cross that almost sneaked in and Nyland was sent up for a corner until, in the very last second, the ball sat up before Ocampos.

sports,James Gregory,2023-11-06T22:18:35+00:00,"Nine-men Tottenham suffered their first loss of the Premier League campaign in a fiery 2-1 defeat at home to Chelsea.

Jackson rifled in a 75th minute winner from Raheem Sterling’s square-ball pass as the Blues came from behind to win at manager – Mauricio Pochettino’s former home ground – with the Argentinean having managed Spurs between 2014-19.

The Senegal forward then struck twice in injury time to claim his first hat-trick as a Chelsea player and wrap up a clinical victory.

Dejan Kulusevski had earlier put Tottenham ahead in the sixth minute but Cole Palmer equalised from a 35th minute penalty, after Cristian Romero had been red carded for a foul on Enzo Fernandez.

The hosts’ disastrous evening worsened with injuries to Mickey van de Ven and James Maddison, whilst Destiny Udogie was sent off in the 55th minute for a second bookable offence.

Speaking to BBC post-match, Tottenham manager, Ange Postecoglou said: “There was a fair bit going on, a lot of VAR intervention, a hard game for me to analyse but I am very proud of the players. Right to the end they were trying to create something for us.

“The players couldn’t give any more than they did, part of this game is will, effort and determination and they showed that.”

Tottenham now sit second in the table, whilst Chelsea’s win lifted them up to tenth on goal difference from fellow London rivals, Crystal Palace.

Having slipped to second in the table over the weekend, Tottenham started with high energy and fluidity which saw Pape Matar Sarr play Son Heung-min through in the fifth minute, but the South Korea international saw his shot saved by Robert Sanchez.

That chance proved to be an early warning which Chelsea failed to heed as Sarr flicked on a sixth-minute diagonal pass for Kulusevski, who calmly rifled into the near-right corner to put Tottenham back top of the table at that point.

Pedro Porro almost doubled Spurs’ lead a minute later as he rifled upon goal from Kulusevski’s pullback pass of Brennan Johnson’s cross, yet Sanchez was able to make a comfortable save.

Chelsea’s first chance eventually came in the 11th minute as Jackson forced a save from Guglielmo Vicario, before Son briefly extended the hosts lead two minutes later with a tap-in but he was ruled offside via his right shoulder position.

Tottenham soon afterwards began to lose their composure and Romero was lucky not to be sent off in the 21st minute, after he retaliated with a kick on Levi Colwill following an initial shove on the Argentinean.

Sterling meanwhile scored for Chelsea amidst that incident seconds later but his goal was ruled out for handball, after his first shot rebounded off Porro onto his right arm before he put the ball away beyond Vicario.

Sterling though had found himself the subject of a reckless tackle from Udogie two minutes earlier, with the Italian getting away with a yellow card.

Fernandez and Thiago Silva then saw shots go wide for Chelsea but tensions soon hit boiling point in the 28th minute, as Moises Caicedo had an equalising goal disallowd due to Jackson interfering with play as the Colombian delivered his shot upon goal.

Romero meanwhile clipped Fernandez inside the box with a high-footed challenge which sent his compatriot to ground, and resulted in a red card for the Spus defender following a lengthy VAR review and referee – Michael Oliver awarded Chelsea a penalty.

Palmer eventually stepped up in the 35th minute and Vicario got a touch on the Englishman’s penalty, yet could only deflect it onto the right post, which saw the ball ricochet into the bottom-right corner to pull the West London visitors level.

Chelsea quickly pushed on after their equaliser against an imploding Spurs defence but failed to find a breakthrough goal before half-time, whilst the hosts lost Romero’s central defensive teammate – Mickey van de Ven to injury alongside James Maddison in two huge blows.

Tottenham however were lucky to not be down to nine men at the break after Sarr and Colwill came to blows in the tenth minute of injury time, yet Oliver decided to just yellow card both players than send either player off.

Reece James was then lucky not to be dismissed for Chelsea in the 11th minute of injury-time after he elbowed Udogie in the face, yet VAR deemed it a simple incident and not a yellow or red card offence.

Colwill though found himself hooked off at half-time by Mauricio Pochettino for Marc Cucurella, due to his ill-tempered first-half antics.

Upon the restart, Chelsea quickly made their one-man advantage count but their recurring end product issues reared its head, as Palmer rifled wide in the 47th minute in a fast start from the Blues.

Sterling then broke forward seven minutes later but his shot was blocked by Vicario, before he seconds later broke forward on a counter-attack, which drew a foul from Udogie who was consequently dismissed to put Spurs down to nine men with 35 minutes left on the clock.

If Chelsea thought that decision boosted their prospects of a second goal then poor finishing looked to be their Achilles heel, as Jackson flicked over the bar from James’ cutback pass following a short free-kick.

Jackson continued to push for his third goal of the campaign but his 58th minute shot was punched away by Vicario, when then blocked Palmer’s rebound shot.

Chelsea continued to press and eventually got their reward as Sterling broke forward up the right flank at the start of the 75th minute, and found Jackson unmarked to rifle his pass into the left corner to put the Blues ahead at Pochettino’s former team.

Tottenham however seemingly responded three minutes later as substitute, Rodrigo Bentancur flicked a free-kick behind for Eric Dier to volley into the top-left corner, but he was adjudged offside as Bentancur nodded the ball into his path.

Chelsea eventually clung on for a fourth league win of the season after Bentancur narrowly put a 86th minute header wide, as Spurs valiantly tried to chase an unsuccessful equaliser in which Son saw a 93rd minute shot denied by Sanchez.

Jackson subsequently rounded off Tottenham’s nightmare evening a minute later as he turned Gallagher’s pass into the net to seal a triumphant return to North London for Pochettino and his Blues, before he completed his hat-trick two minutes later.

The 22 year-old first turned in Connor Gallagaher’s 94th minute pass followed by a clinical strike from Palmer’s pass in the 97th minute, which secured Jackson his first Premier League hat-trick of his career.

Postecoglou meanwhile suffered a first home defeat as a manager since he began his 52-match unbeaten home run in November 2020 during his time at Yokohama F. Marinos, then two-year spell at Celtic plus now Tottenham.

He’s played his entire six-year MLB career with the Angels, but his teams haven’t even sniffed the postseason and Ohtani’s made his desire to win crystal clear, so he won’t be back. Will he chase every dollar possible, going solely by the highest offer? That seems unlikely, too. Remember, Ohtani wants to win.

Lots of teams can meet Ohtani in that middle ground, offering both lots of money — he will absolutely sign the largest contract in baseball history — and lots of chances to compete for a World Series title (or two or three). It’s a long list.

So, the baseball world waits for news. We have been promised very little of that, though. ESPN’s Jeff Passan reported this: “If visits between Ohtani and a team are reported publicly, it will be held against the team.”

Shohei Ohtani free agent rumors and updates

Ohtani has an 'affinity' for Boston, it seems

Date: Nov. 27

Source: Jeff Passan, ESPN

Hope everyone enjoyed the Thanksgiving holiday. Us baseball writers are pleased that Ohtani didn't decide to sign while the turkey was still warm. This isn't exactly ""breaking news"" because rumors have been swirling, but it's an aside from an in-the-know reporter that just might give one fan base a little too much hope and excitement.

Passan wrote a piece about 10 teams to watch the rest of the offseason, and he threw this little note in the section about the Red Sox, and how they needed to sign Yoshinobu Yamamoto.

Boston's bats are good, or good enough at least, to avoid having to spend like mad in a down year for free agent hitters -- unless, of course, it's for Ohtani, who has an affinity for Boston. If the Red Sox don't hit that jackpot, they're backfilled nicely with a system that includes outfielder Roman Anthony, shortstop Marcelo Mayer and catcher Kyle Teel, among the best trios of offensive prospects in baseball.

It's cool when the best player in the world is a free agent and has an ""affinity"" for your town.

Maybe Ohtani won’t sign quite so soon after all

Source: Ken Rosenthal, The Athletic

Buried at the bottom of Rosenthal’s piece on what an Ohtani contract might look like — incentives, opt-outs and all sorts of stuff — is this little bit of reporting:

An agreement at the winter meetings in Nashville the first week of December would be the ideal outcome for MLB, but not necessarily for Ohtani. He perhaps will be better off waiting for the signing of Japanese righty Yoshinobu Yamamoto, who is expected to be posted for free agency as soon as Monday, triggering a 45-day window for teams to negotiate with him. Losing out on the 25-year-old Yamamoto, who could command more than $200 million, might put certain teams on tilt, improving the landscape for Ohtani.

Interesting, certainly.

Mariners out of the Ohtani chase?

Date: Nov. 17

Source: Daniel Kramer, MLB.com

Here’s the key piece of the article: “Industry sources told MLB.com this week that landing Ohtani doesn’t appear to be within the Mariners’ realistic agenda this offseason.”

In a way, that’s surprising. The Mariners seem to check a lot of boxes for Ohtani. They’re set up to win for a long time with a bunch of young starting pitchers and a co-superstar in Julio Rodriguez. Plus, Ohtani would get to be part of the quest for the franchise’s first World Series title, he’d get to wear the same uniform as his baseball hero, Ichiro, and he’s lived there in the offseason. So it must be about the money, and Seattle’s reluctance to even get in the conversation. That’s gotta be super disappointing for Mariners fans starved for a title, right?

On the other hand, maybe the M’s know all about Ohtani’s desire to keep the rumor mill quiet, and leaking “news” like this would please Ohtani and his camp.

‘Timing could be right for a Cubs-Ohtani union’

The Cubs were one of the seven finalists for Ohtani the first time around, but lack of the DH in the NL at the time made it hard for Ohtani to choose Chicago. His primary goal was showing he could both hit and pitch at a high level for an MLB team, and trying to play the outfield instead of just DHing would have been too much, even for Ohtani.

Now, though? The NL has the DH, and the Cubs are itching to make a sport-shaking signing. Well, another sport-shaking signing. They already poached Craig Counsell from the rival Brewers to be their new manager, and it would be shocking if they didn’t make a corresponding player-acquisition move. Ohtani’s at the top of the list.

Ohtani could potentially sign before Winter Meetings

Pretty much everyone in baseball would LOVE for this to happen. The team that winds up signing him, of course, will kick the Ohtani hype machine into gear ASAP. Not only is there merchandise to sell, but the front office will use that signing to help lure other potential free agents, maybe even for a “play with Ohtani” discount. But even for the other teams, knowing that Ohtani is off the board relatively soon into the offseason would allow them to shift to other priorities, like trading for Juan Soto or deciding which free-agent pitchers to pursue with the money that might have been earmarked for Ohtani.","Shohei Ohtani rumors tracker: Latest news, updates on free agent's MLB future",https://www.sportingnews.com/us/mlb/news/shohei-ohtani-rumors-tracker-latest-news-updates-free-agent/6593aa54c999febe209052e3,Sporting News

Ryan Blaney’s recent championship victory in his Ford Mustang at the NASCAR Cup Series Championship Race was a moment of pride and celebration for Ford. However, it’s not just about winning the races or championships for the manufacturer. It’s about marketing and maintaining their brand loyalty, as a Ford insider reveals.

Last Sunday, Ryan Blaney secured his first-ever championship by skillfully maneuvering his Ford Mustang to victory at Phoenix. He held off the late challenges from Chevrolet drivers Kyle Larson and William Byron. This achievement marks a significant moment for Ford and its NASCAR program, as it made a clean sweep by winning championships in Truck, Xfinity, and Cup Series.

In the post-race media conference, Mark Rushbrook, the Global Director for Ford Performance, was asked if winning the championship has any significance for the manufacturer as a whole in terms of marketing the brand globally.

Mark Rushbrook emphasized the importance of winning with the Mustang from a global marketing perspective. He stated, “Yeah, winning is everything for us, just as a point of pride. It’s certainly going to be a celebration in Dearborn. My phone has been blowing up with Ford family members and our senior executives already so excited about it. It means a lot internally to the customer because motorsports is so important to us.”

Rushbrook highlighted that success on the racetrack is the foundation of successful marketing programs. Winning races and championships builds credibility with fans and encourages them to engage with the brand. He explained, “That is the basis for successful marketing programs; it is success on the racetrack. So you have to win the races, you have to win championships to have that credibility, and for fans to engage with your brand and make them proud to have a Ford parked in their driveway or in their garage.”

While Ford’s racing program, featuring the Mustang, certainly boosts the sale of this iconic sports car, the Ford insider dropped an interesting fact. Rushbrook revealed, “For us, NASCAR, even though we’re racing a Mustang, we certainly sell Mustangs because of it. But we sell more F-150s to NASCAR fans. This is a proof point for them.”

The Ford F-150 truck, known for its ruggedness and reliability, has garnered a dedicated following among NASCAR enthusiasts. Winning the championship is not only about showcasing the Mustang but also the Ford-150, with which Ben Rhodes won his second Truck Series championship on Friday. This is also a testament to the power of NASCAR in influencing car-buying decisions.

Ford’s global marketing strategy also leverages the success of the Mustang in NASCAR, utilizing it as a marketing tool to promote their road cars worldwide. As the seventh generation Mustang continues to be sold globally as a road car, it’s racing not only in NASCAR but also in various international series, including Australia Supercars, Mustang GT3, Mustang GT4, and Dark Horse R with a Spec Challenge.

In essence, Ford takes the benefits from any Mustang’s racing success and uses it to market their cars globally. It’s a win-win situation for both the brand and racing enthusiasts. Although, all this might not have come to pass were it not for a timely intervention by “The Captain.”

Roger Penske played a big part in calming Ryan Blaney down in the clutch moment of the race

In the heat of the championship race at Phoenix, Ryan Blaney’s competitive spirit almost got the best of him. He was racing for the championship and was eager to secure the lead from Ross Chastain in the closing few laps. However, he was also aware that he needed to maintain his position to win the title.

In the post-race conference, the Team Penske driver expressed his frustration, stating, “There is no secret that I can snap on the radio. That’s been my whole life. That’s been my whole career. It’s just kind of something I do.” He described the intense battle with Ross Chastain, who blocked him multiple times, making it a tough fight.

The final push came when Blaney made contact with Chastain. A move made out of frustration, as he admitted. But at this crucial moment, team owner Roger Penske, often referred to as “The Captain,” stepped in. He reminded Blaney that he was not racing against Chastain but against the HMS duo. Penske’s calming influence helped Blaney regain composure, ensuring that he didn’t take any unnecessary risks. The result? A championship for Ryan Blaney and another testament to the guidance of “The Captain” in high-pressure situations.

sports,Bryan Murphy,2023-10-10T22:30:03+00:00,"First game, first point, first win.

Connor Bedard's debut did not disappoint on Tuesday, as the Chicago rookie helped the Blackhawks to a 4-2 win over the Penguins on opening night.

The Blackhawks rallied from a 2-0 deficit, scoring four unanswered goals to pick up the victory in Pittsburgh.

Bryan Rust opened the scoring for the Penguins in the first period, and a Sidney Crosby goal in the second doubled the Pittsburgh lead. However, Bedard helped set up a Ryan Donato goal in the middle frame to get the Blackhawks on the board, picking up his first NHL point in the process.

In the third period, Cole Guttman potted the equalizer for Chicago early in the frame. With less than five minutes left in regulation, Jason Dickinson fired home a shot from the slot that gave Chicago its first lead of the night. A Nick Foligno empty net goal sealed the deal for the Blackhawks.

Bedard was as advertised in his NHL debut. The Chicago rookie led all players on his club in shots on goal, recording five in his first game on 11 shot attempts. His 21:29 time on ice was second to only Seth Jones, as Chicago head coach Luke Richardson did not hold the 18-year-old back. He did struggle in the faceoff dot, winning just two of 13 draws, but it was a strong first impression at the NHL level.

For the Penguins, the third period struggles from last season have seemingly carried over to start this year. Last year, Pittsburgh finished tied for the most losses after taking a lead into the third period. The crew followed that trend on Tuesday night, letting a 2-1 lead to start the final frame slip away.

Bedard and the Blackhawks are back in action on national TV tomorrow, as Chicago heads to Boston for a Wednesday night date with the Bruins.

10:20 p.m. — Pittsburgh kills off the Nieto penalty, but seconds after going back to even strength, Letang picks up a cross-checking minor. Chicago goes right back to the man advantage.

10:19 p.m. — Corey Perry had not just one, but two point-blank chances in front of the Pittsburgh net, but he put the puck right into the midsection of Jarry both times.

9:46 p.m. — Chicago kills off the delay of game penalty, so it's back to even strength. For all the star power on the top unit, the Pittsburgh power play has not been as crisp as expected.

Penguins 2, Blackhawks 0

9:42 p.m. — GOAL! Crosby's goal stands, as the official determine the play was onside. A great cycle from Pittsburgh results in the captain putting home his first of the year with 8:04 to go. With the unsuccessful challenge, the Blackhawks are hit with a delay of game penalty, so the Penguins get the goal and a power play.

9:39 p.m. — The Penguins may have doubled their lead, as Crosby sends a loose puck into the wide open net for the score off a give-and-go with Guentzel. However, the Blackhawks are challenging the play for offside. Marcus Pettersson had to reach for the puck along the blue line and it may have come out of the zone.

9:27 p.m. — Jarry keeps the shutout going with two real strong saves on Johnson. A shot from the point was tipped by an unmanned Johnson at the top of the crease. When that didn't go, he got a second whack at the loose puck, but Jarry stuck out the leg to make the stop.

9:23 p.m. — Reilly Smith, who was traded to the Penguins this offseason from the Golden Knights, is denied by the glove of Mrazek off the rush. Smith had a puck trickle to him on the right side, but he shot it right into the mitt of the Blackhawks goaltender.

9:21 p.m. — Pittsburgh kills off the Carter minor. Chicago made it fairly easy on that power play, putting just one shot on net and spending a majority of the man advantage passing around the perimeter.

9:19 p.m. — Jeff Carter gives the Blackhawks an early power play, as the Penguins veteran is called for holding the stick of Korchinski. Chicago gets its second crack on the man advantage.

9:15 p.m. — Puck is down for the second period in Pittsburgh.

End of the first period: Penguins 1, Blackhawks 0

8:56 p.m. — The first 20 minutes features tons of shot attempts, but Rust's tally is the only one on the scoreboard. A strong showing so far from Bedard, who has not shied away from putting the puck on net. He had four shot attempts in the opening frame, with two on net. The Blackhawks out-shot the Penguins 17-13, but Pittsburgh holds the lead.

8:51 p.m. — An excellent shift by Bedard nearly results in his first goal. Initially, Bedard shows off his elite release by zipping a shot from long-range, but it's turned aside by Jarry. Later in the shift, the rookie gets two whacks at a loose puck in front of the crease, but he could not beat the Penguins goaltender.

8:47 p.m. — Noel Acciari and Tyler Johnson collide in the neutral zone, and Johnson is left leaking from the bridge of his nose. Initially Acciari is assessed a double minor for high-sticking, but after reviewing the play, no penalty was killed. The officials deemed that the stick was not above the shoulders, therefore, no infraction.

8:46 p.m. — The Blackhawks kill off the Kaiser minor. Pittsburgh managed to get three shots on Mrazek, but could not build on its lead.

8:43 p.m. — Karlsson dances by Cole Guttman at the blue line, walks into the slot and lets one rip, but Mrazek stares it down the whole way, making the glove stop on the Penguins defenseman.

Erik Karlsson with the moves 👀#LetsGoPens | #NHLFaceoff pic.twitter.com/GCWVIGnAS2 — Hockey Daily 365 l NHL Highlights & News (@HockeyDaily365) October 11, 2023

8:41 p.m. — Pittsburgh heads to its first power play of the game, as Wyatt Kaiser trips up Malkin in the neutral zone. This will be the first time seeing Erik Karlsson running the power play for the Penguins, taking Letang's place on the top unit with Crosby, Malkin, Guentzel and Rickard Rakell.

8:36 p.m. — Evgeni Malkin makes a beautiful saucer pass to Jake Guentzel cutting the net, but the Penguins winger could not elevate the puck over the shoulder of Mrazek. At the other end, Taylor Raddysh took a feed from behind the net, but put it right in the midsection of Jarry.

8:34 p.m. — Rust opening the scoring for the Penguins to start the year has become a trend. The winger has potted the first goal in the team's opener in each of the last three seasons.

8:30 p.m. — Moments after the Rust tally, Crosby nearly doubles the Penguins' lead on a breakaway, but his backhand attempt was stuffed by Mrazek's pad.

Penguins 1, Blackhawks 0

8:29 p.m. — GOAL! Right after the Penguins killed off the Eller minor, Pittsburgh gets on the board first courtesy of Bryan Rust. Kris Letang throws a shot on net that Rust tips up and over the shoulder of the Blackhawks goaltender. It was not originally called a goal on the ice, but after review, it's 1-0 Penguins with 12:56 remaining in the frame.

8:28 p.m. — It's a strong showing from the top PP unit for the Blackhawks, but Bedard and Co. can't capitalize on the man advantage. Chicago had four shots on goal, including a Bedard one-timer that was stopped by the pad of Mrazek.

8:26 p.m. — Penguins forward Lars Eller is called for goalie interference, as he clips the leg of Petr Mrazek in the crease. The Blackhawks head to the first power play of the game about five minutes into the period.

8:23 p.m. — Through the first four minutes, it's been a back-and-forth affair. Neither team have been able to sustain much pressure. Most of Chicago's shot attempts have been from the outside, making it easy on Tristan Jarry.

8:19 p.m. — It was an uneventful first shift for Bedard, as the Penguins controlled most of the play in the Blackhawks' zone.

8:17 p.m. — Bedard and Crosby square up for the opening face off, and Bedard's debut is underway!

sports,Emily Dozier,2023-11-11T22:23:02+00:00,"The SEC East champs put on a show, to say the least. Georgia dominated against ninth-ranked Ole Miss, coming up with a 52-17 win to earn a date with Alabama in the SEC Championship Game in December. All-American tight end Brock Bowers returned to the field for his final homestead only 26 days after TightRope surgery. Starting against the Rebels, he had three catches for 34 yards, adding a touchdown in the fourth quarter. He missed just two games after suffering the high ankle sprain against Vanderbilt on Oct. 14. Georgia didn't need him, though, as the running backs had themselves a night for both teams. Kendall Milton and Daijun Edwards scored two touchdowns each as the Bulldogs finished with 300 rushing yards. Milton ended the night with a career-high 127 yards. For Ole Miss, Quinshon Judkins scored the only two touchdowns and finished with 75 yards. Unfortunately for Rebels, injury continues to plague them after Micah Pettus, the team's top lineman, was ruled out with a broken foot bone he sustained during practice. Quarterback Jaxson Dart left the game at the end of the third quarter after a hit from two Georgia defenders. He held his collarbone as he entered the injury tent. He was taken back to the locker room for further examination and did not return to the game, leaving it in the hands of Spencer Sanders. Before his exit, Dart passed for 112 yards and one interception. Sanders finished it up with 61 yards on four completions. For the Dawgs, Carson Beck finished with 306 yards, two touchdowns and one interception. It's the fourth game this season with over 300 yards and at least two touchdowns. In its trip to the SEC Championship for the third-straight year, Georgia will face Alabama, who it lost to in 2021. A dominant win over the Rebels surely inspires some confidence with two regular season games left. We'll see if the victory was enough to overtake Ohio State as the top team in College Football Playoff rankings.

5:15 p.m. – The weather in Athens is anything but ideal for a top-10 matchup. It'll be in the 40s with a chance of rainfall throughout the evening. But is that better for the Dawgs? Last time ESPN's College Gameday was in town for a crucial SEC matchup, Georgia beat Tennessee on a rainy afternoon. Kirby Smart and his crew seem to only get better in rough weather.

sports,Steven Taranto,2023-12-07T20:15:30+00:00,"Every year, the wintertime and the NASCAR offseason is a welcome -- but very short -- respite from what is otherwise a demanding, year-long grind of racing. Come 2024, that grind is soon to begin again, and exactly what it looks like will be based in large part on these months where driver lineups, crew lineups and rules packages are set.

With much activity going on within the confines of race shops across NASCAR, here are some major storylines for the week of Dec. 4 as the offseason continues.

Offseason testing in Phoenix

One month after Ryan Blaney was crowned the Cup Series champion and the 2023 season was completed out west, Blaney and a select group of other drivers and teams returned to Phoenix Raceway for a two-day test as NASCAR looked at a number of aerodynamic and technical changes for the Next Gen car. Blaney was one of six drivers to participate in the test, joining Chris Buescher, Erik Jones, Christopher Bell, Kyle Larson and Corey LaJoie.

The first day of testing centered around different splitters and diffusers as well as tires engineered to degrade more during green flag runs as NASCAR tries to build upon marginal improvements made to the Next Gen car's short track package in 2023. According to Cole Cusumano, teams ran a simplified diffuser -- featuring just two fins in the middle at a 90-degree angle -- as well as an alternate splitter design.

After ascertaining a direction on aerodynamics and tires, NASCAR spent the second day of the test experimenting with existing mufflers to slightly soften the otherwise deafening noise made by Cup Series motors. Gearbox and shifting changes were not included as part of this test.

Speaking to reporters, Blaney noted the biggest difference came in the alternate splitter, which significantly reduced downforce.

""It was big. The first laps I had I was like, 'Man, this thing drives way different,'"" Blaney said. ""... It's a massive aero loss when you do that. And then the simple diffuser wasn't as big of a change as the splitter, but it was still something to feel.""

The topic of mufflers -- while anathema to the purest of gearheads -- has been one that has occasionally popped up in the Next Gen era, particularly with NASCAR now using mufflers in urban settings at stadiums (Los Angeles Coliseum) and on street courses (Chicago) where noise ordinances are more of a consideration. Kyle Larson told reporters he did not notice a difference in cockpit cooling with the mufflers tested on Wednesday, but spoke positively of the idea overall.

""I definitely think our racecars are way too loud, and probably are still too loud with the mufflers,"" Larson said. ""I think the cars can be quieter just to help the fan experience.""

Notable crew changes

Not one, but two of the biggest stars in NASCAR will have new eyes in the sky in 2024, as the spotters for both Chase Elliott and Ryan Blaney announced they will be stepping down. Eddie D'Hondt announced Saturday he would not return as Elliott's spotter next season, followed Monday by Josh Williams announcing he would step down as Blaney's spotter.

According to Bob Pockrass of Fox Sports, former NASCAR Xfinity Series driver Tim Fedewa, the longtime spotter for Kevin Harvick, will take over as the spotter for Blaney next season. A possible landing spot for Williams exists at Spire Motorsports, as Williams has previously spotted for Zane Smith in the Craftsman Truck Series.

Spire Motorsports announced a number of personnel moves this week, hiring Stephen Doran as the crew chief for Smith's No. 71 Chevrolet and Luke Lambert as the crew chief of the No. 77 for Carson Hocevar. Doran joins Spire from Stewart-Haas Racing, where he was an engineer on the No. 4 team, while Lambert moves to Spire after being crew chief of the No. 42 at Legacy Motor Club in 2023.

In addition, Spire has also hired Doug Duchardt, whose career in racing has included stints at General Motors and Chip Ganassi Racing, as its new team president.

Drivers on the move



Unbeknownst to most at last Sunday's Washington Commanders game, many in NASCAR became aware of a part of Joe Gibbs Racing's 2024 plans in the Xfinity Series and the apparent hiring of a Cup veteran. While serving as a guest of the team, Joe Gibbs was seen introducing Aric Almirola to Commanders owner Josh Harris, with lip readers online ascertaining that Gibbs appeared to tell Harris that Almirola is now driving for them.

According to Bob Pockrass, the expectation is that Almirola will drive part-time for Joe Gibbs Racing -- where he began his NASCAR career in the 2000s -- in the Xfinity Series, joining a driver lineup that will also include Chandler Smith and Sheldon Creed. Such would align with the expectations for Almirola's racing future, as he had entertained continuing to race part-time when it was announced he would not return to Stewart-Haas Racing in 2024.

The matter of Almirola's replacement in the SHR No. 10 has been a rather poorly-kept secret: It is widely expected the team will hire Noah Gragson as its new driver as Gragson looks to reclaim his standing as a bright young star following a disastrous rookie year in Cup with Legacy Motor Club. Gragson was recently spotted at Stewart-Haas Racing's shop, and he also drove a Ford in this past weekend's Snowball Derby with Rette Jones Racing.

Gragson did not let on to any 2024 plans in a recent conversation with Matt Weaver of Sportsnaut, instead choosing to discuss his regrets and personal growth from the end of his rookie season. Gragson resigned as the driver of the No. 42 in August while serving a month-long suspension after he was spotted having liked a racially insensitive meme on his Instagram account.

""There have been some challenges this year, but I wouldn't trade them for anything in the world,"" Gragson said. ""I don't know that I would change anything that has happened because I have learned from it and it gives me a chance to be a better person.

""In life, you either win or you learn, on and off the racetrack. The wins have been great, but you learn through the hardships and defeats. I am grateful to have good people around me, and I'm working really hard every day to hopefully get a second chance and to make the most of it.""

While the Stewart-Haas No. 10 seat is seemingly filled, some intrigue still exists as to exactly who will drive the No. 16 for Kaulig Racing next season. After running the car full-time in 2023, it was announced Thursday that A.J. Allmendinger would go back to full-time Xfinity Series racing for Kaulig in 2024, though he will continue to run a partial Cup schedule.

The assumption of many had been that the No. 16 would be taken over by Ty Dillon, but that assumption may have been premature. Weaver shared in a recent thread on X that information suggesting Dillon had been hired to drive the No. 16 was ""incorrect,"" casting ambiguity on both who will join Daniel Hemric at Kaulig next season as well as the exact plans of Dillon, who has bounced from team to team since Germain Racing shut down following the 2020 season.

sports,Dan Treacy,2023-11-09T23:04:33+00:00,"The Bears and Panthers entered Thursday night looking for progress, not playoff contention. If any team achieved that goal, it was Chicago.

It wasn't an aesthetically pleasing game, but that was never the expectation. The Bears grinded out a 16-13 victory behind a terrific defensive performance, a solid running game, and a few timely throws by Tyson Bagent.

The Panthers jumped out to an early lead on a punt returned for a touchdown by Ihmir Smith-Marsette, but they never found the end zone again. The only offensive touchdown of the night came in the third quarter, when D'Onta Foreman rumbled his way into the end zone to give Chicago a 16-10 lead.

NFL WEEK 10 PICKS: Straight up | Against the spread

As it turned out, 16 points was all the Bears needed. After Eddy Pineiro cut Carolina's deficit to three early in the fourth quarter, Frank Reich put his trust in Pineiro again with the game on the line, sending him out for a 59-yard attempt on fourth-and-10 in the final minutes rather than trusting the offense to pick up the 10 yards. Pineiro's kick was short.

While the decision to kick from 59 yards out might be second-guessed, Carolina's offense didn't give Reich much reason to believe. Bryce Young struggled to develop any kind of rhythm through the first three quarters, and even the Panthers' most successful drives were laborious, consistently requiring conversions on third and fourth down.

While Young got little help from his receivers, who failed to get open all night, his struggles — including multiple passes that were nearly intercepted — are a reminder that the Panthers' offense is still a long way from resembling anything like the unit owner David Tepper envisioned when the franchise traded for the No. 1 pick in March.

MORE: Why Frank Reich's job might already be at risk

The Bears (3-7) are hoping to get Justin Fields back in time for their Week 11 game in Detroit, but they've gotten a shot in the arm from Bagent, who improved to 2-2 as a starter with the win. The victory on Thursday was a win-win for Chicago, as the franchise owns the first-round pick of the Panthers (1-8).

Bears vs. Panthers results, highlights from Thursday Night Football

(All times Eastern)

Final: Bears 16, Panthers 13

11:11 p.m. — And now this one is officially over. The Bears pick up their third win of the season, while Carolina drops to 1-8 and faces more tough questions about Bryce Young and the offense.

11:08 p.m. — Bagent hits Mooney for the first down on 3rd & 7, and the Panthers now won't be able to stop the clock.

11:06 p.m. — Pineiro's attempt is SHORT from 59 yards out. The gamble fails for Frank Reich. The Panthers will hope to get the ball back.

11:04 p.m. — Young is very nearly intercepted on 3rd & 10, and the Panthers say they've seen enough of the offense. Eddy Pineiro is attempting a 59-yard field goal to tie the game.

11:00 p.m. — Miles Sanders gets himself wide open on fourth down to extend the drive. The Panthers are 3-for-3 on fourth down tonight despite their severe struggles for much of the game.

10:58 p.m. — It'll be fourth and about two yards when the Panthers return from the two-minute warning... Carolina is trying to claw its way into field goal range.

10:57 p.m. — Thielen comes through with a nice catch on the run to give Carolina another first down.

10:56 p.m. — Hayden Hurst with a bad drop on 2nd & 3. That would've opened up the field a bit for the Panthers.

10:54 p.m. — Young drops back on 4th & Inches from deep in his own territory, but fortunately for Carolina he's able to run to the right and pick up the first down. The Panthers still have plenty of ground to cover to get into field goal range.

10:52 p.m. — The tush-push doesn't work for everyone. The Panthers try to push Chuba Hubbard forward on 3rd & 1, and he goes nowhere. It looks like they'll go for it again.

10:49 p.m. — Deion Jones makes a great tackle to drop Roschon Johnson for a three-yard loss. The Bears will punt, giving the Panthers a chance to tie the game or more.

10:46 p.m. — Bagent finds Kmet for a first down and more. Another nice play by Kmet, who has become a trusted target for Bagent in these four starts for the rookie.

Bears 16, Panthers 13

10:42 p.m. FIELD GOAL — Pineiro's kick is good, and the Panthers now trail by a field goal.

10:41 p.m. — Young's pass to Marshall is incomplete on third down. Marshall was well-defended, but he probably should've had that. It'll be a field goal try for Carolina.

10:38 p.m. — You have to give some credit to Carolina's offense for converting, as Young finds Tremble for the first down on 4th & 6. The Panthers turn a 1st & 30 into a fresh set of downs.

10:37 p.m. — A neutral zone infraction pulls the Panthers a bit closer, and they will line up to go for it on 4th & 6...

End of third quarter: Bears 16, Panthers 10

10:32 p.m. — The Panthers run it with Chuba Hubbard on 1st & 30. They're not showing much interest in letting Bryce Young air it out, even while trailing in a lost season.

10:31 p.m. — It's 1st & 30 for the Panthers after back-to-back penalties. That's one way to erase great field position.

10:29 p.m. — A less than impressive punt by Trenton Gill sets up Carolina well inside Bears territory. If there was ever a time for the Panthers' offense to get something going...

10:28 p.m. — After an offensive pass interference call backs up the Bears, Chicago shows no interest in taking a shot and hands it off on 3rd & 19. The Panthers will have solid field position.

10:26 p.m. — The Bears come out with three Foreman runs in four plays. After turnovers doomed them last week, they're playing it conservatively.

10:21 p.m. — Young throws behind the line of scrimmage on 3rd & 15, which doesn't tend to convert. It'll be a Panthers punt, giving the Bears poor field position in the process.

10:19 p.m. — Now Young hits Adam Thielen for another first down. How about that? Carolina is just about to midfield.

10:18 p.m. — A rare first down for the Panthers as Young throws to Marshall for an 11-yard gain.

Bears 16, Panthers 10

10:13 p.m. TOUCHDOWN — Foreman runs it in for the score! That's the first offensive touchdown of the night, and it gives the Bears their first lead of the night.

10:12 p.m. — A well-designed play is broken up by Donte Jackson in the end zone after the Bears pick up the first down.

10:11 p.m. — The Bears are inching their way toward the goal line...it's 3rd & 1 from the five.

10:10 p.m. — Foreman runs 11 yards for a first down, and the Bears are already in field goal range thanks to strong starting field position.

10:06 p.m. — Outside of a 45-yard completion to Mike Strachan, Young is 7-of-16 for 24 yards. It's tough to recall any positive moments for the Panthers' offense tonight aside from that one play. Carolina has serious questions to answer.

10:05 p.m. — Young gets a few yards back but is sacked by Yannick Ngakoue on third down. The Panthers will punt again.

10:04 p.m. — Bryce Young is now lining up in his own end zone after Miles Sanders was dropped for a six-yard loss.

10:01 p.m. — Punt. Again.

9:57 p.m. — The Panthers get a grand total of one yard (-4 including a delay of game penalty) and punt it away less than a minute into the first half.

End of first half: Panthers 10, Bears 9

9:40 p.m. FIELD GOAL — In a game that might be lucky to see an offensive touchdown, the Bears deserve some credit for that drive to work their way into field goal range. They trail 10-9 at the half.

9:39 p.m. — Bagent narrowly avoids a sack and actually runs for positive yardage to move Santos' attempt closer. Chicago is down to three seconds, so here comes Santos.

9:38 p.m. — A perfectly executed play to get the ball to Cole Kmet, who picks up the first down and then some but still gets out of bounds to stop the clock. The Bears are in field goal range.

9:37 p.m. — The Panthers could use this D.J. Moore guy. Moore with a 14-yard grab to take the Bears into Carolina territory and give Chicago a real chance at points here. 46 seconds left.

9:34 p.m. — The Bears still have plenty of ground to make up to get into field goal range, but a 15-yard unnecessary roughness penalty on Deion Jones helps inch them closer.

9:29 p.m. — Tyrique Stevenson comes VERY close to a interception on an errant pass by Young, and the Panthers will punt with just over a minute left in the half.

9:28 p.m. — An illegal contact penalty, the second of the night on the Bears, gives Carolina a fresh set of downs.

9:25 p.m. — The Panthers will have 3rd & 3 out of the two-minute warning, just hoping to get in position for some points before halftime. They'll start the second half with the ball as well.

Panthers 10, Bears 6

9:19 p.m. FIELD GOAL — Bagent is fortunate just to hold onto a bad snap, but his pass is incomplete and brings out Cairo Santos. It's 10-6, Panthers.

9:17 p.m. — A second big play by rookie Tyler Scott, who catches a 15-yard pass from Bagent to give the Bears a fresh set of downs. Chicago is into field goal range.

9:14 p.m. — Bagent hits Roschon Johnson for a first down to give the Bears some life. Chicago started with very strong field position, so this could quickly become a rare scoring opportunity.

9:11 p.m. — A sack by Justin Jones quickly ends the Panthers' drive. Three-and-out for Carolina.

9:07 p.m. — A promising drive ends in a punt for the Bears. Carolina has a chance to extend its lead to two possessions if Bryce Young can build on that 44-yard completion he had last time he was on the field.

9:03 p.m. — After Foreman pushes forward for a key first down, rookie Tyler Scott takes off for 16 yards to take the Bears over midfield. Chicago is looking to tie the game on this drive.

9:00 p.m. — Sexiest Man Alive Jason Kelce is in the booth with Al Michaels and Kirk Herbstreit to start the second quarter.

Panthers 10, Bears 3

8:55 p.m. FIELD GOAL — Young comes under pressure on 3rd & 11 and just throws it into the ground. Former Bears kicker Eddy Pineiro drills the field goal, so Carolina still adds to its lead.

End of first quarter: Panthers 7, Bears 3

8:50 p.m. — Young throws downfield and hits Mike Strachan for a 44-yard gain. Mike Strachan? Mike Strachan. The Panthers are suddenly in business in Bears territory.

8:45 p.m. — Santos drills it anyway! A 54-yard kick. The Bears cut the deficit to 7-3.

8:44 p.m. — A false start by Cody Whitehair erases what would've been a good 49-yard field goal...the Bears will keep Cairo Santos out there.

8:43 p.m. — Chicago will try a field goal from 49 yards out after the drive fizzles out.

8:41 p.m. — Foreman has been the Bears' best weapon tonight. He rips off an 11-yard run and now has 43 scrimmage yards in this first quarter.

8:40 p.m. — The Bears rattle off two first downs on their first three plays, with Moore and Foreman grabbing passes from Bagent to take Chicago over midfield.

Panthers 7, Bears 0

8:36 p.m. TOUCHDOWN — Ihmir Smith-Marsette returns the punt 79 yards for a touchdown! On a night that could be defined by bad offense, the Panthers get a huge early boost from their special teams unit. Carolina leads, 7-0.

8:33 p.m. — Darnell Mooney goes for a first down after a nice run by D'Onta Foreman set up a 3rd & 2. The Bears have some breathing room.

8:29 p.m. — Johnny Hekker pins the Bears at the one, so it'll be an uphill battle for Bagent and the offense on this upcoming drive.

8:28 p.m. — Young is forced to throw it away on third down, so he Panthers will punt from just past midfield.

8:26 p.m. — Young misses a wide open Terrace Marshall Jr. on second down, sailing the pass too high.

8:25 p.m. — Two third downs, two scrambles for a first down by Young. He's not exactly known for his mobility, but he's far from immobile. Now let's see whether the Panthers can get the passing game going at all.

8:23 p.m. — Nice awareness by Bryce Young to run for the first down on 3rd & 7, and the Panthers add five extra yards on an illegal contact penalty against Chicago.

8:21 p.m. — Donte Jackson comes through with a nice pass breakup on third down, and the Bears will punt shortly after the quick first down.

8:19 p.m. — D.J. Moore instantly makes an impact against his former team with a 16-yard grab.

8:17 p.m. — Bagent and the Bears offense will start with the ball, and we are underway!

8:09 p.m. — Perhaps the most interesting storyline tonight will be whether Al Michaels can keep a brave face throughout what might not be the most appealing game.

8:00 p.m. — We're going to keep spirits high tonight despite a matchup of teams with a combined three wins. All football is good football! Let's see how long this mentality lasts...

7:46 p.m. — It's 52 degrees and clear in Chicago right now, so certainly not as cold as it could be in the Windy City this time of year. Still, it's a rare colder-weather game for Bryce Young.

7:30 p.m. — The Bears will be donning orange tonight, including an alternate orange helmet.

7:10 p.m. — D.J. Moore is back facing his former team tonight, eight months after he was traded to the Bears in the deal that sent the No. 1 pick to Carolina.

6:50 p.m. — Standout edge rusher Brian Burns is out with a concussion, dealing a major blow to the Panthers' defense.

6:35 p.m. — Bryce Young threw an interception in only one of his last five games before crashing back to Earth with three picks against the Colts last week. More than ever, it feels like this game will be won by the quarterback who can avoid turnovers. Bagent has thrown five picks in his last two starts.

6:15 p.m. — Tyson Bagent will get the start for the Bears tonight, so it'll be an undrafted rookie facing a rookie No. 1 pick. Despite that, Chicago is favored.

sports,Parnab Bhattacharya,2023-12-03T23:45:00+00:00,"The distance golf balls travel has increased multifold. So a change is necessary to address the issue. Otherwise, the golf courses need to be perpetually extended. Not us. This is the opinion of both Royal & Ancient (R&A) and United States Golf Association (USGA) officials who decided it’s time to bring in the golf ball rollback policy. According to them, with new technologies, golf balls are covering far more distance, resulting in lengthening the courses and incurring a greater financial burden on the golf clubs. Moreover, there are a growing number of voices who feel golf has become way less competitive nowadays.

On the other hand, there is a chance this might create bifurcation, which no one likes. The rules are non-binding in nature. So, tours and regional governing bodies can decide for themselves whether to implement them or not. Regardless, suppose R&A and USGA, which organize 35 championships between themselves, put this into action, and PGA and other Tours reject them. In that case, amateurs might be playing with ‘corrected’ balls, while the Tour pros will be playing with the same balls. Steeped in rich irony, indeed. Although the proposed rules are not set to be implemented before at least 2026, let’s explore the existing complications.

What happens to the majors with the rollback policy?

If they pass the rules, the R&A that organizes The Open and the USGA, the organizer of the U.S. Open, will have the limited-flight balls in these two majors. What about the others? That’s for the Augusta National and PGA of America to decide.

Notably, Seth Waugh, the PGA of America CEO, in a memo to R&A, denounced the proposals, taking along nine other PGAs across the globe. While Fred Ridley, the chairman of Augusta National, didn’t exactly bang the drum for MLR, the former amateur golfer did stand behind the governing bodies, saying he would much prefer to see the issue finally addressed. Notably, Augusta infamously ‘Tiger-proofed’ their course to make it ‘tougher’ for golfers (read Tiger Woods).

One thing should be noted here. Although R&A and USGA both organize two LPGA majors, the Women’s Open and the U.S. Women’s Open, respectively, the rules will apply only to two men’s golf. Why? Because the average driving distance on the LPGA Tour is still well within the accepted norm of the two regulatory bodies. We haven’t heard any noise from the female circuit, even though Lexi Thompson shot a 316-yard drive at the Shrines Children’s Open. But the PGA Tour Pros and LIV Golf Pros chimed in with their thoughts.

What do players think of this?

Most players are less than happy with the change. And that reaction cut across the LIV Golf-PGA Tour divide. Justin Thomas, a fifteen-time winner on the Tour who is also a part of the PGA Tour policy board, termed it “selfish” on the USGA’s part. “I think the USGA over the years has, in my eyes, it’s harsh but made some pretty selfish decisions,” he stated. “They definitely, in my mind, have done a lot of things that aren’t for the betterment of the game, although they claim it.”

The 2022 PGA Championship winner drew an interesting comparison. In the NBA, players now jump much higher than they did in the 1990s. But the hoop height has stayed the same at 10 feet above the playing surface. The two-time Major winner credits the player’s grind for this.

What Is the Model Local Rule? As the Golf Ball Rollback Debate Takes Off Once Again, All You Need To Know About the USGA?s and R&A?s Brainchild

Echoing similar sentiments, Bryson DeChambeau, who joined LIV Golf in 2022, said, “It’s a great handicap for us guys that have worked really hard to learn how to hit it farther.” The 2020 U.S. Open Champion regularly crushes drives to 310–320 yards. No wonder he termed the policy “atrocious.”

Interestingly, Rory McIlroy, whose average of 326.7 yards puts him on top of the PGA Tour’s driving distance leaderboard, backed this proposal for elite-level golfers. Speaking to the No Laying Up Podcast, the five-time Major winner said, “I think it’s going to help the overall professional game. I think making guys hit some long irons again and some mid irons and being able to hit every club in your bag in a round of golf.”

What does the Big Cat have to say about this? After all, it was Tiger Woods, whose astounding power behind the shots in the late 90s and early 2000s started the debate. Surprisingly, the fifteen-time major winner feels a course correction is necessary here. “I think this should have happened a long time ago.”

In fact, he said something that might not sit well with most, “I’ve been of the position if you play in a pro event or you have a P next to your name, you should be playing a pro ball. If you have an A next to your name and you’re playing an amateur event, you should use an amateur ball.”

How will the golf ball rollback policy affect LIV golfers?

The R&A and USGA have not made it binding on any governing bodies to implement the rules. For the breakaway league, this is the easiest path. One reason is that power hitters such as Bryson DeChambeau will be affected in more ways than one otherwise.

Secondly, a league that thrives on thrills and excitement will lose its USP if the ball suddenly doesn’t travel 300 yards on most occasions. As of this year, 28 of 48 LIV golfers average over 300 yards driving distance. Dustin Johnson and DeChambeau are both in the top five.

But one crucial thing to remember here is that the golf ball rollback policy will render most balls totally ‘unplayable’. Moreover, the PGA Tour has contradicted itself several times in the past few years. It won’t be surprising if Monahan & Co. eventually decides to agree with the policy change sometime later. So, the question remains: how viable would it be for manufacturers to produce two types of balls, one for Majors and the other for LIV Golf? This just throws the world of golf into uncharted territory.

sports,Christy Doran,2023-10-10T23:06:29+00:00,"In the wake of the Wallabies’ World Cup flop, the Queensland Rugby Union have reaffirmed their position that they are committed to moving to a centralised high-performance model but won’t follow the NSW Waratahs by handing over the keys to Rugby Australia.

They also expressed their strong support for Rugby Australia to conduct a “fully independent and transparent top-to-bottom review of the Wallabies program and how it can be improved” in light of the historic first World Cup pool exit.

They added: “It should also provide a clear view of what is needed in a leadership and governance framework to ensure we put the right people, in the right roles, in the right system.”

The QRU has also expressed their desire for Rugby Australia to reinstate the annual $1.7 million in funding to each of the Super Rugby franchises that was withdrawn following the Covid pandemic to help keep the game afloat.

In the open letter to their members on Wednesday morning, QRU chief executive David Hanham and chairman Brett Clark moved to update constituents on the reform measures that RA is attempting to usher through the game.

Last week, The Roar revealed that the New South Wales Rugby Union was in the latter stages of handing over their license to RA.

By doing so, the NSW Waratahs, who were on the brink of insolvency, handed over their commercial and high-performance property.

The decision will see all male and female Waratahs players, including coaches and high-performance staff, as well as all commercial and operations staff, run out of RA’s office.

NSW Waratahs chief executive Paul Doorn informed stakeholders of the decision last week.

RA is cognisant that not every Super Rugby franchise will follow suit immediately, but the governing body is hopeful that now one of the two biggest states has agreed to hand over the keys, others will follow suit swiftly. The Melbourne Rebels are expected to follow.

RA chief executive Phil Waugh says building trust back between the governing body and states is essential to their plans.

Under fire Wallabies coach Eddie Jones also advocated for Australian rugby to move to a centralised model, believing the nation had fallen behind the rest of the world.

“We’re a state-based union that’s run by the states, the national union wants to assume more responsibility and when things were going well, no one questioned that,” Jones said.

“But over the last period of time, they haven’t been going so well and this tournament’s probably been the icing on the cake where it’s got to a stage where I think people, most people probably think there’s time for change. But it’s not going to go easy.

“[It’s] one of the key issues. We need to maximize the development of the players. At the end of the day, that’s the key to success and alignment of your resources, for a small country.

“Because Australia, if you look at the history of rugby, when we were amateur, we were probably ahead of the game because we had the influence of rugby league. We had the influence of AFL and our players were more professional than the rest of the world.”

He added: “I know what’s going on and we need to get a better system of developing players. We need to develop better players and we need to develop a larger batch of better players and that only comes through changing the whole system.”

While all five Australian Super Rugby sides fundamentally are on board with regards to moving to a centralised high-performance program, The Roar added that some states, including the ACT Brumbies as well as the QRU, don’t want to give up their commercial assets.

The QRU confirmed that on Wednesday morning.

“The QRU is committed to working with Rugby Australia to lead reform of our game at a high-performance level, and help Rugby Australia develop an improved game through high-performance centralisation,” the statement read.

“Centralisation” would include a national player-contracting model, and alignment of key high-performance staff, such as coaching, strength and conditioning, and medical to operate as one national system.”

The letter pointed to RA’s involvement in Les Kiss’ appointment as Reds coach, with the former State of Origin winger turned coach, who has spent the best part of two decades coaching in Ireland and England, replacing Brad Thorn.

As The Roar has previously reported, the QRU stopped short of wanting to hand over its commercial property.

“While the QRU is very supportive of high-performance alignment, it will not agree to any proposal on centralising commercial or corporate functions,” the letter read.

“The very strength of our State unions is the expertise they bring in their own markets.

“We are open to work on commercial initiatives together but will always retain our independence for the benefit of Queensland Rugby, its members and stakeholders.

“Queensland Rugby has built a sustainable business model through the elimination of legacy operating debt, delivered four-straight operating profits and worked in partnership with Governments to successfully deliver $31 million of improvements to Ballymore through the construction of the National Rugby Training Centre, the home of the Wallaroos and Queensland Reds.”

The letter also pointed to the 71,000 players across the state, including more than 16,000 of those female participants, 257 schools featuring rugby as part of its program, as well as its Hospital Cup competition and regional club competitions, as evidence that the game was in good health in Queensland.

The QRU also expressed its satisfaction that RA was willing to discuss the annual $1.7m being reinstated, which had been withheld because of the Covid pandemic to keep the game afloat.

Meanwhile, The Roar understands the ACT Brumbies have sent RA confirmation of solvency for the next 12 months.

RA was forced to take out a $40m loan from Ares to keep the game afloat.

While RA has around another $15m left to spend from the loan, the governing body is looking to borrow up to another $60m so they’re in the strongest possible position to capitalise on the two major money-making events – the 2025 British and Irish Lions series and home men’s World Cup in 2017 – and succeed.

RA is also in the early stages of looking to renew its next broadcast deal, with the governing body hoping to at least double its current deal with Nine Entertainment/Stan Sport, which is seeing them paid $29m per year until the end of 2025.","‘Right people in right roles’: QRU breaks silence on RA’s reform hopes, backs review into Wallabies’ RWC flop",https://www.theroar.com.au/2023/10/11/right-people-in-right-roles-qru-breaks-silence-on-ras-reform-hopes-backs-review-into-wallabies-rwc-flop/,The Roar | Sports Writers Blog
sports,Christy Doran,2023-12-11T22:30:02+00:00,"Rugby Australia is moving closer to naming their new director of high-performance, with World Rugby’s director of high-performance Peter Horne set to take on the role – and the move could help land highly-regarded coach Joe Schmidt for the vacant Wallabies job.

As The Roar reported last week, Horne had emerged as the leading candidate in recent weeks.

It’s believed he has edged out former Sydney University, Australian Sevens and Harlequins’ director of rugby Billy Millard for the role.

Facebook Twitter Whatsapp Reddit Email Share

The finer points of the negotiations are being out, but it’s likely Horne will be announced over the next week once the sports administrator wraps up a crucial series of meetings this week with World Rugby.

Horne is leading World Rugby meetings with tier-two nations this week in Sydney, with former Fiji coach Simon Raiwalui in attendance before he officially wraps up and joins World Rugby.

His appointment reflects RA’s desire to go down an administrative path rather than former coach of any standing like Millard would have offered.

Horne, who joined World Rugby in 2015 as a general manager of high-performance before moving into his current role, will sit at the top of the high-performance tree, with the next Wallabies coach to report into him.

Advertisement

During his tenure with World Rugby, the Sydneysider has played an important role in setting up competitions, high-performance structures and pathways across developing countries.

He also played a role in helping Super Rugby integrate Fiji Drua and Moana Pasifika into the competition.

Those successes played out in the recent Rugby World Cup, with Chili, Fiji, Georgia and Portugal delivering encouraging performances that positively reflected World Rugby’s desire to spread and build the game. Horne briefly worked at Saracens as a general manger.

RA always said they wanted to have the role filled by Christmas, with chief-executive Phil Waugh saying the successful candidate had one of the biggest jobs to change the game’s standing in Australia.

“It’s a big job,” Waugh said. “It’s the biggest job on my leadership team in terms of the impact it has on the general sentiment around the game.”

Horne will oversee all of Australia’s men’s and women’s high-performance programs.

Advertisement

He will also be tasked with “integrating” the programs, with RA trying to centralise all of the Super Rugby’s high-performance programs.

Perhaps most pressing will be building a list of coaching candidates to take over from Eddie Jones, with RA wanting to have the new Wallabies coach set in stone by the start of Super Rugby.

Horne’s close relationship with former Ireland coach and All Blacks assistant Joe Schmidt could be one of the keys to landing the 2018 World Rugby coach of the year.

After leaving his Irish post after six years following the 2019 World Cup, Schmidt worked alongside Horne at World Rugby.

It’s believed the duo have a strong working relationship.

While Schmidt’s Irish side bombed out in successive quarter-finals under his leadership, the New Zealander took the Emerald Isle to the top of World Rugby’s rankings.

Along the way, Schmidt played an instrumental role in not just seeing them become one of the world’s best teams but helped usher through transformational change off the field, as Ireland moved to a centralised system.

Advertisement

Schmidt briefly exited the international coaching scene following the 2019 World Cup, citing a desire to move home to New Zealand to be closer to his family.

But after initially moving back into the coaching fray with the Blues in Super Rugby, he joined the All Blacks ahead of last year’s Rugby Championship as New Zealand Rugby shook the All Blacks coaching team up following their historic series loss to Andy Farrell’s Irish.

Schmidt’s expertise proved telling, with he and Jason Ryan transforming the All Blacks and helping Ian Foster’s side reach the final of this year’s World Cup after stunning wins over Ireland and Argentina in the knockout stages.

Importantly, the 58-year-old, The Roar understands, is interested in the Wallabies coaching job.

Dan McKellar, Stephen Larkham, Andy Friend and Ian Foster remain interested in the role.

Should RA move on him, Schmidt’s backing would be largely supported by the Super Rugby franchises, with several sources telling The Roar that the experienced coach is exactly the type of person the Wallabies need.

Advertisement

After a year in where the Wallabies’ detail and nous was clearly absent on the field, the highly detailed Schmidt would help bring rugby smarts to the Australian program.

Indeed, the manipulation and ability to play both sides of the ruck was clearly visible by Ireland during his Irish tenure.

What’s more, should RA go down a path of bringing Schmidt into the fold, his own relationship with Ireland’s long-time director of high-performance David Nucifora could see the Australian reconsider his position with the governing body.

Last year Nucifora told The Roar he would unlikely consider returning to RA when he leaves his post with Ireland following next year’s Olympics.

“I don’t think it’d be wise to revisit,” Nucifora said.

“I think that you have a go at something once, you do your best and then if it’s not good enough or it didn’t work you move on, do something else.

Advertisement

“What’s changed back there that I could think that, what I can offer, can change what they’re doing still?

“I’ll always love rugby. I’ll always love Australian rugby. Could I see myself working in Australia again? I doubt it.”

But RA have been making moves to try and twist Nucifora’s arm.

While Nucifora was never in the running for the director of high-performance, it’s understood they are trying to get him on board as a consultant when he wraps up with Ireland.",RA set to announce local as high-performance director – and how it could help land Schmidt as Wallabies coach,https://www.theroar.com.au/2023/12/12/ra-set-to-announce-local-as-high-performance-director-and-how-it-could-help-land-schmidt-as-wallabies-coach/,The Roar | Sports Writers Blog
sports,Sloan Piva,2023-11-21T21:33:00+00:00,"As we trot into Turkey Day week, only three more regular-season weeks remain until the fantasy football playoffs. Every decision — from the tough starts to the difficult sits; the savvy waiver adds to the costly drops — can ultimately decide whether your team is a contender or a pretender. Our Week 12 fantasy RB rankings for standard leagues will help guide you to the right moves and hopefully land you a big ""W"" for which to be thankful.

Trade deadlines have passed in most leagues, so the majority of fantasy owners must soldier on toward the home stretch with the main core they have built to this point. On a positive note, we have no byes to worry about this — just plenty of short turnarounds, some potential weather concerns, and of course, the dreaded injury bug. Fortunately for us, we have been ahead of the curve with sleepers and breakouts all season, so we're more prepared to weather any storm than the average fantasy Joe.

Let's get right to our Week 12 RB rankings so you can fully prepare for Thanksgiving week and put out a lineup with backs who will feast like the rest of us.

Which RBs are on bye in Week 12?

None! It's a Thanksgiving miracle! Not only do we not have any byes to worry about this week, but we also have NFL action on four different days (Thursday, Friday, Sunday, Monday).

WEEK 12 STANDARD RANKINGS:

QBs | WRs | TEs | D/STs | Kickers

In some ways, however, a bye-free week at this stage of the season presents more challenges than ever. Whereas byes make some start 'em, sit 'em decisions no-brainers, 16-game weeks make it a lot easier to get lineup decisions wrong. Don't worry — we'll steer you in the right direction and keep you apprised of all the information you'll need throughout the week.

WEEK 12 PPR RANKINGS:

QBs | RBs | WRs | TEs | D/STs | Kickers

Who are the best fantasy RBs in Week 12?

As always, Christian McCaffrey (@ Seahawks in Week 12) heads the list as the most matchup-proof running back in the NFL. Right behind him, Austin Ekeler (vs. Ravens) will look to bounce back after an uncharacteristically rough showing in Green Bay last week.

Against the Commanders last week, Saquon Barkley (vs. Patriots) looked as good as we've seen him this season (140 total yards, two TDs). The Pats have surrendered 116 scrimmage yards per game and nine total TDs to RBs this season, so we like Barkley to pick up where he left off this Sunday (drive up that free-agency value, 'Quon!).

You don't see running mates cracking the top five very often, but we had to make the exception for David Montgomery and Jahmyr Gibbs (vs. Packers). Entering Week 11, Green Bay had surrendered nearly 140 all-purpose yards per game to RBs. Between Detroit's o-line, the Lions' high-flying offensive attack, and the ruthless 1-2 punch DMont and Gibbs have been this season, the feast could be on very early for Dan Campbell's guys.

Take a collective sigh of relief, Tony Pollard (vs. Commanders) owners! TP looked solid against Carolina last week, averaging 5.1 yards per carry and finally getting into the end zone for the first time since Week 1. We have the Cowboys back just outside our top five with a juicy matchup against a Washington D that just got lit up by Saquon and the G-men.

Raheem Mostert (@ Jets) should continue to eat for Miami, with rookie De'Von Achane (knee) unfortunately getting hurt almost immediately after returning from IR (more on that later). Gang Green hasn't been nearly as good against the run as it has been against the pass, as Jets opponents have averaged 139 rushing yards per game over the past two weeks. 'Fins backup Salvon Ahmed also landed on the IR with a foot injury, so consider stashing Jeff Wilson Jr. as a handcuff.

Rounding out the top 10, the trio of Travis Etienne (@ Texans), Josh Jacobs (vs. Chiefs), and Breece Hall (vs. Dolphins) will be looking to bounce back from disappointing Week 11 outings on the ground. All three of these backs have been mostly solid, and none have much to worry about in terms of backfield competition.

WEEK 12 FANTASY ADVICE:

Sleepers | Busts | Projections | Start-sit

Who are the best fantasy RB sleepers, waiver pickups in Week 12?

Sleep on Rhamondre Stevenson (@ Giants) at your own peril. 'Mondre has accumulated 231 yards from scrimmage and a TD over New England's past two games, and the Pats are coming off bye. Washington just carved the G-men up like a turkey on the ground last week, surrendering a whopping 174 yards and a TD. Gobble gobble.

Get Kyren Williams (@ Cardinals) right back into your lineup the moment Los Angeles activates him from IR. Arizona just made Devin Singletary look like Barry Sanders, so Williams (ankle) should enjoy a triumphant return to the field. Keep rolling with Alexander Mattison (vs. Bears), too, against another below-average run defense.

Welcome to the top 25, Zach Charbonnet (vs. 49ers)! With Kenneth Walker III's oblique injury comes opportunity for the rookie, who already looked strong in the month leading up to Seattle's narrow Week 11 loss to the Rams. Sure, Charbs' 69-yard effort in Los Angeles last week was a bit underwhelming, but we love his upside with a full game as the Seahawks' bell-cow.

Speaking of bell-cow backs, things are looking very promising for the short-term workload of Green Bay's AJ Dillon (@ Lions). Veteran Aaron Jones (knee) and rookie Emanuel Wilson (shoulder) both got hurt in Week 11, so Dillon should be the main man in Motown for the Pack. Power backs have enjoyed the most success against the Lions, as evidenced last week by Chicago's Roschon Johnson averaging 5.0 yards per carry and D'Onta Foreman finding paydirt.

WEEK 12 DFS:

DK lineup | FD lineup | Best values | Best stacks

Who are the biggest potential RB busts in Week 12?

We don't quite have the intestinal fortitude to bench Derrick Henry (vs. Panthers), but we must absolutely temper our expectations with the dude at this point. Over the past two weeks, he has tallied just 64 total yards on 23 touches (2.8 yards per touch). Carolina served as Tony Pollard's get-right game last week, so fire King Henry up if you have him. If he falters against the Panthers, you better have a backup plan moving forward (picking up Tyjae Spears as insurance is a good place to start).

Both Darrell Henderson and Royce Freeman (@ Cardinals) would be decent dart throws in a week filled with byes, but their floors in a zero-bye week seem too low to trust them if Kyren Williams is back and at 100 percent. The matchup is juicy, but we have no idea what to expect from a touch-share perspective, so these guys are no better than desperation, TD-dependent flexes.

Speaking of guys coming back from injury, we saw Khalil Herbert (@ Vikings) return to the field for Chicago against the Lions last week. However, his performance left a lot to be desired. He finished with just 35 yards on 16 carries and wound up vastly overshadowed by Justin Field's 100-yard rushing effort. Even worse, D'Onta Foreman scored the Chi's lone rushing TD on the afternoon.

I don't care what your team looks like — you shouldn't be starting Chuba Hubbard or Miles Sanders (@ Titans). They weren't awful against Dallas last week on a per-touch basis, but neither finished with more than 12 touches. Even worse, no Carolina back has enjoyed a 60-yard rushing game since Oct. 15. Bad offensive line, negative game scripts, awful coaching — it's all bad, man!

What are the biggest RB injuries in Week 12?

Second-year Seahawks back Kenneth Walker III suffered an oblique injury in Week 11 that the ever-hip Pete Carroll referred to as ""legit."" KW3 has a better chance of missing multiple weeks than he does at suiting up for Seattle's Thanksgiving Day game against Fred Warner and the 49ers. If Zach Charbonnet somehow finds himself on your waiver wire, an early Merry Christmas to you if you have the FAAB or a high waiver priority.

The hits just keep on coming for the Packers' Aaron Jones, who suffered a knee injury but seems to have at least caught a break in the sense that he didn't tear his ACL. However, even a moderate MCL sprain could mean a multi-week absence for the injury-prone veteran back, especially in a lost season for the 4-6 Pack. Rookie Emanuel Wilson also hurt his shoulder in Week 11, so AJ Dillon could be getting the keys to Green Bay's backfield castle (although it's more of an oversized shack, at this point).

Dolphins rookie De'Von Achane, who looked like the runaway Offensive Rookie of the Year earlier this season, looked to have aggravated his MCL injury upon his Week 11 return against the Raiders. Achane has a chance to return for Miami's Week 12 tilt with the Jets on Friday, but we wouldn't be surprised if the 7-3 'Fins play it safe and keep him out until he's back to 100 percent. Meanwhile, Miami placed backup Salvon Ahmed on IR with a foot injury, so Jeff Wilson Jr. could be back in play as a handcuff stash.

Bears veteran D'Onta Foreman injured his ankle in Week 11. He could miss some time now that Khalil Herbert and Roschon Johnson are both back in action for Chicago. The best runner on the Bears, however, is QB Justin Fields when he's active.

Texans back Dameon Pierce returned to practice late last week, but he remained out with his ankle injury against the Cardinals. We could see him return to the field this weekend, but for now, we're keeping him off our rankings until we hear more positive news. Either way, it seems Devin Singletary is the new RB1 in this breakout offense.

We'll be updating these standard RB rankings all week, so check back for the latest player movement.

sports,Kyle Irving,2023-10-30T22:00:02+00:00,"The Rangers continue to be unstoppable road warriors.

Texas picked up its ninth consecutive road victory in these playoffs after defeating the Diamondbacks in Game 3 of the World Series, 3-1.

The Rangers were powered by some two-out magic in the third inning, as Marcus Semien finally found his bat with an RBI single before Corey Seager demolished a two-run home run 421 feet to right field.

Jon Gray got credited with the win after Max Scherzer was pulled from the contest with a lower back injury through three scoreless innings. Gray was fantastic in a surprise relief appearance, throwing three scoreless innings with three strikeouts and just one hit allowed.

The Diamondbacks' offense struggled to string together hits and couldn't cash in when they had runners in scoring position. Even though they out-hit the Rangers, Arizona's bats hardly put any pressure on Texas' pitching.

10:51 p.m.: Bottom of 9th — Gabriel Moreno thought he had a lead-off walk but the home plate umpire saw it as a strike even though it was off the plate. Moreno grounded out to third on the next pitch. A tough break for the Diamondbacks.

10:49 p.m.: Bottom of 9th — Rangers closer José Leclerc is in to try and secure the save.

10:46 p.m.: Top of 9th — Nathaniel Lowe hit a comebacker at Andrew Saalfrank but the ball ricocheted right to Ketel Marte who pitched it to Christian Walker to end the inning.

10:44 p.m.: Top of 9th — Jonah Heim struck out swinging and with two outs, that'll do it for Luis Frias. LHP Andrew Saalfrank will come in to face LHH Nathaniel Lowe to try and close out the inning.

10:39 p.m.: Top of 9th — Mitch Garver flew out to center and the Diamondbacks almost caught Evan Carter slipping, nearly doubling up the rookie at first. Arizona challenged to see if Carter touched second base on his way back but the challenge was unsuccessful.

10:35 p.m.: Top of 9th — The Diamondbacks are sticking with Luis Frias, but he walked Evan Carter to start the inning.

Eighth inning: Rangers 3, Diamondbacks 1

10:31 p.m.: Bottom of 8th — And Aroldis Chapman escapes trouble! Corey Seager makes a great backhand play on a grounder from Ketel Marte, setting up a 6-4-3 double play to end the inning. The Rangers remain in the lead 3-1.

WOW. 🤯



What a double play to get out of the inning!!



📺: FOX pic.twitter.com/zslK4k9L6X — FOX Sports: MLB (@MLBONFOX) October 31, 2023

10:30 p.m.: Bottom of 8th — Aroldis Chapman gets Corbin Carroll to strike out looking, freezing the star rookie on a filthy slider.

10:26 p.m.: Bottom of 8th — Geraldo Perdomo drives in Emmanuel Rivera! The No. 8 and 9 spots in Arizona's lineup deliver as Perdomo rips an RBI single into left. Here comes the top of the order with no outs. Rangers lead 3-1.

10:25 p.m.: Bottom of 8th — The pinch-hit decision pays off as Emmanuel Rivera drives a double down the line in right. Let's see if the Diamondbacks can finally cash in.

10:20 p.m.: Bottom of 8th — LHP Aroldis Chapman is coming in for Josh Sborz. The Diamondbacks were going to pinch-hit LHH Pavin Smith for Evan Longoria but once the Rangers elected to bring in Chapman, Arizona pivoted to RHH Emmanuel Rivera.

10:19 p.m.: Bottom of 8th — Adolis Garcia is leaving the game with an oblique injury. Travis Janowski will take his place in right field.

10:15 p.m.: Top of 8th — Luis Frias does his job, sending down the Rangers' top of the order with ease. Marcus Semien grounded out to second, Corey Seager struck out swinging and Adolis Garcia flew out to center. Something to monitor: Garcia came up holding his left side after the swing that ended the inning.

Seventh inning: Rangers 3, Diamondbacks 0

10:03 p.m.: Bottom of 7th — Christian Walker grounded out to second to start the inning but Tommy Pham injected some life in the Diamondbacks' crowd with a double to deep center. Lourdes Gurriel Jr. is coming to the plate with Alek Thomas on deck.

10:00 p.m.: Bottom of 7th — Jon Gray was rolling, but Bruce Bochy will elect to turn to RHP Josh Sborz for the bottom of the 7th. Gray was fantastic in a surprise relief appearance, delivering three scoreless innings with three K's and just one hit allowed.

9:58 p.m.: Top of 7th — Kyle Nelson sends the Rangers down in order. Nathaniel Lowe took him deep to the warning track but Lourdes Gurriel Jr. was there to track it down. Josh Jung grounded out to short and Leody Tavares grounded out to third.

9:53 p.m.: Top of 7th — LHP Kyle Nelson will enter the game for Miguel Castro with a couple of lefties, Nathaniel Lowe and Josh Jung, coming to the plate to start the inning.

Sixth inning: Rangers 3, Diamondbacks 0

9:49 p.m.: Bottom of 6th — The Diamondbacks picked up just their third hit of the game on a two-out Ketel Marte single on a line drive off of Marcus Semien's glove, but they failed to make any noise. Geraldo Perdomo and Corbin Carroll both struck out, and Gabriel Moreno flew out to right to end the inning.

9:42 p.m.: Top of 6th — Evan Carter punched a single to left but Miguel Castro worked his way out of a jam. Mitch Garver flew out to center and Jonah Heim grounded out to third, where Evan Longoria made a nice play and throw to get the runner in time.

9:35 p.m.: Top of 6th — Corey Seager flew out to center to start the inning but Brandon Pfaadt's night will be over after he issued a free pass to Adolis Garcia. Torey Lovullo will go to RHP Miguel Castro with Evan Carter coming to the plate.

Pfaadt finished with four strikeouts and three earned runs on four hits and two walks over 5.1 innings.

Fifth inning: Rangers 3, Diamondbacks 0

9:28 p.m.: Bottom of 5th — Jon Gray is cruising. Despite an impromptu appearance, the Rangers pitcher has sent down the first six batters he has faced. Lourdes Gurriel Jr. and Alek Thomas both grounded out and Evan Longoria popped out to first in foul play.

9:19 p.m.: Top of 5th — Brandon Pfaadt survives a lead-off walk to Nathaniel Lowe unscathed. He struck out Josh Jung, then Leody Tavares lined out to third and Marcus Semien grounded out to third to end the inning.

Fourth inning: Rangers 3, Diamondbacks 0

9:07 p.m.: Bottom of 4th — Jon Gray didn't need much time to settle in. He struck out Gabriel Moreno, Christian Walker grounded out to third and Tommy Pham flew out to center for an easy 1-2-3 inning.

9:03 p.m.: Bottom of 4th — An interesting development: Max Scherzer is being pulled from the game after just 36 pitches and three scoreless innings. Scherzer tried to take the mound for the bottom of the fourth but it appears he is being bothered by a lower back injury. It is unknown if the injury is correlated to the comebacker he took off of his lower back in the second inning. RHP Jon Gray will get the ball.

8:58 p.m.: Top of 4th — Brandon Pfaadt bounces back the way Arizona needed him to. He sends Evan Carter, Mitch Garver and Jonah Heim down in order, striking out Garver for Pfaadt's third K of the day.

Third inning: Rangers 3, Diamondbacks 0

8:51 p.m.: Bottom of 3rd — Max Scherzer assures the Diamondbacks don't answer right away, getting through the bottom of the 3rd with little resistance. He struck out Evan Longoria and got Geraldo Perdomo to fly out to right before issuing a two-out walk to Corbin Carroll. Carroll advanced to second on a wild pitch, but Scherzer got Ketel Marte to fly out to left to end the frame.

8:45 p.m.: Top of 3rd — Brandon Pfaadt got Adolis Garcia to strike out swinging to end the inning. The damage was limited to three runs.

8:43 p.m.: Top of 3rd — Corey Seager rips a two-run home run! The Rangers produce some two-out magic as Seager smokes an inside changeup 421 feet over the right field wall to give Texas a 3-0 lead.

8:41 p.m.: Top of 3rd — Marcus Semien comes up clutch with a single to left center! The star 2B has been struggling this postseason but he delivered here, driving in Nathaniel Lowe to give the Rangers a 1-0 lead.

8:39 p.m.: Top of 3rd — Brandon Pfaadt struck out Josh Jung swinging and got Leody Tavares to ground out to second but Nathaniel Lowe advanced to third. He is 90 feet away with two outs and Marcus Semien is coming to the plate.

8:36 p.m.: Top of 3rd — Nathaniel Lowe gets the Rangers going right away with a double to right center field.

Second inning: Rangers 0, Diamondbacks 0

8:30 p.m.: Bottom of 2nd — Lourdes Gurriel Jr. popped out to second, bringing Alek Thomas to the plate with two outs. Thomas ripped a line drive back at Max Scherzer, which ricocheted perfectly to 3B Josh Jung who made a laser throw to first to get Thomas out in time. What a bizarre inning.

8:27 p.m.: Bottom of 2nd — Adolis Garcia on the defensive end! Tommy Pham singled to right field and Christian Walker tried to score from second, but Garcia — who has one of the best outfield arms in baseball — hosed him at home plate to save a run. Pham advanced to second on the throw.

📺: FOX pic.twitter.com/wXM9RbieFp — FOX Sports: MLB (@MLBONFOX) October 31, 2023

8:25 p.m.: Bottom of 2nd — Christian Walker smoked a first-pitch fastball off the wall to right center for a double to lead off the bottom of the second.

8:22 p.m.: Top of 2nd — Rangers star rookie Evan Carter led off the top of the second with a hard-hit single to right center, but Mitch Garver topped a grounder to Brandon Pfaadt for a 1-4-3 double play. Jonah Heim flew out to center to end the inning. Pfaadt has only needed 18 pitches to get through his first six batters.

First inning: Rangers 0, Diamondbacks 0

8:15 p.m.: Bottom of 1st — Max Scherzer got Corbin Carroll to ground out to short, but he walked Ketel Marte to give the Diamondbacks the first baserunner of the game. Scherzer almost immediately avoided any trouble, forcing Gabriel Moreno to ground into a 5-4-3 double play two pitches later to end the inning.

8:08 p.m.: Top of 1st — Brandon Pfaadt breezes through the top of the Rangers' order with ease. Marcus Semien popped out to right, Corey Seager grounded out to first base on a first-pitch sinker and Adolis Garcia flew out to center. Pfaadt only needed 10 pitches to get through the top of the first.

Pregame

3:29 p.m.: After only scoring one run in Game 2, the Rangers will make a slight tweak to the lineup. Adolis Garcia will slide up to the No. 3 spot, with Evan Carter hitting clean-up. As Texas PR mentioned, Carter is the fifth-youngest player in World Series history to bat fourth, joining Juan Soto, Ty Cobb, Miguel Cabrera and Claudell Washington.

RHP Max Scherzer will get the start.

3:10 p.m.: The Diamondbacks will have Corbin Carroll return to the top of the lineup after leading off with Ketel Marte in Game 2. RHP Brandon Pfaadt will get the ball to start.

sports,Sam Eggleston,2023-10-02T23:49:35+00:00,"The NBA is one of the most popular sports to bet on in the US. NBA prop bets are an easy way to jump into basketball betting.

Proposition bets, or props, are easy to understand, numerous, and cover both player props and team props to give you plenty of variety.

Below, we look at betting NBA props at the best NBA betting sites and share some key information to make informed bets.

What are NBA props?

A prop bet is a side wager on an aspect of a game that usually doesn’t tie directly to the result. In the NBA, prop bets deal with both players and teams.

Some examples of NBA player props are:

How many points a player will score

Number of rebounds a player will have

How many assists a player will get

Rebounds and assists combined

Points, rebounds, and assists combined

How many steals a player will get

Number of three-pointers made

Some examples of NBA team props include:

Which team will reach 10 points first

Which team will have the highest-scoring period

Which team will score first

Which team will win the first half

Which team will win the second half

Will there be a fourth-quarter comeback victory

All of the best sports betting sites have their selection of prop bets for each NBA game, so shop around to find the sportsbooks that best suit your needs.

How to bet on NBA props

The first step to betting on NBA props is opening an account at an online sportsbook. The process is simple, free, and doesn’t take very long. Below are the steps to opening a new account at an online sportsbook.

Choose your sportsbook: Any state with legal online sports betting has a variety of sportsbooks. If you aren’t sure which sportsbooks best fit your needs, research and read our reviews on each. And don’t forget that you can have an account with more than one. Once you decide which sportsbook you’re interested in, follow the link from our site to qualify for the best new customer welcome bonus.

Register for an account: At the top of the homepage of the sportsbook website, you will find a button that says “register” or “sign up.” Click that, and you’ll be taken to a form you must fill out. It will ask for personal information such as your name, phone number, email address, last four digits of your Social Security number, and more.

Accept the terms and conditions: Before finalizing your account information, you must accept the sportsbook’s terms and conditions. We recommend you read through these to understand the rules your sportsbook will enforce regarding bets, especially for the sports you intend to wager on. The terms and conditions are also available on the sportsbook website for you to read at any point.

Get your bonus: At this point, you can accept your welcome bonus. Be sure to read through the bonus requirements before accepting anything. If a bonus code is needed, which you can find on our website, this is where you will input it during the registration process.

Make a deposit: Now that you’ve signed up for an account, you can start funding your bankroll by making a deposit. Most legal sportsbooks have a variety of ways you can add funds to your account, such as through your bank or an e-wallet.

Start betting: Go to the basketball section of your sportsbook and select the NBA. From there, you can choose individual games and make bets like money lines, point spreads, totals, props, futures, and more.

How to read NBA props odds

At first glance, all the positive and negative numbers at US sportsbooks can be daunting. The good news is they are easy to read once you understand what you see.

Negative numbers, such as -110, represent how much money you need to wager to win $100. In many cases, such as a moneyline bet, the negative number also indicates which side of the bet is the favorite to win.

For example, if you were to bet on LeBron James scoring over 15.5 points in a contest at -125 odds, you’d need to wager $125 to win $100. If you did and your bet was correct, then you’d take home $225, which is your original $125 stake returned to you plus your $100 in profit.

Positive numbers, like +145, show how much you stand to win for every $100 you wager. If you were to bet $50 on Giannis Antetokounmpo to have over 7.5 rebounds and the odds were +130 at the time you finalized your bet slip, you would win $65 in profit if your bet wins.

Positive numbers also indicate which side of the bet is the underdog in the eyes of the oddsmakers.

Remember that you can bet as little or as much as you want, and your payout will be calculated based on your wager amount and the odds at the time you make your bet.

Types of NBA props

You can make two main prop bets on the National Basketball Association:

Team props

Player props

Team props are typically focused on statistical accomplishments by a particular team and rarely on the game’s result. You’ll often come across NBA team prop bets that are based on a team’s points, such as the first team to reach 20 points, the first team to score in a game, or whether the total points by both teams in a contest will end up being odd or even.

Team props, also known as “game props,” don’t rely on individual players but rather on the team as a whole. Player props, on the other hand, are driven by individual performance.

These individual props are focused on statistical milestones during a game. The most popular bets typically focus on points, rebounds, assists, and three-point field goals. You can also bet on combination wagers, such as points and rebounds together.

In most cases, you can bet on traditional statistics for the five starters on each team.

Tips for betting on NBA props

Every bettor should develop their strategies, but we do have three tips you can use for NBA props.

Pay attention to player and team news: Oddsmakers use various information to develop their lines for games and players, and you should, too. Keep tabs on player news and injuries, when top players are being rested, how they performed in recent games, and more. You can find value in player and team props by gathering information from multiple sources and tracking how players and their teammates perform. For example, if one of the starting guards is questionable for a game, you might want to consider the other guard for increased points or assists since they’ll likely handle a heavier load.

Keep an eye on usage and minutes: Even slight increases to a player’s average minutes can make a difference when betting player props, especially later in the season when aging veteran players tend to rest more. Keep yourself informed on usage and minutes trends for the players you’re considering betting on, and use them to your advantage. Remember that some of the best players in the NBA were once on the bench for most games until small increases in their playing time gave them a chance to shine.

Shop for the best lines: This tip applies to every bet you make. Using multiple sportsbook accounts lets you find the best odds for every NBA prop bet. Even the smallest differences, like one sportsbook having odds at +125 and another at +135, can make a difference in your profit. By shopping for the best lines, you can make smarter bets and find the best value.

sports,Jacob Camenker,2023-10-31T22:22:43+00:00,"The 49ers made the biggest move ahead of the 2022 NFL trade deadline when they acquired running back Christian McCaffrey from the Panthers. They once again made a splash ahead of the 2023 trade deadline when they traded for Commanders pass rusher Chase Young.

Young was among the most notable players dealt ahead of the 2023 trade deadline. The No. 2 pick in the 2020 NFL Draft is in the midst of a breakout season, totaling five sacks in eight games and generating a solid 18 pressures while getting into the backfield often for the Commanders.

But as Washington jettisoned its top two defensive ends, Young and Montez Sweat, the 49ers found themselves positioned to pounce. They traded a 2024 third-round pick to get the talented defender and reunite him with his college teammate and fellow No. 2 pick, Nick Bosa.

Young should provide a boost to a 49ers defense that ranks just 22nd this season in sacks per game at 2.3. But many are wondering whether Young will end up being a rental for the 49ers or more of a long-term investment.

That will all depend on how San Francisco manages its salary cap in 2024.

MORE DEADLINE: Live tracker | Grading every trade

On the surface, it may look hard for the 49ers to re-sign Young long-term; in reality, the team has more flexibility to do so than it would initially appear. Here's why.

49ers cap space 2024

As it stands, the 49ers don't project to have much cap space in 2024. In fact, OverTheCap lists San Francisco as having just $1,479,772 in available space. That is good for the seventh-least in the NFL.

That said, the 49ers are equipped to increase their cap space with relative ease. How? Well, they have at least one player on their roster, Randy Gregory, who has an eight-digit salary but doesn't have any guaranteed money left on his deal. That means that the 49ers could release him without taking a dead-cap hit, which is a financial term for when a player no longer on the roster is still owed guaranteed money; that would open up $14 million more in cap space.

Elsewhere, the team has 10 other players on the active roster set to have cap hits of at least $14.1 million who could restructure or extend their contracts.

When NFL teams restructure contracts, they typically take a player's base salary — which is accounted for in a one-year duration — and turn it into some sort of signing bonus. That bonus is allowed to be prorated over the duration of the contract, so it spreads what would be a high, one-year cost out into a moderate cost over several years.

Typically, players who have their contracts restructured have high cap hits and high base salaries. So, in looking at the 49ers' highest-paid players for 2024, there are a few options for restructures, as you can see below.

Player 2024 cap hit Base salary Dead cap hit Trent Williams $31.7 million $20.1 million $29.9 million Arik Armstead $28.6 million $17.4 million $25.9 million Deebo Samuel $28.6 million $21 million $26.5 million Fred Warner $24.5 million $15.3 million $25.6 million George Kittle $22 million $13.4 million $18.9 million Charvarius Ward $17.9 million $12.6 million $17.2 million Javon Hargrave $15.5 million $8.9 million $33.4 million Nick Bosa $14.6 million $1.1 million $76.5 million Brandon Aiyuk $14.1 million $14.1 million $14.1 million Christian McCaffrey $14.1 million $11.8 million $8.6 million

So, if any of Williams, Armstead, Samuel, Kittle or Warner were to restructure their contracts or if a player like Aiyuk got an extension, that would push some of the 49ers' cap hits into future years. That could prove a worthwhile move if it allows for the team to keep Young and keep its Super Bowl window open with the ultra-cheap Brock Purdy at quarterback.

Of course, the team could also release some of its players, like Gregory, to open up space. It doesn't seem likely that any of the players listed above would be cut or traded as all are owed hefty guarantees and come with big dead-cap hits; but the 49ers could trim from the margins of the roster if they need just a bit more cap space to keep Young around.

But a restructuring of contracts will almost certainly happen in San Francisco during the offseason; it's just a matter of which and how many players will get that treatment and whether those funds will be allocated to Young or other portions of the roster.

IYER: Grading the Chase Young to the 49ers trade

Chase Young contract projection

Assessing how San Francisco can try to keep Young also includes looking at what Young's value might be on the open market. It's likely that the 24-year-old will get a large payday as a free agent, but it's just a matter of how big it will be.

Spotrac.com projects that Young should make about $17.8 million annually on a four-year deal. However, that seems a bit light considering that it includes a couple of interior defensive linemen — Dre'Mont Jones and Zach Allen — among his closest comparisons.

It seems more likely that Young will be paid to his potential as well, considering that he missed a lot of time in Years 2 and 3 with injuries. Thus, he may end up being highly paid in terms of average annual value (AAV) but he may see lower-end guarantees.

At the end of the day, however, the deal that seems most likely to suit him is one similar to the extension that the Packers gave Rashan Gary.

Gary is set to have an AAV of $24 million over the duration of that contract while making $96 million over four years. However, only $34.6 million of that deal is guaranteed, as Gary was inconsistent to start his career and dealt with a torn ACL in 2022.

Rashan Gary contract value

Length 4 years Total value $96 million AAV $24 million Guarantees $34.6 million

Young could hypothetically crack $100 million if he's allowed to hit the open market, but the Gary deal projection seems like a sensible ballpark for now.

Of course, the 49ers could also try to slap him with the franchise tag if they're worried about paying him and Bosa big bucks long-term. That was worth just under $20 million last season, so that may look like San Francisco's best avenue toward keeping its Super Bowl window ajar.

However, one-year deals are often complicated to fit into smaller amounts of salary cap space, so the 49ers would likely prefer to get a long-term agreement in place with Young to keep him. At the end of the day, franchising him may not be worth the hassle — even if he is easily the team's best free agent in 2024.

49ers free agents 2024

Young's quest to earn a deal with the 49ers could be aided by the fact that they don't have many key players set to be free agents in 2024.

As it stands, only 15 other 49ers are set to be free agents in 2024. Just two of them, Tashaun Gipson and Clelin Ferrell, are full-time starters; and Young eventually figures to take over as starter for Ferrell.

Below is the full list of 49ers free agents for the 2024 offseason.

Brandon Allen, QB

Oren Burks, LB

Sam Darnold, QB

Ross Dwelley, TE

Jon Feliciano, C

Clelin Ferrell, EDGE

Demetrius Flanagan-Fowles, LB

Tashaun Gipson, S

Kevin Givens, DT

Jauan Jennings, WR

Javon Kinlaw, DT

Ray-Ray McCloud, WR

Terrance Mitchell, CB

Matt Pryor, OT

Charlie Woerner, TE

Chase Young, EDGE

So, while the 49ers will have some key role players like Sam Darnold, Jauan Jennings and Oren Burks set to get new deals, the team's free-agent class is short on high-end talent. That will make it easier for them to focus on keeping Young if they so desire.

As such, fans should view his acquisition as more of an audition to remain with the 49ers than a pure rental.",49ers cap space 2024: Why Chase Young trade may not be a pure rental for San Francisco,https://www.sportingnews.com/us/nfl/news/49ers-cap-space-2024-chase-young-trade/924c310ff72c00dd54a9cf2c,Sporting News
sports,The New York Times,2023-11-03T22:07:31+00:00,"For the past two weeks, coaches across college football have been riveted by the alleged Michigan sign-stealing scheme, but inside the Big Ten, the topic has been more than just a curiosity. On Wednesday’s Big Ten coaches video call with commissioner Tony Petitti, and after Jim Harbaugh left the call, that frustration was voiced loud and clear, according to conference coaches, who said they don’t feel like the new Big Ten commissioner is “motivated” to do anything about the Wolverines.

“There is just a ton of frustration,” a Big Ten coach told The Athletic on Thursday morning. “Look at Jim Harbaugh’s record before this started. The guy was on the hot seat before 2021, and now he’s like the king of college football. … No doubt this all has had a profound effect.

“This guy’s being investigated for three different things now between the (alleged) illegal signal stealing, the (alleged) illegal recruiting during COVID and that investigation into the offensive coordinator and alleged computer hacking. There are guys (on that call) who could lose jobs, and then there’s this guy over here (Harbaugh) who is gonna get a new, bigger contract now, and they won’t do anything about him.”

Asked to describe the tone of the coaches’ sentiment expressed to Petitti, another Big Ten coach called it “angry” — particularly at the Big Ten’s lack of action, or even apparent interest in taking any.

“Everybody’s upset,” that coach told The Athletic. “Why is nothing being done? We want to know, what else do you need to know to take action? We (the Big Ten head coaches) want something done now. I don’t think people understand the advantage that what they’re (allegedly) doing gives you. People think, ‘OK, now that everybody knows, we all can just move on.’ Like, ‘now, it’s fair.’ Well, no, it isn’t. Not at all. This changes the way you operate. A lot of teams have been doing things a certain way for years. Now, it’s forcing you to teach your players a whole new way to communicate just for them. People think that this is just advanced scouting. This was damn near espionage.”

A third Big Ten head coach told The Athletic that this is “one of the most egregious breaches in the spirit of the game” he’s ever heard of.

“They (Michigan) have been manipulating the game and cheating the game for two-and-a-half years. To know exactly what the other team is doing, Michigan might as well have been playing with 15 guys on the field,” he said. “What’s the message the Big Ten is sending now by doing nothing? Win now, pay later? We might as well just send people to (scout) their practices and their games. It doesn’t encourage anybody to follow the rules. It’s just telling them to do the opposite and say, f— it.”

GO DEEPER Michigan should be punished, say 94% of CFB coaches in our poll. What else did it reveal?

The NCAA is investigating Michigan’s football program amid allegations that the Wolverines used illegal in-person scouting and the recording of signals to steal signs this season. Ahead of the Michigan-Michigan State game on Oct. 21, the Big Ten approached MSU and said it was made aware of “credible evidence” regarding the sign-stealing allegations. The Big Ten said it would monitor the NCAA’s investigation into Michigan.

“The Big Ten is so much more powerful than the NCAA,” that third Big Ten coach said. “Why are you just sitting back and doing nothing about this? The Big Ten can’t pound its chest for the last 30 years about how it does the right thing ethically (when other conferences like the SEC won’t) and then have this go on. If this were a team in the bottom half of the Big Ten, would this be handled in the same way?

“When a running back gets hurt against Michigan because they knew exactly what play was coming, will that kid and his family have the ability to sue the Big Ten?”

The NCAA investigation is ongoing, a process that typically moves slowly, which makes it difficult to imagine it will reach a resolution by the time the postseason begins. The Big Ten does have the ability to act under its sportsmanship policy, but that doesn’t mean that it would want to act quickly or decisively before the NCAA completes its entire investigation and allows Michigan a chance to respond to its findings.

This is an unprecedented situation; whatever Petitti decides to do (or not do) will set a precedent. The Big Ten itself doesn’t have investigators, so it needs to rely upon the NCAA to do that part — and to determine who else was involved in the alleged scouting scheme. It’s not clear exactly what the coaches would want the league to do to punish Michigan; banning the team from competing in the Big Ten championship, for example, would harm players who had nothing to do with the sign-stealing apparatus.

A source briefed on the coaches’ call said Big Ten coaches are concerned about whether Michigan “should represent the Big Ten.”

“No matter what happens, if Michigan continues to move forward, the clouds will follow,” the source said. “They’re reading the tea leaves and wondering why the Big Ten hasn’t done anything yet. Every week and every day that goes by, people are like, ‘Something’s gotta give.’ It’s getting a little bit out of hand when you see him (allegedly) on the Central Michigan sideline. The playing field is not level right now. How can you have a team that you know has a competitive advantage over you still being allowed to play? That’s what the coaches are grappling with.”

“It feels like (former commissioner) Kevin (Warren) taking over and then COVID,” the source continued. “Tony’s walking into this situation, and people are calling for the league to make a statement before they have all the facts.”

Despite frustration from all corners of the conference, sources at four different Big Ten schools said they do not expect the conference to levy any sort of punishment against Michigan before the season ends.

Earlier this week, Central Michigan said it is investigating whether suspended Michigan staffer Connor Stalions was on the CMU sideline during the Chippewas’ Sept. 1 game at Michigan State. Screenshots of a person who looks similar to Stalions began circulating online Monday night, and The Athletic obtained more photos of the person on the sideline Tuesday.

AD Amy Folan: “We became aware of these photos late yesterday and we are in the process of determining the facts surrounding them."" pic.twitter.com/ncazAghBbS — Chris Vannini (@ChrisVannini) October 31, 2023

Stalions, who was suspended with pay by Michigan on Oct. 20, is at the center of the NCAA’s investigation into the alleged scouting and sign-stealing scheme. Stalions bought tickets to games in at least seven Big Ten stadiums before those teams played the Wolverines over the past three seasons, including the 2023 season, sources told The Athletic last month. Purchasing the tickets is not a violation of NCAA rules, but using them to scout and record other teams would violate the rules, prohibiting in-person, on-campus scouting and the audio or video recording of signals.

“They aren’t allegations. It happened,” Purdue coach Ryan Walters said Thursday night on his radio show ahead of Saturday’s game against the Wolverines. “There’s video evidence. There’s ticket purchases and sales you can track back. We know for a fact they were at a number of our games. We’ve had to teach our guys a new language.”

On Monday, coach Jim Harbaugh met with reporters and said “the people that know us the most think the most of us” as Michigan faces the NCAA investigation. He has denied knowledge of the alleged scouting.

sports,Hunter Felt,2023-10-28T23:00:28+00:00,"29 Oct 2023 03.21 GMT Final thoughts Okay, we officially have a series! Assuming one has no rooting interest in either of the remaining teams, there’s no greater start to a World Series than a split in the first two games. A 1-1 split is an ideal situation for the casual fan as it usually portends a longer series. It is, of course, a less than ideal situation for the Rangers. Today, their weaknesses were exposed and they know their two-game home stand could have gone worse: they needed plenty of late-inning drama just to pull off a come-from-behind win in Game 1. What happens next is anybody’s guess. The World Series heads to Arizona for Monday’s Game 3 where Rangers’ Max Scherzer and the Diamondbacks’ Brandon Pfaadt are currently penciled in as the probable starters. Stay tuned to the Guardian for further coverage of the 2023 World Series as it develops but this will wrap up today’s Game 2 liveblog. Thanks to everybody who followed along with us tonight. Ciao!



29 Oct 2023 03.12 GMT Merrill Kelly Despite the final score, this was a much closer game until the Rangers bullpen imploded late. Arizona’s big hero was starting pitcher Merrill Kelly who put up a dazzling pitching performance: 7.0 IP, 3 H, 1 ER, 7 Ks. It even felt like he could have stayed in there longer if necessary. Easily the player of the game.



29 Oct 2023 03.08 GMT The Arizona Diamondbacks win Game 2 The Arizona Diamondbacks, on the back of an impressive pitching performance by Merrill Kelly, have won Game 2 of the 2023 World Series! The series is now tied 1-1 heading to Arizona for Monday’s Game 3.

Updated at 03.10 GMT

29 Oct 2023 03.07 GMT Diamondbacks 9-1 Rangers, FINAL Garver’s only goal here is to not make the final out of a World Series game. Luckily for him, Frías puts him in a decent position by throwing him two straight balls to start the plate appearance. However, after two strikes, he lines out to third and, in fact, makes the final out of a World Series game. The Arizona Diamondbacks hold on to win!



29 Oct 2023 03.04 GMT Diamondbacks 9-1 Rangers, bottom 9th Frías can end the game right here, as long as he can get García out. He falls behind 2-1, which would be worrisome if he wasn’t working with an eight-run lead. Semien takes second on defensive indifference but he would have made it there anyways because García eventually takes ball four. There’s runners on first and second but the key stat remains the fact that there’s two outs in the ninth inning.



29 Oct 2023 03.01 GMT Diamondbacks 9-1 Rangers, bottom 9th Grossman looks at a Frías ball to start his at-bat but three strikes later, he’s out of there. The Rangers are down to their final out.



29 Oct 2023 02.58 GMT Diamondbacks 9-1 Rangers, bottom 9th Luis Frías is coming into the game to get the final two outs for Arizona, possibly against Rangers pinch-hitter Robbie Grossman. Stay tuned.

Updated at 03.00 GMT

29 Oct 2023 02.57 GMT Diamondbacks 9-1 Rangers, bottom 9th Seager is up next. He hits a long flyball that’s caught in centerfield. The Rangers are down to their last two outs of Game 2.



29 Oct 2023 02.56 GMT Diamondbacks 9-1 Rangers, bottom 9th Saalfrank starts the bottom of the ninth, hoping to end this one as quickly as possible. Semien will lead things off here, although one imagines the Rangers are already looking ahead to Game 3. Semien hits a booming flyball that lands foul. He takes a ball and then fouls off the next pitch. 1-2. He then hits a ground ball that sneaks through the defenders for a single, his first hit of the game.



29 Oct 2023 02.52 GMT Two run single! (Rivera) Diamondbacks 9-1 Rangers Diamondbacks 9-1 Rangers, top 9th Rivera is up with runners on second and third but two outs. He drives in two runs with a single to absolutely ruin my pregame prediction. He gets thrown out on second to end the inning however. To the bottom of the ninth!



29 Oct 2023 02.50 GMT Diamondbacks 7-1 Rangers, top 9th Thomas is up with two on and one out. He grounds out on two pitches, moving the runners into scoring position.



29 Oct 2023 02.49 GMT Diamondbacks 7-1 Rangers, top 9th Gurriel hits a single to centerfield, Peterson advances on the play.



29 Oct 2023 02.48 GMT Diamondbacks 7-1 Rangers, top 9th Jace Peterson is getting a pinch-hitting opportunity here for Arizona. It’s kind of like a basketball game now here where the coaches empty out the bench. Peterson works a full count before hitting into a fielder’s choice. Walker is erased on the play. So it’s one down with Peterson on first.



29 Oct 2023 02.45 GMT Diamondbacks 7-1 Rangers, top 9th Pérez is back out there to pitch, essentially in mop-up duty now. He faces Walker, who hits a single to center. That’s Walker’s first hit of the World Series so good for him.



29 Oct 2023 02.41 GMT Diamondbacks 7-1 Rangers, bottom 8th That’s two quick outs for the Diamondbacks, so Tavares is up to try to salvage anything here for Texas. He falls behind in the count 0-2, takes two pitches and grounds out to short. The Rangers challenge the play, but the call is confirmed. To the ninth inning!



29 Oct 2023 02.38 GMT Diamondbacks 7-1 Rangers, bottom 8th Saalfrank gets Jung to ground out to third, sorry Jung lovers.



29 Oct 2023 02.37 GMT Diamondbacks 7-1 Rangers, bottom 8th Andrew Saalfrank is pitching now for Arizona as Kelly gets a well-earned rest. Rivera stays in the game, playing third base. Lowe is at the plate for the Rangers and he promptly grounds out to second.



29 Oct 2023 02.36 GMT Me earlier: “I’m going to guess this ends with a score like Diamondbacks 6-2 Rangers.” If this holds up, I want to claim partial credit.



29 Oct 2023 02.34 GMT Diamondbacks 7-1 Rangers, top 8th Moreno strikes out on three pitches to finally end the inning, but the damage is done and this one feels all but out of reach for Texas. Still, the game must go on and we head to the bottom of the 8th inning.



29 Oct 2023 02.33 GMT RBI single! (Carroll) Diamondbacks 7-1 Rangers Diamondbacks 7-1 Rangers, top 8th Carroll singles here and scores Perdomo! The Diamondbacks are just teeing off on these relievers.



29 Oct 2023 02.31 GMT Two-run single! (Marte) Diamondbacks 6-1 Rangers Diamondbacks 6-1 Rangers, top 8th This is more like the Rangers bullpen I was expecting. Ketel Marte is up next with the bases loaded and a chance to make the rest of this game entirely irrelevant. Pérez’s first pitch is yet another ball, this one that barely misses the ground. 1-0. Marte takes a huge swing and the next pitch, he doesn’t make contact. However, on the next pitch, he knocks in a base hit that’s a two-run, two-out single and the Diamondbacks have a five-run lead!



29 Oct 2023 02.28 GMT Diamondbacks 4-1 Rangers, top 8th Pérez faces Perdomo who looks at two straight strikes. He fouls off a 0-2 pitch to stay alive before taking a ball. 1-2. He doesn’t offer at another ball. 2-2. Pérez tries a sinker and doesn’t get the call. 3-2. The crowd boos, it does look like a borderline pitch but Pérez isn’t really showing great command. And, yeah, he throws another ball to walk the bases loaded.



29 Oct 2023 02.25 GMT Diamondbacks 4-1 Rangers, top 8th What if you appeared in a World Series game and didn’t get a chance to hit? Well, it looks like Emmanuel Rivera is in to hit with Pérez in the game. Ah, managerial chess matches, how I loathe thee. Once again, that runner is still on second and there are still two outs. Pérez gets a strike on his first pitch to Rivera and then uncorks three straight pitches that aren’t in the zone before Rivera swings and misses to make it a full count. He waits for the next pitch and takes a walk. So that’s runners on first and second with two outs now.



29 Oct 2023 02.21 GMT Diamondbacks 4-1 Rangers, top 8th Oh hey, a rare Diamondbacks pinch-hitter. Welcome to the World Series, Pavin Smith! Meanwhile, Stratton is out of the game now and pitcher Martín Pérez is coming in.



29 Oct 2023 02.20 GMT Diamondbacks 4-1 Rangers, top 8th To be fair, that’s not a terrible bunt, again it’s a situation where one more run might put this one out of reach. It’s also weird because Stratton doesn’t seem sharp. He gets ahead of Thomas 0-2 and just can’t put him away. Thomas works a full count and then starts to foul off fastballs to stay alive. On pitch number nine, however, Stratton gets him to look at a curve that just hits the corner for strike three. That’s now two out with a runner on second. The announcers note that this was the first time an Arizona hitter struck out this game, which is maybe the number one reason why the Diamondbacks are in front.



29 Oct 2023 02.16 GMT Diamondbacks 4-1 Rangers, top 8th Gurriel Jr. is up next. He bunts and I’m just getting sick of this. Pham is on second base with one out now.



29 Oct 2023 02.15 GMT Diamondbacks 4-1 Rangers, top 8th Chris Stratton is the next Rangers reliever. He has absolutely no room for error given that there’s a huge difference between a three-run deficit and a four-run deficit. It’s the entire basis of the archaic “save” rule! He’s here to face Pham, who puts him to work by running up a full count on eight pitches before hitting a single to start of the top of the eighth. He’s 4-to-4 on the day.



29 Oct 2023 02.10 GMT In a world full of bullpen games and pitching “openers,” it’s important that we recognize how rare it is for a starter to get this deep in a postseason game. Merrill Kelly is now the first pitcher to work seven innings in a World Series game in the 2020s. The last pitchers to do it were Stephen Strasburg (8.1 IP) and Gerrit Cole (7 innings twice) in 2019. — Tyler Kepner (@TylerKepner) October 29, 2023



29 Oct 2023 02.09 GMT Diamondbacks 4-1 Rangers, bottom 7th Two out, nobody on in the bottom of the seventh. Heim is up to the plate for Texas and he gets ahead of the count 2-0 before looking at his first strike. 2-1. Kelly’s next pitch is a ball, 3-1. Could this be a rare walk? Nope, Heim watches two straight strikes to end the inning. The Rangers have just six outs to play with to score three runs. Can they pull of late-inning magic again?

sports,Yardbarker,2023-11-09T21:51:02+00:00,"Of the 16 AFC team MVPs at the season's midpoint, five are quarterbacks. At least two of them should be in the running for league MVP after the season. Meanwhile, a wideout who might be on his way to the greatest individual season at the position is his team's MVP through nine games. Here are Yardbarker's team-by-team MVPs. (Find Yardbarker's NFC team MVPs here.)

AFC East

BUFFALO BILLS | QB Josh Allen: Allen probably won't finish in the top three of NFL MVP balloting as he did last season, but his value to the Bills is immeasurable. Through nine games, he is on pace to set a career-high in completion rate (71.3%) and tops all QBs in QBR (75.3). Allen has virtually carried the offense by himself, accounting for 24 of the team's 28 offensive touchdowns.

MIAMI DOLPHINS | WR Tyreek Hill: Arguably the best wide receiver in the NFL, Hill has somehow reached a new level of dominance in his age-29 season. The seven-time Pro Bowler leads the NFL in receiving yards (1,076) and TD catches (eight). As long as the Dolphins maintain their success on offense down the stretch, Hill should earn Offensive Player of the Year honors. He's on pace to break Calvin Johnson's season record for receiving yards (1,964).



NEW YORK JETS | LB Quincy Williams: While his brother, Quinnen, may be the better-known Jets defender in the family, Williams — the AFC Defensive Player of the Month for October — is also making a name for himself. Aside from being the fifth-highest-rated linebacker in the NFL by Pro Football Focus, Williams is tied for 17th in tackles (74) and tied for ninth in TFLs (nine) among all defenders.

NEW ENGLAND PATRIOTS | S Jabrill Peppers: There hasn't been much to get excited about in New England, but the versatile defensive back is a bright spot and a respected voice in the locker room. Peppers has 54 tackles — three for loss — one interception, one forced fumble and a team-leading six passes defended. For a team facing as many uncertainties as the Patriots are, Peppers is a solid piece to build around in the short term. — Colum Dell

AFC West

DENVER BRONCOS | CB Patrick Surtain II: In eight games, the 23-year-old budding star has one interception and eight passes defended, tied for 11th in the NFL. Don’t be surprised if he earns a second straight Pro Bowl nod.

KANSAS CITY CHIEFS | QB Patrick Mahomes: A shaky receiving corps hasn’t fazed Mahomes. He’s third in the NFL in passing yards (2,442), fourth in TD passes (17) and third in QBR (73). The 28-year-old might capture his third MVP, as oddschecker notes he’s favored to win the award again.

LAS VEGAS RAIDERS | Defensive end Maxx Crosby: Despite a weak supporting cast, Crosby thrives. He has 9.5 of the Raiders’ 24 sacks and is tied for the league lead in tackles for loss (13). If the two-time Pro Bowler keeps dominating, he will generate more Defensive Player of the Year buzz.

LOS ANGELES CHARGERS | WR Keenan Allen: The 31-year-old is the centerpiece of the offense and leads the team in yards receiving (720) and receptions (62). Through Week 9, Pro Football Focus gave him a receiving grade of 84.6, eighth among WRs. — Clark Dalton

AFC North

BALTIMORE RAVENS | QB Lamar Jackson: Jackson has inserted himself into the league MVP conversation during his team’s four-game win streak. The 2019 NFL MVP has thrown for 1,954 yards and nine touchdowns and posted 440 yards and five touchdowns rushing. He is the reason, once again, Baltimore is a Super Bowl contender.

CLEVELAND BROWNS | Defensive end Myles Garrett: Garrett could be leading the race for the Defensive Player of the Year. The No. 1 overall pick in 2017 is tied for the second-most sacks (9.5) and most forced fumbles (four) in the league. He also blocked a field-goal attempt in a Week 7 win over the Colts. He's the ringleader of a defense that allows the fewest yards per game (234.8).

CINCINNATI BENGALS | QB Joe Burrow: Battling a calf injury, Burrow had a rough start to the season. He appears fully recovered now, though, as the Bengals (5-3) have won four straight. During their win streak, Burrow has thrown for 1,133 yards, 10 touchdowns and just two interceptions.

PITTSBURGH STEELERS | Linebacker T.J. Watt: The Steelers are the first team in NFL history to be outgained by their opponents in each of their first eight games and have a winning record (5-3). It hasn’t been pretty to watch, but Pittsburgh always makes plays when needed. The player who seems to make the most is Watt. The 2021 NFL Defensive Player of the Year is tied for second-most sacks (9.5) in the league. He also has two forced fumbles, three fumble recoveries and one interception. — Aaron Becker

AFC South

HOUSTON TEXANS | QB C.J. Stroud: Stroud is having one of the best statistical rookie seasons of all time. He ranks in the top 10 in passing yards (2,270), touchdown passes (14) and passer rating (102.9), and has only thrown one interception. The Texans (4-4) aren’t close to a .500 team without him.

INDIANAPOLIS COLTS | RB Zack Moss: With Jonathan Taylor missing the first four weeks of the season, Moss stepped up in a big way. After not playing in Week 1, he rushed for 445 yards and scored four touchdowns over his next four games to help Indy win three of four and stay in the thick of the AFC South. Moss is second in the NFL in rushing, 37 yards behind San Francisco's Christian McCaffrey.

JACKSONVILLE JAGUARS | RB Travis Etienne: QB Trevor Lawrence hasn’t quite taken the step forward everyone thought he would, but fortunately for the Jags, Etienne is emerging as one of the top RBs in the league. He has rushed for multiple touchdowns in three of his past four games and scored a touchdown in five of the team’s six wins. Etienne ranks third the NFL in rushing touchdowns (seven) and sixth in rushing yards (583).

TENNESSEE TITANS | DT Jeffery Simmons: There haven’t been too many bright spots for the Titans, but Simmons continues to be a wrecking ball on the defensive line. He leads the team in tackles for loss (six) and ranks second in sacks (4.5). If not for Simmons, Tennessee’s defense would rank a heck of a lot lower than 20th in yards allowed per game (337.8). — Michael Gallagher",MVPs for all 16 AFC teams at the midpoint,https://www.yardbarker.com/nfl/articles/mvps_for_all_16_afc_teams_at_the_midpoint/s1_13132_39511866,Yardbarker
sports,"Wes Goldberg, RealGM",2023-11-29T20:41:32+00:00,"In June of 2021, Jonathan Kuminga and Moses Moody sat on a stage on the Chase Center court, with then-GM Bob Myers to their left, as the Warriors introduced their newest first-round draft picks.

“We’re excited,” Myers said. “I talk about the character first because that’s what’s going to make that A-grade stick or not. It’s gonna be on what they do from here on out, not what they've done so far.”

It’s true that the Warriors received glowing grades from draft analysts following their selections of Kuminga, out of the G-League Ignite program, at No. 7, and Arkansas’ Moody at No. 14. Unfortunately for them, that A-grade has not stuck.

Fast-forward more than two years and both players are struggling to make the sort of impact the Warriors had hoped when they flaunted their two-timeline plan. Kuminga, though he’s had flashes and is only 21, is almost as raw as he was as an 18-year-old. He plays nearly 20 minutes per game for a thin Warriors team, but his shooting percentages (43.8% overall, 19.4% on 3s) have dipped to career lows. Moody has been the more stable of the two. He’s a reliable catch-and-shoot threat (38.2% shooting from 3) and earnest defender but doesn’t do much outside the limits of his job description.

The Warriors are 8-10 following Tuesday’s disastrous collapse to the Kings in Sacramento. Leading by five with 58 seconds to go and a spot in the next round of the In-Season Tournament on the line, Andrew Wiggins fouled De’Aaron Fox, Stephen Curry passed the ball straight to Malik Monk on his own side of the court, Draymond Green threw the ball out of bounds and Monk scored five points in the final 37 seconds to send the Warriors back to San Francisco forced to ask some tough questions.

On the floor for these minutes were Curry, Klay Thompson, Green, Wiggins and Kevon Looney. Four of the five were drafted by the Warriors. Steph, Klay and Draymond are the bedrock of four championship teams and perhaps the NBA’s greatest dynasty this century.

But a franchise built through the draft has had very little success selecting players over the past decade.

If the Warriors seem old, it’s because they are. Curry (35) can still play at an MVP level, but Green (33) and Thompson (33) are not the players they were during Golden State’s run to five straight Finals.

Green (when he isn’t suspended) can still uncork vintage defensive performances, but his offensive game has not aged well as the league trends toward more shooting. The typically affable Thompson, having suffered two major leg injuries since 2019, is bristling at questions about the starting lineup. The Warriors’ starting five – a dominant unit over the last decade – is being outscored by an alarming 10.6 points every 100 possessions this season.

The Warriors have had a hard time reinventing themselves. The two-timeline approach was supposed to infuse the team with youth and athleticism. Instead, Kuminga and Moody can’t crack the rotation some nights, and 2020’s No. 2 overall pick James Wiseman now plays in Detroit.

If anything, the Warriors got older. Over the last nine months, they traded 24-year-old Jordan Poole to the Wizards in a deal that netted 38-year-old Chris Paul, unloaded Wiseman to bring back 30-year-old Gary Payton II and signed 29-year-old Dario Saric to help anchor the second unit. Behind the Bucks and Clippers, the Warriors are the league’s third-oldest team.

It’s easy to point to the 2020 and 2021 drafts as the problem. The Warriors – during a two-year, injury-riddled drought that separated Finals runs – in 2021 selected Kuminga one pick ahead of Franz Wagner and Moody over Alperen Sengun and Trey Murphy III. The year before, they drafted Wiseman over LaMelo Ball and Tyrese Haliburton.

(At the risk of saying I told you so, a certain Warriors beat reporter at the time argued for the better picks here and here. There was something to be said of drafting the more NBA-ready players, even at the risk of missing out on Wiseman’s and Kuminga’s ceilings.)

But Golden State’s original sins run deeper than that. Here’s a look at their recent draft history.

Looney, picked in 2015 (when “Uptown Funk” and “Trap Queen” were topping music charts) is the only indisputable success. Beyond that, Poole is the only other draft pick to have signed another contract with the Warriors beyond his rookie deal.

Poole, at 28, helped power the Warriors to the 2022 championship but was in equal amounts part of the problem the next season. (And based on his season in Washington, his 2022 playoff run is looking more and more like an outlier.)

Four draft picks are now on other teams: Patrick Baldwin, Wiseman, Poole and Damian Jones; and four are no longer in the league: Nico Mannion, Justinian Jessup, Eric Paschall, Jacob Evans.

June’s 19th overall pick Brandin Podziemski seems like a base hit right now, but it’s been a month. Do I need to remind you of the brief flashes we saw from Paschall?

To be fair, it’s hard to nail the draft when you’re always selecting at 28 and 30. But using three lottery picks and coming away with maybe one fringe rotation player would doom any franchise that doesn’t have Steph Curry.

For years, these picks and players have been a luxury for the Warriors, but the age problem is coming to a head. Thompson will be a free agent in seven months, Paul’s contract for next season is not guaranteed and Green’s new contract, though a bargain now, might not look as great when he’s 37 years old.

Maximizing what’s left of Curry’s championship window will prompt some tough decisions. The Warriors might have to cut bait on the two remaining lottery picks who shared a stage two years ago, Kuminga and Moody. Either one could have value as a “second draft” candidate for a younger team. For instance, Kuminga’s $6 million salary can be added to Payton to build $14.7 million in outgoing salary. Moody’s $3.9 million is some sugar to sweeten a deal for any of Golden State’s higher-priced players.

Available big names like Zach LaVine might not make a ton of sense given his age and contract, but everything from All-Star acquisitions to trading for helpful role players should be on the table. If the Warriors decide to reorient the roster around Curry between now and February’s trade deadline, new GM Mike Dunleavy Jr. would be tasked with rebuilding a jet mid-flight.

Whether it’s before the trade deadline or next summer, it feels like something is bound to change in Golden State. The draft picks haven’t panned out and Curry’s supporting cast is showing its age, but finding solutions in the middle is easier said than done.",Golden State's draft misses are starting to add up,https://www.yardbarker.com/nba/articles/golden_states_draft_misses_are_starting_to_add_up/s1_8276_39602204,Yardbarker
sports,The New York Times,2023-12-09T22:04:02+00:00,"Shohei Ohtani’s singular pursuit of history, one man’s quest to rewrite the baseball world’s understanding of what is possible, reached another summit on Saturday when he agreed to the largest contract in the annals of major North American team sports, a 10-year, $700 million contract with the Los Angeles Dodgers, his agency CAA announced.

Advertisement

Ohtani announced his decision on Instagram. The deal ends years of feverish speculation about Ohtani’s future. Ohtani, a 29-year-old two-way sensation, has captivated the industry since he left Japan for Major League Baseball heading into the 2018 season. He has done things that appeared impossible in the modern era, feats that harkened back to Babe Ruth. As he traveled the country with the Los Angeles Angels this past summer, fans serenaded him with recruiting pitches. When he entered free agency, a dozen teams lined up, curious to see if they could meet his eye.

Only one team could secure Ohtani’s services. He will now be compensated for both his immense talent and his unparalleled star power. His contract eclipsed the $360 million record for free agents set last winter by New York Yankees slugger Aaron Judge and also surpassed the record-setting $426.5 million extension from Ohtani’s former Angels teammate Mike Trout. His achievement exceeded even those outside of baseball, topping the $450 million contract inked by Kansas City Chiefs quarterback Patrick Mahomes. Ohtani has outpaced even soccer star Lionel Messi’s $674 million contract — signed in 2017 when he was with FC Barcelona.

His individual brilliance was not enough to lift the Angels into the postseason. With the Dodgers, Ohtani will now have an opportunity to add collective hardware to his trophy case. The Dodgers have won the National League West in 10 of the past 11 seasons, topped 100 victories in five of the past six full seasons and won the World Series in 2020. Ohtani has never played a postseason game in his big-league career.

“My sense is that he wants to be the best ever,” said St. Louis Cardinals outfielder Lars Nootbaar, who played with Ohtani last spring in the World Baseball Classic, “but I don’t think he would ever publicly say that.”

Deferrals effectively lower the average annual value of Ohtani’s contract, giving the Dodgers greater flexibility as they attempt to navigate Major League Baseball’s luxury-tax system, which includes penalties for teams that exceed certain thresholds.

A team’s luxury tax-payroll is calculated according to players’ average annual values, and discounted by deferrals. Mookie Betts, for example, has $115 million deferred in his 12-year, $365 million contract with the Dodgers. Under the league’s calculations, the deferrals lower his average annual value from $30.4 million to $25.5 million.

Dodgers officials declined comment when asked if Ohtani had taken a physical, the final step before a deal can become official.

Significant questions linger about Ohtani’s future. He will not pitch in 2024 as he recovers from a September operation to repair his right elbow’s ulnar collateral ligament. He underwent Tommy John surgery in 2018. Neither Ohtani, who has not taken questions from reporters since August, nor his agent, Nez Balelo, nor the Angels have disclosed the exact nature of the second surgery, but the Los Angeles Times has reported it was a second Tommy John procedure.

Balelo has stressed that Ohtani remains committed to both pitching and hitting in the future. “Shohei loves to pitch,” Balelo told reporters in September. Ohtani will attempt to return to the mound in 2025. His camp has not revealed at what point Ohtani would consider giving up his dual career and focusing on learning a different position. Since he was a teenager, Ohtani has ignored suggestions that he focus on only one pursuit.

Ohtani demonstrated his potential as the American League Rookie of the Year in 2018, but his two-way hopes were delayed after his first elbow surgery. It was not until 2021 that the full flower of his ability bloomed. He has won the American League MVP in two of the past three seasons; in the intervening season, he led all American League pitchers in strikeout rate while hitting 34 home runs with an .875 OPS. To create a comparison for him involves inventions that sound freakish. “It’s like if Judge went out and was a 20-game winner as well,” former teammate Kole Calhoun said.

Ohtani is committed to being a starting pitcher. If he cannot stay healthy enough for that role, he could aid his new team as a reliever. He closed the final game of the World Baseball Classic, securing the crown for Japan by striking out Trout. His four-seam fastball averaged nearly 97 mph in 2023; the velocity of the pitch figures to improve in short bursts.

Even if Ohtani never pitches again, his value as a hitter is immense. In 1920, his first season exclusively as a hitter, Ruth led the American League in homers, on-base percentage and slugging percentage. In 2023, while still making 23 starts with a 3.14 ERA, Ohtani led the American League in the same three categories as Ruth. He swatted 44 homers with a career-best 1.066 OPS. He did this while making starts and dealing with a torn ligament in his elbow.

Only one stage remains for Ohtani. He has never played a postseason game in the majors. As the Angels foundered in recent years, Ohtani became more vocal about his desire to play for a winner. Now he has the chance to make a different kind of history.

sports,Kyle Bonn,2023-10-12T23:22:00+00:00,"Argentina completely dominated Paraguay from start to finish, both with and without Lionel Messi, and picked up three points in the process, although it was a bit more nervy than they would have liked at the end.

With Argentina pummeling their CONMEBOL World Cup qualifying opponents in Buenos Aires from the opening whistle, Nicolas Otamendi's fourth-minute goal seemed to foreshadow a coming onslaught. Yet that was all Argentina would get, and while it was enough for a 1-0 victory, they could have had many, many more.

Lionel Messi came off the bench shortly after halftime, but even he was powerless to change the narrative, hitting the post twice including once directly off a corner.

Lautaro Martinez, Rodrigo de Paul, and Nico Gonzalez were all very active in the final third and had multiple chances, but none were able to find the all-important second goal to kill off the match. Yet in the end, Emiliano Martinez had himself another clean sheet as Paraguay failed to produce more than a single quality attacking chance.

The shutout gave Dibu an Argentine national team record, passing 609 minutes without conceding a goal, as Argentina have not been breached since Kylian Mbappe's dramatic 118th minute equalizer in the 2022 World Cup final. Additionally, Lionel Scaloni has still never been beaten in World Cup qualifying as Argentina head coach.

FULLTIME: Argentina 1-0 Paraguay

Argentina are most certainly deserved victors as they walk away with all three points, but they made it harder than it had to be by failing to finish a whole host of great chances. The entire team was impressive until it came time to shoot, and even Lionel Messi couldn't change the narrative as he hit the post twice.

All told thought, Nicolas Otamendi's early goal was enough to see them through to all three points, as they top Paraguay at home and move to nine points from a possible nine to start World Cup qualifying.

Argentina vs Paraguay: Second Half

90+2 min: Chance, Argentina! Argentina have a very dangerous free-kick as Lionel Messi baits Gustavo Gomez into a foul just atop the penalty area in a central location. Gomez does well to dispossess Messi, but the Argentine is first back on the loose ball, expertly shielding the ball with his body, and Gomez obliges by barging in from behind.

With the set-piece, Messi hits the woodwork! Carlos Coronel is helpless to do anything but watch, rooted to the spot, and he sees it sail by him and strike the outside of the left post!

Gio Lo Celso comes on for Argentina to replace Rodrigo de Paul, who had a very good match.

89th min: As this game sputters towards a conclusion, Emiliano Martinez has set a new national team record for a shutout streak, crossing 609 minutes of play without conceding a goal. It's an impressive mark nonetheless, but in fairness, he's had almost nothing to do tonight, making just one (admittedly impressive) save.

Argentina have not conceded a single goal since the 2022 World Cup final. Four minutes of stoppage time are shown.

609 minutes and counting.

86th min: CONTROVERSY! Antonio Sanabria draws the ire of Lionel Messi, which you rarely see. Why? Replay shows it's because Sanabria showered Messi with spit from behind. That's disgusting! The officials missed it, but Messi obviously did not.

84th min: Chance, Argentina! Paraguay fail to clear on a number of occasions, and on recycle, Lautaro Martinez fires just inches over the crossbar! He's in acres of space atop the penalty area shaded just right of the middle, and cutting onto his left, he rifles a shot just high! He should be hitting the target from there with so much space to shoot.

That's the first real chance on goal from open play for either team in some time. The game has been mucked up a bit by the substitutions on both sides.

77th min: Chance, Argentina! LIONEL MESSI HITS THE POST DIRECTLY FROM A CORNER! He floats an in-swinger that sails over a helpless Carlos Coronel and clangs the far top corner of the woodwork! That's so close to an olimpico!

Enzo Fernandez is withdrawn by Argentina in favor of Leandro Paredes.

75th min: With Lionel Messi set to take a corner for Argentina, Junior Alonso is now down needing treatment. At first it seems like a cramp as a teammate stretches out his leg, but he continues to grimace in pain, and after the medical staff tends to the Paraguay defender for a bit, they signal to the bench that a change is required.

Alonso is strapped to a stretcher and continues to grimace in lots of pain. On comes Mathias Villasanti, signaling a potential change of formation.

70th min: Junior Alonso has got to be careful. Already on a yellow card, he fouls Lautaro Martinez hard and gets a talking too from the referee.

Paraguay make their second change of the match, a double swap as Antonio Sanabria and Braian Ojeda come on, replacing Antonio Bareiro and Alvaro Campuzano.

68th min: Rodrigo de Paul forces a save from Carlos Coronel! It's from an extremely tight angle on the right, almost on top of the end line, so Coronel has his post covered well, but it wins a corner. The set-piece is wasted by being played short.

63rd min: It has to be said...Argentina have dropped their level since Lionel Messi has come on. That's not to say its explicitly his fault, but the whole team has been sloppy since he entered the pitch. Paraguay have looked a bit more confident pressing the hosts, and it has caused some problems to them in possession.

57th min: Uh, how has Ramon Sosa got away without a booking here? He barges into Rodrigo de Paul extremely late for no reason, as he arrived well after the ball and threw his body into the Argentine midfielder. The referee has a chat with Sosa, but decides not to book him, somehow.

53rd min: Chance, Paraguay! The best attacking move of the match for the visitors nearly sees Ramon Sosa score a dramatic equalizer, but Emiliano Martinez makes a fingertips save to see the ball deflect just inches wide! It comes on a Route One move deep for Sosa who brings the ball down well and fires a vicious shot.

Lionel Messi enters for Julian Alvarez, and takes the captain's armband from Nicolas Otamendi with a chuckle, as Otamendi puts it on Messi himself despite Messi telling him not to give it up.

It's kind of odd that Lionel Scaloni would turn down the chance to bring Messi on at halftime without burning a substitution window, only to see him enter only eight minutes later, but here we are.

50th min: Antonio Bareiro picks up a hilarious yellow card after a coming together with Cristiano Romero. Bareiro fouls Romero and gets away with it, and Romero reacts later off the ball by bumping the Paraguay forward, who throws himself dramatically to the turf. It's the reaction which earns the booking, while Romero is lucky to get away with his brainless moment.

Kickoff: They've begun the second half, and while Lionel Messi has not entered the pitch yet, he's warming up on the touchline and likely to come on soon. Alexis Mac Allister is fouled from behind just seconds after the restart.

Robert Rojas has come on for Paraguay in the first substitution of the match, entering at right-back for Ivan Ramirez.

HALFTIME: Argentina 1-0 Paraguay

Somehow, some way, Nicolas Otamendi's fourth-minute goal remains the only successful strike of this game so far. Argentina completely and utterly dominated the first 45 minutes, but have precious little to show for it.

The hosts pummeled Carlos Coronel's net, and while the Red Bulls goalkeeper has made a few saves, it's mostly been Argentina's wastefulness that has seen them fail to follow up their early opener. Rodrigo de Paul hit the post, Alexis Mac Allister probably should have had a penalty, and Nico Gonzalez has missed a few great chances from the left.

Overall, Lionel Scaloni will be pleased with his side's performance, but the match hangs in the balance on the scoresheet. In reality, thought, Paraguay need vast improvement if they are to snatch a result after being meticulously carved to pieces.

Argentina vs Paraguay: First Half

45th min: Chance, Argentina! Nico Gonzalez misses! The hosts break down the right, and Enzo Fernandez has acres of space to shoot at the top of the penalty area, but instead squares it left to Nico Gonzalez. The Argentina winger also has tons of room to shoot, but he's at a tight angle, and Carlos Coronel's positioning leaves him with a very small window to aim for.

Needing a precise finish, Gonzalez comes up empty, dragging it wide across the face of goal. It's not far off, but it's missing the required precision! How have Argentina not scored a second????

42nd min: Chance, Argentina! RODRIGO DE PAUL HITS THE POST! It's SO close from the Argentine midfielder, who's been very active in the final third! After cutting onto his left, he brings it back onto his right and unleashes a curler which dances past a diving Carlos Coronel and strikes the inside of the post!

The ball agonizingly careens along the face of goal and skitters away. Just another half-inch more towards the frame and it would have deflected in instead of out!

41st min: Paraguay are getting extremely frustrated with their lack of attacking possession. They get into the final third for the first time in ages, but with no support, Antonio Bareiro blasts a hopeless effort from a long way out, the shot blocked by his defender who's all over the lone Paraguay striker like white on rice.

38th min: Chance, Argentina! A deep delivery from way out on the right touchline meets the head of a leaping Nico Gonzalez at the far post, but it's saved well by Carlos Coronel! The header was from a very tight angle, but the Red Bulls goalkeeper still had work to do as he reacted quickly to stick out his left foot and make the reflex stop.

36th min: Chance, Argentina! The referee very dramatically waves away a penalty shout from Alexis Mac Allister! A corner is cleared to the Liverpool midfielder at the top of the penalty area, and he does brilliantly to dribble through multiple defenders. Before he can get a shot off, he's bumped to the ground, and replay shows he has a clear grievance with the no-call! VAR does not intervene.

ALEXIS MAC ALLISTER, STOP THAT.pic.twitter.com/wlShqa6mqR — Roy Nemer (@RoyNemer) October 12, 2023

34th min: Alvaro Campuzano is whistled for a foul after hip checking Nicolas Tagliafico to the ground, handing Argentina a dangerous free-kick just inside the attacking third. The call by the official sends both Campuzano and Paraguay manager Daniel Garnero into a frenzy, as neither agree with the decision, but it's the right call for overly aggressive body positioning.

The chance is wasted, however, as it is easily cleared and Argentina must reset.

30th min: Chance, Argentina! Lautaro Martinez has a vicious shot agonizingly deflected wide! He's played in on a cutback from Julian Alvarez down the right, and while the Inter striker has a quality hit from the penalty spot, it just clips a defender and loops inches over the crossbar! That's unlucky!

Argentina are absolutely pummeling the Paraguay back line with silky move after silky move, and the visitors are barely surviving. It's been an onslaught through the first half-hour, especially across the last 10 minutes or so. The one-touch passing through midfield has been essentially unplayable, and on the rare occasion they do lose the ball, they've won it right back within five seconds.

Argentina are playing champagne football. 🇦🇷 pic.twitter.com/y2u5IqqUPy — Roy Nemer (@RoyNemer) October 12, 2023

25th min: Julian Alvarez has a shot saved from a very tight angle by Carlos Coronel, conceding a corner. The chance was threaded in beautifully by his strike partner Lautaro Martinez. The set-piece is looped well off target by the head of Cristian Romero.

21st min: The first yellow card of the game is shown to Junior Alonso who comes flying into a challenge with Alexis Mac Allister and catches him high on the ankle. A very bad tackle — not quite worthy of a red, but it's not far off either.

16th min: Ouch, Lautaro Martinez tries to latch onto a wonderful vertical flick from Enzo Fernandez up the gut, but he's just a split-second too late, and he goes sliding into the ribs of Paraguay goalkeeper Carlos Coronel. That looked painful for the Red Bulls goalie, but he's ok to continue.

It's a bit surprising that Lautaro got away with no booking from that really dangerous decision.

13th min: Chance, Argentina! Oh no, it's a terribly bad miss from Nico Gonzalez. The Argentine winger breaks down the left, and with the Paraguay defense lagging behind, he's got plenty of room to shoot across the face of goal from a somewhat tight angle.

The ""shot"" is so bad it's hard to tell if he was trying to put it on frame or square it for a teammate at the back post, but it's a tragic attempt either way, as there was nobody anywhere close at the far stick to meet it.

9th min: Paraguay get their first attacking move playing long to the striker, but after a few nervy moments the Argentina defense recovers and gets back on the ball.

4th min: GOAL! ARGENTINA! IT'S A GOLAZO FROM THE CAPTAIN NICOLAS OTAMENDI!

The first corner of the match goes to Argentina, and as Rodrigo de Paul floats it deep and over the pack, it comes to the Argentina defender who produces an absolutely STUNNING whipped volley, and strikes the ball cleanly by chopping his leg down on the bouncing ball, blasting it through the trees and into the back of the net!

Kickoff: The match is under way from Buenos Aires! Lionel Messi starts on the bench for Argentina, but should come into the match early in the second half. We'll see what Lautaro Martinez and Julian Alvarez can do together up front against Paraguay under new management.

Argentina vs Paraguay: Pre-match commentary, analysis, stats, and more

15 mins to kickoff: Darwin Nunez deposited a late penalty for Uruguay to share the points with Colombia in a 2-2 draw. It's far too early to be watching outside results too intently, but regardless, that's a great result for Paraguay, who will want every CONMEBOL nation outside the top two to drop as many points as possible.

The messier it gets around Paraguay, the better a chance they have of securing a qualifying spot in the expanded World Cup field.

30 mins to kickoff: Paraguay have a new manager, as Daniel Garnero makes his debut as the new permanent boss. He spent the last two years in charge of Paraguayan giants Libertad, taking over for Guillermo Barros Schelotto who was let go after the September qualifiers just three days shy of his two-year hire anniversary.

54-year-old Garnero is an Argentine who made one appearance for the national team as a player, and spent most of his career with Argentine club Independiente. He's managed at the club level in Paraguay since 2015 with Sol de America, Guarani, and Olimpia before his spell at Libertad.

It's quite the test for Garnero in his debut match, taking on Lionel Messi and the defending World Cup champions Argentina, his home nation. My intention is always to play with the ball. We must be smart and aggressive in recoveries."" A bold claim by the Paraguay boss.

""Vamos a jugar contra una selección que es la mejor del mundo. No solamente por logros, sino por idea colectiva y rendimientos individuales. Mi intención siempre es jugar con la pelota. Debemos ser inteligentes y agresivos en las recuperaciones"".

45 mins to kickoff: This is a really big match for Lautaro Martinez. He's had an outstanding start to the Serie A season with Inter, scoring 11 goals in 10 matches, but since slumping in the World Cup, he's yet to recover his national team place.

With Lionel Messi reportedly set to come off the bench at halftime, he will have a short leash tonight with which to break his 11-match scoreless streak at the international level. Time is running out for Lautaro to prove he is still a viable selection option for Lionel Scaloni.

1 hour to kickoff: Lineups are in, and it's exactly as we thought for Argentina, with Lionel Messi on the bench while the duo of Lautaro Martinez and Julian Alvarez start together for the first time ever. Nicolas Tagliafico retains his left-back spot despite the return of Marcos Acuna.

For Paraguay, however, there's a host of changes. Ivan Ramirez comes in to play right-back for Robert Rojas for just his fourth international cap. The entire midfield three is swapped out as well, with Mattias Espinoza, Alvaro Campuzano, and Richard Sanchez entering the fray. Adam Bareiro takes over at striker for Gabriel Avalos, earning his debut international cap.

1 hour 15 mins to kick: James Rodriguez scored a golazo in the early match tonight to put Colombia in front of Uruguay 1-0 before halftime. It's his first-ever goal against Uruguay, giving him a goal against six of the nine CONMEBOL opponents.

Tonight's opponents, Argentina and Paraguay, represent two of the three teams he still has yet to score against, with Brazil the other. Uruguay had briefly leveled the match early in the second half, but Colombia restored its advantage minutes later.

1 hour 30 mins to kick: With the understanding that Lionel Messi will start tonight's match on the bench, reports indicate that Nicolas Otamendi will wear the captain's armband until Messi enters the pitch.

1 hour 45 mins to kick: There was a rumor that Lionel Messi could be headed to Barcelona on loan to cover the gap left by Inter Miami's failure to qualify for the MLS playoffs, but the rumor never made much sense, and it's been squashed on numerous fronts.

Inter Miami coach Gerardo Martino made light of the rumor in his post-match press conference over the weekend after defeat to FC Cincinnati left them mathematically eliminated, saying that he'd only go to Spain ""for fun."" Meanwhile, Fabrizio Romano also shot it down from a journalistic standpoint.

There isn't enough of a break for him to reasonably integrate with Barcelona, and at 36 years old he's sure to welcome the extended time off.

2 hours to kickoff: Lionel Messi's club Inter Miami were eliminated from MLS playoff contention after their latest defeat, a 1-0 loss to FC Cincinnati last weekend. Messi had missed the previous four matches but returned to the field for the final 30 minutes. He was powerless to turn the tide of the game, after Inter Miami had missed so many gilt-edged chances in the first half.

Had Inter Miami been still in the playoff hunt, with a potential postseason run on the horizon, Argentina might have played it a bit safer with Messi in this international window. Yet now that his long offseason break is confirmed, Messi may be more aggressive with his minutes here knowing that, after Inter Miami's final two meaningless regular-season matches, he will only have international breaks to keep him sharp until February.

According to a report earlier today, Messi will not start tonight, but is likely to play much or all of the second half, while Lautaro Martinez and Julian Alvarez both start a national team match for the first time. World Cup hero Mario Kempes is a big fan of that.

""No deberíamos entrar en la polémica, como pasó con Batistuta y Crespo. Lautaro tuvo un bajón en el Mundial, entró Julián y cambió muchos las cosas, pero ahora volvió a hacer goles. Y Julián es muy molesto. Corre y marca. Son dos grandes 9"".

Argentina vs Paraguay starting lineups & team news

Argentina head coach Lionel Scaloni named a bloated 36-man squad for the matches against Paraguay and Peru this month, but Angel Di Maria, Paulo Dybala, and Juan Foyth were forced to withdraw due to injury. Lisandro Martinez is also unavailable after having to undergo another foot operation.

Now that Inter Miami's playoff run is officially over, Argentina can feel a little better about deploying Lionel Messi at full 90-minute use despite his recent fitness issues, knowing his club season is nearly over and he'll have months of rest upcoming. Messi missed the last match against Bolivia, and missed four Inter Miami games after, but he returned for a half-hour of action in their final fixture before the international break. However, he doesn't start, but is reportedly fit enough to come off the bench for most or all of the second half.

Nicolas Tagliafico started both matches in September, and while Marcos Acuna is back with the team following an injury, the former retains his starting spot. Messi's club teammate Facundo Farias was also included on the roster but it'd be surprising if he saw the field.

Argentina starting lineup (4-3-3): E. Martinez (GK) — Molina, Romero, Otamendi, Tagliafico — De Paul, Mac Allister, E. Fernandez — J. Alvarez, L. Martinez, N. Gonzalez.

Argentina subs (12): Armani (GK), Musso (GK), Quarta, Montiel, Acuna, Ocampos, Paredes, Lo Celso, Pezzella, G. Rodriguez, Garnacho, Messi.

Paraguay head coach Daniel Garnero has rung the changes after falling to Venezuela last time out, making five alterations to that starting lineup. The entire midfield is swapped out, while Adam Bareiro takes over at striker, earning his debut international cap in place of Gabriel Avalos.

Forward Miguel Almiron is Paraguay's most prominent goalscoring threat and is in good form, with three goals in his past five matches for Newcastle United.

Paraguay have questions at goalkeeper, as mainstay Antony Silva has been phased out, leaving three inexperienced internationals currently on the roster. New York Red Bulls starter Carlos Coronel earned his first two caps in the September matches and he remains in net here. Lionel Messi's Inter Miami teammate Diego Gomez was named to the Paraguay roster but was forced to withdraw due to injury.

Paraguay starting lineup (5-4-1): C. Coronel (GK) — I. Ramirez, G. Gomez, Balbuena, Alonso, Espinoza — R Sanchez, Campuzano, Almiron, Bareiro — Sosa.

Paraguay subs (12): Rojas (GK), Espinola (GK), R. Rojas, Alderete, Avalos, Sanabria, Villaba, Galarza, M. Rojas, A. Romero, Gimenez, Ojeda.

How to watch Argentina vs Paraguay

Following an agreement at the 11th hour of the September international break, broadcast rights for Argentina's home World Cup qualifiers in the United States have been secured by Telemundo and Univision. That means viewers in the USA can watch this match on Universo, with streaming on Fubo as well as the company's premium subscription services.

The match is not set to be available globally to regions including Australia, Canada, and the United Kingdom, as CONMEBOL has yet to sell broadcast rights to a provider in those territories.

Other territories with broadcast options for this match include Malaysia (Astro Supersport), Argentina (TyC Sports), Brazil (SporTV 2), France (L'Equipe Web), Spain (Movistar), and Saudi Arabia (SSC).

sports,Kyle Bonn,2023-11-30T21:41:00+00:00,"With the 2023 MLS season closing earlier than expected for Inter Miami, eliminated from playoff contention, Lionel Messi will have significant time off before the new campaign begins in February 2024.

With every new season come preseason friendlies, as the players hope to ramp up their match fitness prior to the start of the coming campaign. Players need game time to build their bodies to the point where they can play full 90-minute matches, especially when they are contesting multiple games a week.

Inter Miami's preseason will be watched with extra observation as Messi draws considerable attention wherever he goes, home or abroad. The Argentina star had looked like being part of a tour of China, although that's no longer the case, while the prospect of facing a familiar side from home is a tantalising one.

The Sporting News has compiled all the known preseason matches either confirmed or reported prior to the start of Inter Miami's 2024 season.

Inter Miami friendly matches for 2024 preseason

Below are all the known fixtures that have either been confirmed by the club directly or widely reported by media.

It was anticipated that Inter Miami would embark on a two-match tour of China, but that has now been cancelled, with the trip proving too difficult logistically to arrange. It was replaced by a friendly against fellow MLS side NYCFC to honor Lionel Messi's Ballon d'Or.

The biggest confirmed match is the meeting between Messi and rival Cristiano Ronaldo as Inter Miami announced a pair of fixtures in Saudi Arabia, including against Ronaldo's Al Nassr on February 1.

Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo will meet in a club friendly between Inter Miami and Al Nassr in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia on Thursday, February 1 with kickoff at 1 p.m. ET (9 p.m. local time in Saudi Arabia).

The match comes as the second of a double-header for Inter Miami in Saudi Arabia as part of the annual Riyadh Season Cup showcase. Three days prior, Inter Miami will also meet fellow Saudi club Al Hilal.

Messi and Ronaldo have squared off 35 times across their careers, with Messi winning 16 times to Ronaldo's 10, plus nine draws. Messi claimed the most recent face-off as PSG won their friendly matchup 5-4 in Riyadh last time around.

Inter Miami to play El Salvador in January

Inter Miami's first confirmed friendly of the 2024 preseason will see the club travel to San Sebastian to take on the El Salvador national team on January 19.

The match does not fall under an official FIFA international window, meaning the national team will likely not feature any players from Europe or other leagues currently in season.

""We look forward to facing the El Salvador national team in what will be a good first test for our squad against the best players from the country,” said Chief Soccer Officer and Sporting Director Chris Henderson.

Ticketing and broadcast details will be available at a later date.

Inter Miami visit Hong Kong in February tour of Asia

The club announced in early December that Inter Miami would take a tour of Asia in early February as part of their 2024 preseason slate.

The trip will see Inter Miami play a collection of top players from the Hong Kong First Division. The match will be played on February 4 at Hong Kong Stadium, which seats approximately 40,000 fans, while the club will hold an open training session the day prior. Tickets go on sale December 15 on ticket exchange site Klook.

While the match is the only one in Asia confirmed as of yet, Inter Miami's reference of the trip as a ""tour of Asia"" suggests more matches could be announced in due time. It's notable that Inter Miami will indeed travel to Asia after their attempts to play matches in China back in November fell through.

""We're very excited to be visiting Hong Kong and indeed Asia for the very first time,"" explained Jorge Mas, Inter Miami CF Managing Owner. ""From the very beginning we set out to be a global club at Inter Miami. This is a wonderful opportunity to do just that; we hope to enthuse and inspire new Inter Miami fans in Hong Kong and across Asia who share our passion for fútbol.""

“Hong Kong is a beautiful city with a great sports scene,” added Inter Miami CF Co-Owner, David Beckham. “Throughout my career, I have spent a lot of time in Asia - I am so pleased to have the opportunity to bring Inter Miami to play our first international tour match in this fantastic city.”

Vissel Kobe to face Inter Miami in Tokyo

Following the match with Hong Kong, Inter Miami will head to Tokyo to take on J1 League champions Vissel Kobe.

The game will take place at the Japan National Stadium and feature a very special guest: Andres Iniesta.

Spain's World Cup-winning midfielder spent five years with Vissel Kobe after spending his entire club career until that point with Barcelona, where he played alongside Messi, Sergio Busquets and Jordi Alba during an era of astonishing success in Catalonia.

""Vissel Kobe is a powerhouse club in Asia coming off of a historic season after winning the J1 League, so we're thrilled about this opportunity to sharpen our team in a match like this one. We continue to look for the best ways to prepare for 2024, and feel confident this match and this tour will help us do that,"" said Chief Soccer Officer and Sporting Director Chris Henderson.

Boyhood Messi club to face Inter Miami in USA

After their Asia trip, Inter Miami will host a friendly at DRV PNK Stadium against Newell's Old Boys.

The team from Argentina hold a special place in the heart of Messi and Martino. Not only are both men from the city of Rosario, where Newell's are based, but Messi developed at the club's youth academy and Martino played more than 400 senior games for the club before becoming head coach in 2012.

""I am delighted to welcome my beloved Newell's to our home here in Miami. It will be a special match due to everything Newell's Old Boys means to me,"" said the Inter Miami coach. ""It will also be a good opportunity to prepare for what will surely be an exciting season.""

Messi signed for Barcelona after spending six years as a youth player at Newell's, during which time he reportedly scored 234 goals.

Will Inter Miami face River Plate in Dallas?

In late November, it was reported that Inter Miami have arranged to contest a friendly against Argentine giants River Plate in Dallas, Texas in late January.

According to Argentine journalist German Balcarce of River Plate publication RMG, the match will take place on January 20 and will be played at AT&T Stadium, the home of the Dallas Cowboys. However, with the El Salvador friendly, which is confirmed by the club, happening literally the day before in El Salvador, it would be impossible for Inter Miami to play this match as reported unless they split the squad.

The match would supposedly be the second leg of a two-part trip for River Plate, who will also meet Liga MX club Deportivo Guadalajara (formerly Chivas) on January 17 at the same venue. This will be updated with any additional information on whether this match will be moved to another day or nixed entirely.

Inter Miami play NYCFC in Noche d'Or to replace China trip

With the club's elimination from 2023 MLS playoff contention, Lionel Messi is facing nearly a full month off from competitive fixtures before he takes the field for Argentina against Uruguay and Brazil in CONMEBOL World Cup qualifying.

Likely with the sole intent of keeping Messi fit in that time off, and the added bonus of raking in significant cash, Inter Miami scheduled a two-match tour of China in early November after their regular season concluded.

They were expected to visit two Chinese Super League sides, starting with a match against Qingdao Hainiu on November 5, followed by a game against Chengdu Rongcheng three days later However, it was reported on October 30 the planned tour was off. Gaston Edu of TyC Sports reported the visit had been cancelled due to ""commercial and bureaucratic"" reasons.

Instead, Inter Miami met NYCFC in a hastily arranged friendly at DRV PNK Stadium on November 10 to honor Lionel Messi's most recent Ballon d'Or.

This time was supposed to be different. This Ireland team were different… are different. But, come the end, the result was the same. On quarter-final weekend, for the eighth time in 10 Rugby World Cups, Ireland head home defeated and the wait for a first-ever knockout win goes on.

You could feel the desperation around the Stade de France, awash with green thanks to the Irish fans doing their part, as Ireland went through phase after phase after phase after phase hunting the try that could overturn the 28-24 scoreline staring back at them from the giant screen.

A move that started well inside their own half, with 77 minutes on the clock, ended 37 phases and five minutes later in heartbreak. Thirty-seven gruelling phases of Bundee Aki grinding out extra yards with each punishing carry, Tadhg Beirne left at a literal standstill through tiredness and Johnny Sexton – for the final time ahead of retirement – running the famous wraparound upon which he’s built maybe the greatest Ireland career of all-time. But it ended, almost inevitably, with a turnover deep in the New Zealand 22, the ball being kicked to touch and the men in green sinking to the floor bereft.

This is the greatest Ireland team of all time, they may still even be the best team in the world but on this day, the quarter-final curse, not to mention an inspired All Blacks side, ruled once more.

This defeat will hurt more than any other. Truthfully, since 1991 when Michael Lynagh’s late try handed Australia victory, Ireland hadn’t come close to ending their last-eight hoodoo. Never mind winning one, they haven’t led a World Cup quarter-final since the first half of the 1995 defeat to France, a mammoth 10,353 days ago.

But here they had a legitimate chance to reverse the curse. Multiple times they got within a point of the All Blacks, only for their opponents to agonisingly pull away once more. And then there were those 37 phases… the most painful finish in Irish rugby history.

Ireland were left bereft after an agonising defeat (PA Wire)

Instead of being feted as the heroes to finally overcome that insurmountable obstacle, the Ireland players will still have to answer endless questions about the heavy burden of previous knockout failures and fans will endure at least four more years of choking jokes at their expense.

As for the All Blacks, they looked lost at times during this World Cup cycle and it’s still faintly remarkable that head coach Ian Foster survived last summer as the home defeats to Ireland, South Africa and Argentina piled up.

Yet somehow, he hung on and turned things round. He has the unwanted title of being the first New Zealand coach to lose a World Cup pool match but now a semi-final awaits next Friday evening against an Argentina side that, frankly, are a tier below them. Forget the hand-wringing ahead of the tournament, the All Blacks are one very small step away from another World Cup final.

Foster will leave his role after the World Cup, to be replaced by all-conquering Crusaders boss Scott Robertson, but he can still exit with the greatest prize of all. And frankly, who would bet against the All Blacks now?

The opening-night nerves against France seem a long time ago and they ultimately had too much for Ireland in this simply incredible, back-and-forth Test match that may genuinely go down as one of the best of all time.

After early penalties from Richie Mo’unga and Jordie Barrett, they scored a scintillating try through Leicester Fainga’anuku, who was only in the starting XV due to Mark Telea’s breach of team protocol earlier in the week. Beauden Barrett expertly dinked over the top, collected his own chip and when the ball was spread wide, Fainga’anuku and Rieko Ioane neatly combined to send the former over in the corner.

They led 13-0 and though they may not have realised, no team had ever squandered a lead that large in a World Cup quarter-final. Not that they would have expected an easy ride from there.

They conceded a penalty straight from the restart as their kick chase was illegally impeded and Sexton duly slotted the three.

Ireland had made something of a statement during the Haka as their fans drowned it out with a rousing rendition of Fields of Athenry and the players formed a figure of eight in memory of ex-international and Munster coach Anthony Foley, who tragically died in 2016, as they stared down their opponents. But the first real in-match statement came on 27 minutes as New Zealand-born Aki – perhaps the player of the World Cup so far who had made a tournament-high 61 carries, 33 dominant carries and 23 defenders beaten heading into the weekend – brilliantly jinked inside two defenders, fended off another and powered through a gap to dive over the line.

Yet more All-Black class saw Ardie Savea go over in the corner after quick ball was shipped wide but with scrum-half Aaron Smith in the sin-bin for a deliberate knock-on, Ireland narrowed the gap to 18-17 just before the break as another New Zealand-born Irish star, Jamison Gibson-Park, sniped from a lineout maul and somehow stretched out for the try.

The All Blacks extended an incredible record of leading at half-time of their quarter-final in every single World Cup but that lead had never felt more fragile.

The All Blacks eventually prevailed in Paris (Reuters)

The second half followed a similar, rollercoaster pattern as every time Ireland got close, their opponents found a way to stretch the lead. Mo’unga’s sumptuous dummy and sleight of hand from first-phase lineout ball froze two Irish defenders and led to a scything break before he fed speedster Will Jordan to race over the whitewash.

That extended the gap to eight points but a penalty try as an Irish driving maul was illegally hauled down closed it to 25-24 with 17 minutes to go and sent Codie Taylor for 10 minutes in the sin-bin.

Yet this All Blacks team suddenly have a resilience about them and brushed off the underdog status they had been given in the build-up to this game as their tireless back row continually disrupted breakdowns and a disciplined defence refused to yield.

Jordie Barrett added a penalty to take the score to 28-24 and that’s how it eventually stayed. While Ireland will rue the 37 phases that ended in heartbreak, they may just go down in New Zealand rugby history. Tired bodies made tackle after tackle and not a single penalty was given away.

The delight at the final whistle showed this wasn’t just any quarter-final victory and while Ireland ponder just what they have to do to finally win a World Cup knockout match, the All Blacks can dream of lifting the Webb Ellis Cup for a fourth time. The pain and ecstasy of sport writ large.",Thirty-seven phases of agony define Ireland’s greatest heartbreak as curse continues,https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/rugby/rugby-union/ireland-new-zealand-all-blacks-result-rugby-world-cup-b2429900.html,The Independent - Sports
sports,Mike Meehall Wood,2023-12-07T22:28:31+00:00,"Spurs have fallen to their fourth defeat in five with a 2-1 reverse at home to West Ham – and they only have themselves to blame.

Ange Postecoglou’s men were sitting pretty at 1-0 up thanks to an early Cristian Romero header, then missed a host of chances to extend their lead against a Hammers side who couldn’t get out of their own end.

Yet after spurning their own opportunities, Tottenham presented two gift-wrapped chances to their opponents.

Facebook Twitter Whatsapp Reddit Email Share

Their defence was nowhere to be seen as Mohammed Kudus was able to shoot, with his effort deflecting off two Spurs players and into the path of Jarrod Bowen to level the scores.

Then Destiny Udogie’s blind backpass allowed James Ward-Prowse an easy shot on goal, and while he hit the post, the rebound fell perfectly for the midfielder to finish on the rebound.

“It’s unacceptable,” said captain Heung-Min Son.

“I think players should take responsibility, this is unacceptable.

“The fans don’t deserve this, especially when you play at home, when you go 1-0 up early on you should play with even more energy but we didn’t, and that’s why we lost.

“West Ham have always been tough to play against so we knew what was coming.

“But we were soft, and especially in the Premier League, even when you’re winning 2-0, 3-0, you don’t know what’s going to happen in the end. 1-0 is not enough, you have to try to kill the game.”

The coach wasn’t quite as damning, but still described the showing as poor.

“It’s another game where we’ve dominated a game of football but we haven’t taken advantage,” said Postecoglou.

“I thought we were poor in both areas with our finishing and also both goals we conceded were terrible.

There’s no point in feeling sorry for ourselves, looking for a cuddle anywhere. There’s only one way to change our circumstances and that is to come here on Sunday and put in a performance, not just play good football but go out there and show some conviction about ourselves as a team.

“Sometimes we can disguise how we’re going by playing some nice stuff but like I said from day one, that’s not what I’m about.

“I want to win and that’s why I came to this football club and that’s the message. We’ve still got a long way to go, I’ve said that from the start, we’re still right at the beginning what we need to create and days like today just give me further evidence and fuel of how much we need to do.”

On Optus Sport, ex-Spurs boss Tim Sherwood tore strips off Spurs.

“They’re quietly having a bad run, it’s five without a win now,” he said.

“They’ve led in every game and I’ve said when they take the lead, I wouldn’t say the game is over. It’s not good enough.

“But they’ve changed. The last three or four years they’ve been watching some dross there but it’s better to watch. It’s game management.

“They go ahead and they’re already winning the game but they try and win it again and again and leave themselves open. Jarrod Bowen was outstanding out there and you can really exploit them. They leave space and they make poor decisions on the ball and it’s costing them at the moment.”

Spurs had rebounded from three consecutive defeats with a stirring 3-3 draw at Manchester City over the weekend, but are now outside the Champions League qualification spots in fifth place – and level with Manchester United.

West Ham aren’t far behind, with this result lifting them to ninth, just three points back from Spurs.

“Huge performance because of the quality of the opposition,” said coach David Moyes.

“We were up against it tonight. We had to dig in. Thankfully we just about scraped it.

“The quality Tottenham showed in the first half, I don’t know if we touched the ball for eight or nine minutes.

“We gained a bit of confidence once we got some passes. We wanted to get after them a bit more but by the same breath we were cautious about them picking us off.

“We are a team who can give some of the good teams a bloody nose, we have that in us.”

In the other match, Everton trounced Newcastle 3-0 to move clear of the relegation zone despite their ten point penalty for financial irregularities.

They left it late, with goals from Dwight McNeil, Abdoulaye Doucoure and Brazilian striker Beto enough to down the Magpies.

“Without those 10 points, we’d be in an amazing position,” said Toffees boss Sean Dyche. “20 points would be amazing relatively to the last two seasons here.

“We’ll see what the appeal brings. The mentality is key for me, we took a knock but there have been a lot of knocks here over the last couple of years.

“But the team mentality is growing. I can’t emphasise it enough, the commitment to each other and the connection is a powerful thing because I know we’ve got quality.”

Eddie Howe’s side are proving one of the most inconsistent in the league, albeit with a lengthy injury list.

In the last month, they have defeated Manchester United, Arsenal and Chelsea – as well as drawing at French heavyweights PSG in the Champions League – but have now lost comfortably to two cellar dwellers in Everton and Bournemouth.

“We have to do better,” said Howe.

“There are reasons behind every performance and we have struggled to change players. That is a big miss with the quality of players out. The longer you do it, the harder it gets. I am disappointed, a missed opportunity, we did not grab it.

“The game was there for us to win in the second half. The first half was even and we had them penned in in the second half. We conceded the first goal and it changed the momentum of the match.

sports,Andy Hunter,2023-10-20T21:30:28+00:00,"Three points off the top, three goals scored in every Premier League home game, a 100% record in all competitions at Anfield, cruising through the Europa League group stage and individuals shining; it is fair to say Liverpool have surpassed the pre-season expectations of a new-look team. It is not unreasonable of Jürgen Klopp, however, to expect much more as the season develops.

“You saw so many teams here growing in the direction we wanted and all became better step by step or the manager had to go,” said Klopp on the demands of his particular job. “We will try together to get better step by step and show our real face more often than not.”

The 243rd edition of the most played derby in English football offers an ideal opportunity for Liverpool to grant Klopp’s request given the one-sided nature of the fixture on his watch, regardless of another early kick-off after an international break playing havoc with preparations. Klopp has lost one of his 17 encounters with Everton, Liverpool one of the past 23 Premier League meetings at Anfield and one of the past 25 league derbies home or away.

Liverpool’s defensive concerns, heightened by the loss of Andy Robertson for up to three months with a shoulder injury, are offset by the visitors’ troubles in front of goal. A 3-0 defeat of Bournemouth last time out was only the eighth time Everton have scored more than once in a Premier League match in the past 12 months. The overall improvement in Everton’s performance, however, coupled with three wins in the past four games, raises Sean Dyche hopes of capitalising on any post-international fatigue in the opposition ranks. Klopp’s compliments towards Dyche and his local rivals were of the back-handed nature.

“Everton are in a good moment,” he said. “Burnley in their best moments [under Dyche] were a super-difficult team to play against and you can see that again; it’s similar with different players. We have to be ready for second ball fights, runs in behind, a compact defence. It will be a tough one. Burnley games were always tough. We have to have football understanding, patience, put a proper shift in and take the fight.”

What Klopp is seeking most of all from Liverpool is consistency throughout the 90-plus minutes of a Premier League game. It was achieved in the commanding 3-0 defeat of an in-form Aston Villa early last month, a performance that carried echoes of Liverpool at their dominant best under Klopp, but other highlights, even in victory, have been interspersed with lapses. The manager believes some instability is inevitable given this summer’s midfield rebuild.

“Yes it is [a factor] but we’ve also changed between games quite a lot because of the amount of games and we’ve been interrupted by international breaks twice now,” he said. “If it is a more settled team it doesn’t make that much of a difference because we are much more used to each other and that is not the case yet. As a group we have to become consistent but you do it step by step.

“It is not too long ago that we had the problem of performing on a really high level until we didn’t perform at all any more; we were 1-0 or 2-0 up in a game and all of a sudden we came under pressure. Crazy. We had to learn to control the game. It is all the things that happen with time – there is no shortcut to that. With the signs we showed so far I am absolutely fine but I don’t know the final destination, I can’t even see that yet, but it is not a problem because other teams have similar problems. It is about how quick we can make the steps and that is what we are working on every day but the problem now is how could we work since Brighton [where Liverpool drew 2-2]? We had three, with a goalie, first-team players in training until Wednesday. Tomorrow we have to play with what we did so far but in general you have to gain stability bit by bit.”

It has arrived in attack, where Darwin Núñez’s influence has improved considerably since his match-winning cameo for the 10 men of Liverpool at Newcastle. Mohamed Salah has scored or assisted in 14 consecutive Premier League matches and Liverpool could emulate their predecessors from 1980-81 by scoring three or more goals in the opening four home league games. Stopping goals has been the problem, with Liverpool conceding first and cheaply on occasions. Klopp insists he has not built another formidable attack at the expense of a resilient defence; it is just another step Liverpool have to make.

“I like to build a team from the defensive side,” he said. “I’m not sure it’s possible again nowadays when you’re in the middle of something. Imagine if we kept clean sheets but didn’t create. You have time for these things when you are new [to a club], when things are under average before you come in and you are 14th. Then everyone is happy when you get some results. We are not like that. Our team is not set up like that. We have a really talented group, a creative group in a football sense, and we have to use that. But we have to organise protection. That goes step by step.

“There are a lot of new things for the boys to consider and that takes time. We had a good pre-season and I loved the steps we made there but the rest we have learned during the season. During the season you are massively influenced by results. The difference when we win a game – and it’s not a problem for me – is I have to make players aware of things that are not right yet. It is a different feeling if you lose or draw a game. It’s been two weeks since we played a football game together so it’s not possible to work by looking at the Brighton game any more. We have to make sure we are ready for this one.”

sports,Sloan Piva,2023-12-13T20:32:00+00:00,"It's somehow already mid-December, meaning millions of fantasy football owners just reached their respective ""offseason."" Luckily for those who missed the playoffs, there's Week 15 DFS. We hold the key to consistent daily fantasy success: pinpointing and playing the cheapest sleepers and highest-ceiling value plays each week.

Every Tuesday, we scour DraftKings, FanDuel, and SuperDraft for affordable sleepers and under-the-radar value plays that will set you apart from the DFS pack. By finding stud production at modest prices, we allow ourselves plenty of remaining budget to afford elite weekly performers at other roster spots. When our studs and our sleepers hit, we usually win.

We do all the leg work for you -- poring over the player pools, like my daughter searching the Target Christmas catalog — then we handpick the most promising sleepers and tell you why they're worth drafting to your next DFS squad. All you have to do is choose your favorites, sit back, and relax.

WEEK 15 FANTASY ADVICE:

Sleepers | Busts | Projections | Start-sit

If daily fantasy was as easy as picking all top-end skill-position players from one week to the next, it would be a lot easier to win the milli-maker. Let's face it, in order to win big, we need to hit on some diamonds in the rough, and in order to afford a CeeDee Lamb ($9,200 on DK), we have to invest in the occasional Demarcus Robinson ($3,600).

We have enjoyed consistent success with our DFS sleepers and values all season. Each Tuesday, we share a big list of our hits from the previous week. — with each hit typically netting at least 16-22 fantasy points. Throughout the year, we've been consistently ahead of the game on breakouts like Puka Nacua, Kyren Williams, and Tank Dell, among many others.

Take a look at our collection of hits from last week:

Pos. Player Wk. 14 Game DK Price Pts QB Baker Mayfield Buccaneers at Falcons $5,300 20.1 QB Russell Wilson Broncos at Chargers $5,800 19.5 QB Gardner Minshew Colts at Bengals $5,400 16.1 RB Joe Mixon Bengals vs. Colts $6,100 21.5 RB Javonte Williams Broncos at Chargers $5,800 18.1 WR Garrett Wilson Jets vs. Texans $5,500 23.1 WR Rashee Rice Chiefs vs. Bills $5,400 19.2 WR Courtland Sutton Broncos at Chargers $6,100 15.2 TE Isaiah Likely Ravens vs. Rams $3,500 19.3 DST Cleveland Browns vs. Jaguars $3,000 12.0

Now that's what we call a strong week! We averaged over 19 DK points per position player and 18.4 per position while spending just under $5,200 per pick. Rostering that kind of cheap production allowed us to find consistent weekly studs at other positions while setting us apart from the pack through lineup variance.

Let's shower, rinse, repeat! This year, we're also incorporating SuperDraft into our weekly DFS column. For those unfamiliar, SuperDraft's DFS scoring involves point multipliers as opposed to traditional salary-capped or tiered contests. A winning lineup will likely feature a strong mix of stud fantasy contributors with 1x-1.6x boosts, as well as matchup-based sleepers with larger multipliers. Each player is assigned a scoring multiplier based on their value as determined by SuperDraft. So, the sleepers who carry lower salaries in DK/FD have higher boosts on SD. The best part: SuperDraft users can roster any player with no restrictions.

Now, to our picks. Below we will reveal our Week 15 DFS sleepers and values at each position. Good luck, have fun, and enjoy what will undoubtedly be another wild week!

All player values are from DraftKings, FanDuel, and SuperDraft. All stats are from NFL.com and Pro Football Reference.

NFL DFS Picks Week 15: QB sleepers, values for DraftKings, FanDuel, SuperDraft

Brock Purdy, 49ers at Cardinals (DK: $6,800 | FD: $8,400 | SD: 1.2x)

We usually don't feature players with salaries higher than $6,200 on DK and $8,000 on FD, but $6,800 on DK just seems like a massive value for the MVP frontrunner. Purdy has been scorching, with 57.9 DK points over San Francisco's past two games and at least 23.8 in five of the Niners' past six. The Cards rank among the 10 most generous defenses to QBs on DK, so we're all over the young gunslinger in the desert this weekend.

Jordan Love, Packers vs. Buccaneers (DK: $6,200 | FD: $8,000 | SD: 1.25x)

Love and the Packers' pass-catchers have emerged as legit offensive threats over the past month, finally easing the Cheeseheads' anguish over the departure of Aaron Rodgers. Cult hero Tommy DeVito hit the pause button on Green Bay's good times, but it should start rolling again this weekend at home against a miserable Tampa Bay secondary. The Bucs have surrendered the fourth-most FD points and fifth-most DK points to QBs this season, and Plodmaster General AJ Dillon ain't about to crack their strong front-seven. We love Love this weekend, and not just because we're lovers at heart.

Other solid Week 15 values: Matthew Stafford, Rams vs. Commanders (DK: $6,000 | FD: $7,200 | SD: 1.3x); Derek Carr, Saints vs. Giants (DK: $5,800 | FD: $6,500 | SD: 1.35x); Joe Flacco, Browns vs. Bears (DK: $5,500 | FD: $7,100 | SD: 1.35x); Will Levis, Titans vs. Texans (DK: $5,400 | FD: $6,800 | SD: 1.35x)

WEEK 15 STANDARD RANKINGS:

QBs | RBs | WRs | TEs | D/STs | Kickers

NFL DFS Picks Week 15: RB sleepers, values for DraftKings, FanDuel, SuperDraft

Devin Singletary, Texans at Titans (DK: $5,400 | FD: $6,000 | SD: 1.35x)

With C.J. Stroud in the league's concussion protocol and Nico Collins (calf) joining Tank Dell (fibula) on the Texans' injury list, Houston suddenly finds itself without many impact skill-position players. Singletary, however, has been pretty damn good and showed us last week that he's the main man over Dameon Pierce in DeMeco Ryans' backfield. He had 13 carries for 65 yards and a TD against the Jets, while Pierce totaled just five touches for seven yards. Don't be scared of Tennessee's run D because it ain't what it used to be under Mike Vrabel. Raheem Mostert and De'Von Achane just posted 35.1 PPR points against the Titans, Chuba Hubbard had 20.2 a few weeks ago, and Rachaad White had 17.8 against them in Week 10.

Antonio Gibson, Commanders at Rams (DK: $5,200 | FD: $5,600 | SD: 1.4x)

Aaron Donald and friends will be attacking the pocket early and often in pursuit of Sam Howell, who has been sacked 10 more times than any other QB. Dump-offs and screens will be plentiful for Gibson, who comes at a major discount, at least in PPR formats.

More solid Week 15 RB values: Ezekiel Elliott, Patriots vs. Chiefs (DK: $5,800 | FD: $6,500 | SD: 1.35x); Jerick McKinnon, Chiefs at Patriots (DK: $5,100 | FD: $5,500 | SD: 1.45x); Jordan Mason, 49ers at Cardinals (DK: $4,600 | FD: $4,200 | SD: 1.6x); Tyler Allgeier, Falcons at Panthers (DK: $4,400 | FD: $5,700 | SD: 1.6x)

WEEK 15 PPR RANKINGS:

QBs | RBs | WRs | TEs | D/STs | Kickers

NFL DFS Picks Week 15: WR sleepers, values for DraftKings, FanDuel, SuperDraft

Rashee Rice, Chiefs at Patriots (DK: $6,100 | FD: $6,500 | SD: 1.35x)

With Isiah Pacheco (shoulder) banged up, Rice seems like Kansas City's best skill-position player this side of Travis Kelce. He's certainly the most sure-handed wideout on the Chiefs (not saying much, but still), and he has electric after-the-catch playmaking ability (which is good, considering Patrick Mahomes has struggled with deep-ball accuracy). The rookie has quietly posted 57.3 PPR points over the past three weeks! Since Bill Belichick's defense typically makes it a point to neutralize the opposition's top threat, which is obviously Kelce this weekend, look for Rice to bust some chunk-yard plays through the screen game and dump-downs.

Romeo Doubs, Packers vs. Buccaneers (DK: $5,300 | FD: $6,400 | SD: 1.45x)

Doubs has been one of the more dependable offensive weapons in Green Bay's offense, and Tampa Bay's secondary has been utterly abysmal all season, so we're rolling with the young wideout in a handful of lineups this weekend. Doubs has a good floor, logging 11-plus DK points eight times, and a decent ceiling (at least 18.3 three times). Fire him up in what should be a pass-heavy matchup at Lambeau.

Demarcus Robinson, Rams vs. Commanders (DK: $3,600 | FD: $5,600 | SD: 1.7x)

Robinson has become one of Matthew Stafford's most trusted receivers, drawing a 21.8-percent target share over the past two weeks. And the veteran has made the most of his opportunities, collecting seven catches for 101 yards and two TDs during that span. The Commanders are terrible at defending the pass — even worse than they were earlier in the season since they shipped out multiple impact pass-rushers. Washington has surrendered the most FanDuel points and second-most DraftKings points to wide receivers this season. Run DMC into your DFS lineups this weekend.

More solid Week 15 WR values: Amari Cooper, Browns vs. Bears (DK: $6,000 | FD: $7,200 | SD: 1.35x); Garrett Wilson, Jets at Dolphins (DK: $5,800 | FD: $6,900 | SD: 1.4x); Brandin Cooks, Cowboys at Bills (DK: $5,200 | FD: $6,300 | SD: 1.45x); A.T. Perry, Saints vs. Giants (DK: $3,500 | FD: $4,700 | SD: 1.7x)

WEEK 15 DFS:

DK lineup | FD lineup | Best stacks

NFL DFS Picks Week 15: TE sleepers, values for DraftKings, FanDuel, SuperDraft

David Njoku, Browns vs. Bears (DK: $4,700 | FD: $6,200 | SD: 1.3x)

Njoku went nuclear last weekend, catching six of his eight targets from Joe Flacco for 91 yards and two touchdowns. Now he gets a chance for an encore against the Bears, who have surrendered the 10th-most PPR points to tight ends this season. No joke, dude — you can trust Njoku!

More solid Week 15 TE values: Logan Thomas, Commanders at Rams (DK: $3,700 | FD: $5,100 | SD: 1.5x); Cade Otton, Buccaneers at Packers (DK: $3,200 | FD: $5,200 | SD: 1.65x); Tucker Kraft, Packers vs. Buccaneers (DK: $3,000 | FD: $4,700 | SD: 1.8x)

NFL DFS Picks Week 15: D/ST sleepers, values for DraftKings, FanDuel

Los Angeles Rams vs. Commanders (DK: $3,100 | FD: $4,300)

The Rams got destroyed by MVP candidate Lamar Jackson and the high-flying Ravens in Week 14, but push that out of your memory banks. Before that game, Sean McVay's squad had surrendered 20 or fewer points in four straight contests. Aaron Donald and company also have 17 sacks and six takeaways over their past six games, so they'll be licking their chops looking across the line at Sam Howell this weekend. No QB has more interceptions than Howell, who has also taken 10 more sacks than any other signal-caller this season.

More solid Week 15 D/ST plays: Chicago Bears at Browns (DK: $3,300 | FD: $4,100); New York Jets at Dolphins (DK: $2,700 | FD: $3,600); New England Patriots vs. Chiefs (DK: $2,300 | FD: $3,200)","NFL DFS picks Week 15: Best sleepers, value players for FanDuel, DraftKings, SuperDraft lineups",https://www.sportingnews.com/us/fantasy/news/dfs-picks-week-15-draftkings-fanduel-sleepers-value-lineup/49b050404a7a45697029c296,Sporting News

Another infamous European night at Old Trafford. It should be a landmark low, but almost the most deflating element of this 1-0 defeat to Bayern Munich was how grimly routine it all felt.

Manchester United, one of the grandest and richest names in this competition, have again gone out of the Champions League at the group stage. It is the third time it has happened since Sir Alex Ferguson, meaning it’s their most common round of exit in that period.

The performance this season was so bad that they find themselves out of Europe altogether as the bottom team in the group, although some at the club might find solace from that. There wasn’t much else. The second place they aimed for has instead gone to Copenhagen, a club with a fraction of United’s budget. That is where the damage was done.

While that meant there was only ever a slim hope of going through – and the Danish side’s victory over Galatasaray ensured any win would be irrelevant – the club’s rich legacy in this competition was built on such defiance. There was absolutely none of it here.

There was nothing much at all. Where was the energy? Where was the intensity? The Stretford End eventually implored United to “attack attack attack” but the complete absence of any such impulses eventually left some of the stadium booing the side off at the end.

With United out of Europe, there are questions about Erik ten Hag’s ability to coach the team (AFP via Getty Images)

These are not the sounds we are used to hearing after that Champions League theme. Something does stir when the anthem is played at Old Trafford amid the lights. Well, for most, that is, except the players.

This is why there are growing questions for Erik ten Hag himself, even if everyone is constantly keen to put it in a wider context.

Manchester United should not be performing like this on what is supposed to be the classic European night at Old Trafford. This just reminded that all they are going to have for some time are their memories.

It was another utterly forgettable display.

Bayern, already through but perhaps looking to make a point after their own 5-1 defeat to Eintracht Frankfurt, didn’t even need to step it up to win. They were quite low-intensity themselves, Kingsley Coman’s winning goal coming from the forward almost walking through the middle of their team. Harry Kane, for so long billed as a potential United player, didn’t score but did set it up.

This game showed one reason why he is at Germany’s biggest club rather than England’s. His side are through with ease, among the favourites for the competition even if they do look lacking in a few areas.

Harry Kane’s assist was another reminder of what could have been for United (PA)

Not that you could judge from this game. It was almost a kickabout for them.

Bayern were still having more of the ball and the attacks. This was another tension for Ten Hag to overcome on the night. United were playing in quite a controlled way when they were going to eventually have to go for it, but Bayern were still getting through that with relative ease.

It meant the team almost looked like they were in two minds, to go with how thoughts were always going to be in Copenhagen. The news came through shortly before the hour that Lukas Lerager had scored for the Danish side, although it didn’t really change the atmosphere or the energy. It was already a drab game, with a muted crowd.

It didn’t help that Bruno Fernandes blazed United’s best opportunity over the bar after good work from Aaron Wan Bissaka. It looked like it was going to be one of those games. It certainly wasn’t one of those big European nights at Old Trafford.

On 71 minutes, Bayern managed what they had been half-heartedly threatening all game. They also did it at near walking pace. Kingsley Coman had weaved his way through the centre, for the ball to eventually be worked to Harry Kane. The English forward clipped an artful ball back through for Coman who finished emphatically.

Kingsley Coman’s goal ensured Manchester United were knocked out of Europe (PA)

It was almost too easy for him. Why did Andre Onana stay so close to his line? If that sounds like the set-up for a joke… well, you can write your own punchline.

This is the current reality for United. They obviously have many more issues than the goalkeeper – as illustrated by the goal itself – but a strange season for Ten Hag’s primary signing only continues. United’s problems meanwhile combined. There were so many errors leading to the goal, to go with all of those that have characterised this entire European campaign.

That can now be talked about definitively, since it has been decisively ended. It is a low but just part of a decade of disappointment in the competition that has seen this club rise to its most emotional heights.

This game never threatened to do that. United never threatened at all. They’d been involved in so many ludicrously chaotic matches that the biggest of all ended up being a non-event.",Manchester United out of Europe after defeat to Bayern Munich,https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/manchester-united-harry-kane-champions-league-premier-league-bayern-munich-b2462954.html,The Independent - Sports
sports,Matt Lutovsky,2023-12-07T22:14:00+00:00,"This week might not matter for many fantasy football owners. Some have secured their spot in the postseason; others are well out of contention. However, for those in must-win situations, this week really matters. It's not the time to have a hole in your lineup at tight end, but if you do, we're here to help with our Week 14 fantasy TE PPR rankings.

Fortunately, there are several solid sleepers and streaming options despite two tough byes and some big injuries to notable TEs. It's always tough to know who to trust at this volatile position, so we break down which tight ends have higher floors for those favored to win comfortably and which have higher ceilings for those who need to really shoot for big points.

Let's get to it and check out the TE landscape for Week 14.

Who are the TEs on bye in Week 14?

Few would've expected Week 14's two-team bye to be as problematic as it is, but losing Logan Thomas and Trey McBride this late in the season could have some fantasy owners scrambling.

WEEK 14 PPR RANKINGS:

QBs | RBs | WRs | D/STs | Kickers

Fortunately, both the Commanders and Cardinals have above-average TE defenses, so taking those off the board only helps the position this week.

WEEK 14 STANDARD RANKINGS:

QBs | RBs | WRs | TEs | D/STs | Kickers

Who are the best fantasy TEs in Week 14?

As usual, Travis Kelce (vs. Bills in Week 14) tops our rankings, but T.J. Hockenson (@ Raiders), Sam LaPorta (@ Bears), David Njoku (vs. Jaguars), and Dalton Kincaid (@ Chiefs) aren't far behind. LaPorta and Njoku both have great matchups against defenses that entered last week in the top 10 in fantasy points per game (FPPG) allowed to TEs, and we know what Kelce, Hockenson, and Kincaid do every week in PPR formats.

George Kittle (vs. Seahawks) doesn't have a great matchup -- especially when you remember that he had just three catches for 19 yards against Seattle in Week 12 -- but he remains a must-start given his high ceiling in any matchup.

WEEK 14 FANTASY ADVICE:

Sleepers | Busts | Projections | Start-sit

Who are the best fantasy TE sleepers, pickups, & streamers in Week 14?

It can be tough to trust Taysom Hill (vs. Panthers) in full-point PPR leagues, but a matchup against the league's second-worst run defense gives him a high ceiling regardless of format. He's been more involved as a receiver this year, so he'll get a few catches to go along with the rushing stats, too. With Derek Carr (concussion) banged up, Hill might throw more this week, too.

Gerald Everett (vs. Broncos) and Isaiah Likely (vs. Rams) have matchups against bottom-six TE defenses, and Cole Kmet (vs. Lions), Jake Ferguson (vs. Eagles), and Kyle Pitts (vs. Buccaneers) also have above-average matchups that give them higher floors and higher ceilings than usual.

For those in deeper leagues, Tyler Conklin (vs. Texans), and Cade Otton (@ Falcons) both have matchups against defenses that entered last week in the top five for FPPG allowed to TEs. Brevin Jordan (@ Jets) and Tanner Hudson (vs. Colts) also have highly favorable matchups and can work as deep-league PPR plays, though Jordan's outlook is entirely dependent on whether Dalton Schultz (hamstring) is healthy.

WEEK 14 DFS:

DK lineup | FD lineup | Best values | Best stacks

Who are the biggest potential fantasy TE busts in Week 14?

Dallas Goedert (@ Cowboys) isn't a ""must-start"" if he returns from his forearm injury this week. That said, he's also not a ""must-sit."" He had three catches and 50 yards against Dallas in Week 9 before exiting early with the forearm injury, so he can clearly produce against this defense. Still, it's smart to check your other options before trusting Goedert.

The same goes for Evan Engram (@ Browns). He's generally more reliable in PPR leagues, but he's facing a Browns' defense that allows the fewest FPPG to TEs. Both Engram and Pat Freiermuth (vs. Patriots) are in tough spots against top-five TE defenses.

What are the biggest TE injuries in Week 14?

We already mentioned Goedert (forearm) and Schultz (hamstring), but another TE who could be back this week is Darren Waller (hamstring). The Giants really have no reason to bring back their star TE if they don't feel like he's 100 percent, but it's something to monitor throughout the week, as Waller (vs. Packers) always has a high ceiling as the Giants' de facto No. 1 receiver.

Tyler Higbee (neck) was banged up last week, and he's no sure thing to suit up this week against Baltimore. Even if he does, he's not a recommended play against the Ravens' top-10 TE defense.

We'll be updating these TE PPR rankings throughout the week, so check back for the latest player movement and analysis.

sports,Nick Musial,2023-12-07T22:06:00+00:00,"Alas, we've reached the final week of the fantasy football regular season. Although fantasy's highest-scoring position has been beaten and battered this year, there are serviceable signal-callers out there capable of leading your team to victory in a pivotal week. Our Week 14 fantasy QB rankings will help you make the right start 'em, sit 'em moves to cap off the regular season.

We're still dealing with byes -- and we had two more QB injuries last week -- but the position remains deep with high-scoring studs and potential sleepers. As we saw last week, we're at the point in the season where weather could factor into start-sit decisions, but finding quarterback production shouldn't be a problem in 10- and 12-team leagues.

With that in mind, let's dissect this week's QB rankings and put you on a path to end your season with a ""W.""

Which QBs are on bye in Week 14?

Coinciding with the end of the fantasy regular season, Week 14 is the last week of byes, as the Cardinals and Commanders are the last two teams to take their mandatory PTO. That means two starting-caliber QBs (Kyler Murray and Sam Howell) are on the shelf, slightly impacting the QB pool.

WEEK 14 PPR RANKINGS:

RBs | WRs | TEs | D/STs | Kickers

The bigger losses, though, come on the defensive side of the ball, as fantasy owners won't be able to start QBs going up against two subpar pass defenses in Washington and Arizona. Starting any QB facing the Commanders' swiss-cheese defense has yielded strong returns. Arizona has been just as inefficient, entering Week 13 ranking 30th in dropback EPA.

WEEK 14 STANDARD RANKINGS:

RBs | WRs | TEs | D/STs | Kickers

Who are the best fantasy QBs in Week 14?

Despite Buffalo being on the outside looking in for a playoff berth, Josh Allen (@ Chiefs in Week 14) has come through in fantasy, sitting as our QB1 for Week 14. Yes, the Chiefs' defense has done its part in keeping QBs in check this season, entering Week 13 allowing the fifth-fewest fantasy points per game (FPPG) to the position, but Allen has performed well against Steve Spagnuolo's defense in the past. He's averaging 276.4 passing yards per game with a strong 14:2 TD-to-INT ratio over five career games against KC.

Not far behind sits Tua Tagovailoa (vs. Titans), who shredded the Commanders' defense to the tune of 280 yards and two TDs in Sunday's blowout. Another juicy matchup awaits against a lackluster Tennessee coverage unit. Dak Prescott (vs. Eagles) remains a top-three play in Sunday's rematch versus the Eagles, a team he torched for 374 yards and three TDs in a narrow 28-23 loss in Week 9.

Jalen Hurts (@ Cowboys) and the Eagles look to get back on track in a pivotal NFC East clash in Dallas, facing a Cowboys defense that let Geno Smith post top-end QB1 numbers against them last week. Patrick Mahomes (vs. Bills) is in line to put up strong numbers in a potential shootout against Buffalo, and although his receiving corps has its issues, the reigning MVP is still a top-five play this week.

Lamar Jackson (vs. Rams) faces an exploitable L.A. secondary, while Jared Goff (@ Bears) looks to build off a dominant Week 13 effort against an ascending Chicago stop unit. C.J. Stroud (@ Jets) sees a slight dip in his Week 14 ranking in a tough road test against the Jets, but the Rookie of the Year frontrunner still profiles as a set-it-and-forget-it QB1.

Who are the best fantasy QB sleepers, waiver pickups in Week 14?

Week 14 is a challenging one from streaming perspective, as Gardner Minshew (@ Bengals), Jameis Winston (vs. Panthers), Baker Mayfield (@ Falcons), and Joe Flacco (@ Jaguars) look like the best options.

Minshew is executing Shane Steichen's scheme at an efficient clip and now faces a Cincinnati stop unit that ranks below the league average in dropback EPA. Assuming Winston gets the starting nod in place of the banged-up Derek Carr (head, shoulder, back), his gunslinger play style could lead to a respectable fantasy output against the reeling Panthers.

Mayfield wasn't asked to do much with his arm in Week 13, but a potential negative game script in Atlanta could force him to air the ball out at a higher clip, boosting his fantasy prospects. Although the Browns didn't get the win in Flacco's first start with his new team, the veteran did everything he could to keep Cleveland within striking distance, racking up 254 yards and two TDs. Another 250-plus yard, multi-TD effort could again be in store if he continues to start in place of Dorian Thompson-Robinson (concussion).

WEEK 14 FANTASY ADVICE:

Sleepers | Busts | Projections | Start-sit

Who are the biggest potential QB busts in Week 14?

Matthew Stafford (@ Ravens), Geno Smith (@ 49ers), and Josh Dobbs (@ Raiders) are all risky against some of the league's better pass defenses. Stafford faces a sound Ravens stop unit that entered their Week 13 bye allowing the second-fewest FPPG to QBs.

There's a chance the Vikings opt to start fellow QB Nick Mullens over Dobbs after his debacle last Monday night against the Bears, but if Minnesota elects to stick with Dobbs, his rocky Week 12 outing concerns us against a Raiders defense that's been one of the more efficient pass defenses since Week 5, sitting eighth in dropback EPA.

On the other hand, after an elite Week 13 effort in Seattle's one-possession loss to Dallas, fantasy owners might go looking to chase points with Smith, but replicating last week's showing against the 49ers is a completely different ask for a QB who's underwhelmed this season.

What are the biggest QB injuries in Week 14?

Leading into Week 13, Dorian Thompson-Robinson (concussion) was the lone QB injury situation we were closely monitoring. Even if Thompson-Robinson is able to clear concussion protocol in time for Week 14, we expect Flacco to make his second start as a Brown.

This week, we unfortunately saw Kenny Pickett (ankle) and Derek Carr (head, shoulder, back) exit their respective contests with injuries, complicating their statuses for Week 14. We've replaced both QBs with backups Mitchell Trubisky and Jameis Winston, respectively, as early indications point toward both missing time.

UPDATE: Trevor Lawrence suffered an ankle injury on Monday, which will likely keep him out for at least a week and open the door for C.J. Beathard (vs. Browns) to start.

We'll be updating these QB rankings throughout the week, so check back for the latest player movement and analysis.

sports,Sam Eggleston,2023-11-01T22:08:31+00:00,"In sports betting, betting on totals is a favorite option alongside point spreads and moneylines.

Rather than pick the winner or the winning margin, with totals betting (a.k.a. over/unders), you predict the game’s combined score.

In the sections below, we'll explain totals betting completely incluidng its main attributes, over/under examples from multiple sports, and some totals betting pointers for both novice and seasoned bettors.

What is an over/under bet?

A totals bet, commonly known as an over/under bet, involves betting on the combined score of both teams in a game.

Bookmakers set a predicted total score for the game, and bettors choose whether they think the actual combined score will surpass (over) or fall short of (under) that number.

For instance, if an NBA betting site sets the total for a basketball game at 210.5 points, those who bet the ""over"" would win if the combined score of the two teams is 211 or more.

Those who bet the ""under"" would win if the score totals 210 or less. The 0.5 ensures no chance of a tie, as teams can't score in half-points.

Your only concern is whether the final combined score will fall over or under the line set by oddsmakers.

How do over/under odds work?

When placing totals wagers, you’ll see odds listed alongside the over/under number. These odds indicate the potential payout for the bet.

Typically, the odds for totals bets are close to even, ranging from -105 to -120.

This narrow range reflects the bookmakers' belief that the event has a roughly even chance of going either way, with neither the over nor the under being heavily favored.

Does the totals line move or change?

Yes, the totals line can move. The line movement occurs in response to various factors:

Betting Activity: One of the most common reasons for line movement is a significant amount of money being wagered on one side (either over or under). Bookmakers adjust the line to balance the action and protect themselves from potential losses.

Bookmakers adjust the line to balance the action and protect themselves from potential losses. Injury Updates: If a key player is injured or unable to play, this can influence the expected total score, leading bookmakers to adjust the line accordingly.

Weather Conditions: In outdoor sports, weather can play a significant role. For example, heavy rain or snow in a football game might lead to expectations of a lower-scoring game, causing the line to move down.

Other News and Updates: Any news that might affect the performance of the teams, such as changes in team strategy or recent performances, can influence totals lines.

Totals betting outcomes

When placing an over/under wager, there are a few potential outcomes to consider. If the combined score exceeds the set total, the ""over"" bet wins.

Conversely, if the score is below the set total, the ""under"" bet wins. If the combined score of the game matches the total, the bet is typically considered a ""push,"" and the wager is refunded.

Now, let’s break down those three scenarios.

Totals win

Imagine the NBA over/under odds for a game between the Los Angeles Lakers and the Boston Celtics is 220.5 points. If a bettor believes that the game will be high-scoring and that the teams' combined score will exceed this mark, they might place an ""over"" bet.

The game then unfolds, and the Lakers score 115 points while the Celtics score 110, resulting in a combined score of 225 points. Since 225 exceeds the set total of 220.5, the bettor who wagered on the ""over"" wins their bet.

Totals loss

Suppose a top sports betting app sets a total of 200.5 points for an NBA game between the New York Knicks and the Chicago Bulls.

If a bettor believes the game will be defensive and low-scoring, they might place an ""under"" bet, predicting that the combined score of both teams will be 200 points or less.

However, if the game turns out to be offensively charged and the Knicks score 105 points while the Bulls score 100 points, the combined score becomes 205 points. Since 205 exceeds the set total of 200.5, the bettor who wagered on the ""under"" loses their bet.

Push

A push occurs when the combined score of a game matches the set total established by the bookmaker, meaning that bettors neither win nor lose, and their original wager is refunded. However, to avoid this outcome, most sportsbooks employ half-points in their totals.

By using half points, such as setting a total at 200.5 instead of 200, the sports betting sites ensure that a game's combined score cannot possibly match the set total exactly.

Totals betting by sport

Over/under betting is a major draw across many popular sports. Let’s break down how it can look across sports.

Over/under odds in football

Let's consider some NFL over/under odds between the Dallas Cowboys and the Philadelphia Eagles.

The bookmaker sets the over/under total at 47.5 points for the combined score of both teams. A bettor believes it will be a high-scoring game and places an ""over"" bet.

The game concludes with the Cowboys scoring 28 points and the Eagles scoring 24 points, leading to a combined score of 52 points. Since 52 exceeds the set total of 47.5, the bettor who wagered on the ""over"" wins their bet.

Over/under odds in basketball

Imagine NBA over/under odds between the Charlotte Hornets and the Houston Rockets. The bookmaker sets the over/under total at 215.5 points for the combined score of both teams. A bettor, expecting a defensive showdown, places an ""under"" bet.

The game ends with the Hornets scoring 105 points and the Rockets scoring 108 points, yielding a combined score of 213 points. Since 213 is below the set total of 215.5, the bettor who wagered on the ""under"" successfully wins their bet.

Over/under odds in baseball

Let's look at MLB over/under odds between the New York Yankees and the Boston Red Sox. The bookmaker establishes the over/under total at 8.5 runs for the combined score of both teams.

A bettor, thinking it'll be an offensively charged game with both teams having their best hitters in the lineup, places an ""over"" bet. The game wraps up with the Yankees scoring 5 runs and the Red Sox tallying up 6 runs, resulting in a combined score of 11 runs.

Since 11 exceeds the set total of 8.5, the bettor who wagered on the ""over"" comes out on top.

Over/under odds in hockey

Let's consider NHL over/under odds between the Toronto Maple Leafs and the Montreal Canadiens.

The bookmaker sets the over/under total at 5.5 goals for the combined score of both teams. A bettor, anticipating a game dominated by goalkeepers and defense, places an ""under"" bet.

The game ends with the Maple Leafs netting 3 goals and the Canadiens scoring 2, leading to a combined score of 5 goals. Since 5 is below the set total of 5.5, the bettor who opted for the ""under"" secures a win on their wager.

Over/under odds in soccer

Let's take some Premier League soccer odds between Manchester United and Chelsea. The bookmaker determines the over/under total at 2.5 goals for the combined score of both teams. A bettor, feeling that both teams have been on a scoring spree lately, places an ""over"" bet.

The match ends with Manchester United scoring 2 goals and Chelsea netting 2 as well, resulting in a combined score of 4 goals. Since 4 surpasses the set total of 2.5, the bettor who wagered on the ""over"" enjoys a winning bet.

Over/under odds in MMA

In an MMA context, over/under bets often refer to the duration of the fight rather than points or scores. Let's consider a UFC bout between Fighter A and Fighter B. The bookmaker sets an over/under line at 2.5 rounds for the fight's duration.

A bettor, believing that both fighters have aggressive styles and the fight will conclude early, places an ""under"" bet. If the fight ends midway through the second round due to a knockout or submission, the total rounds would be 1.5.

Since this is below the set total of 2.5 rounds, the bettor who wagered on the ""under"" wins their bet. Conversely, if the fight extends beyond the midway point of the third round, ""over"" bets would win.

Over/under odds in tennis

At tennis betting sites, over/under betting typically revolves around the total number of games or sets played in a match. Let's consider a Grand Slam match between Player A and Player B. The bookmaker sets the over/under total at 40.5 games for the entire match.

A bettor, anticipating a closely contested match with many extended sets, places an ""over"" bet. The match unfolds with the following set scores: 7-5, 6-7, 7-6, and 6-4. The combined total number of games played is 42. Since 42 exceeds the set total of 40.5, the bettor who wagered on the ""over"" wins their bet.

Over/under odds in golf

At golf betting sites, over/under betting often pertains to a golfer's score for a specific round or the entire tournament relative to par. Let's consider a major tournament where a notable golfer, say Rory McIlroy, is playing. The bookmaker sets an over/under line at 69.5 strokes for his first-round score.

A bettor, analyzing the challenging course conditions and believing McIlroy might face difficulties, places an ""under"" bet, predicting he'll finish the round in 69 strokes or fewer.

If McIlroy concludes the round with a score of 68, which is 3 under par on a par-71 course, the bettor's ""under"" wager wins. Conversely, if McIlroy shoots a 70 or higher, those who bet the ""over"" would win.

Totals betting FAQ

How do over/under bets work?

Over/under bets, also known as totals bets, involve wagering on whether a particular number (like combined points scored in a game, total rounds in a fight, or total games in a tennis match) will be over or under the figure set by the bookmaker.

Does overtime count in totals wagering?

Yes, in most sports and with the majority of sportsbooks, overtime does count toward your totals wager. Always check the specific rules of the sportsbook you are betting with to confirm, but generally, overtime is included in totals wagers.

Why does the over/under betting line change?

Sportsbooks set game totals considering factors like recent performances, weather, and player status. As new data emerges and betting trends develop, this line can shift.

For instance, if many bettors choose the ""over,"" the sportsbook might raise the total to balance the bets. Line movements often reflect public betting sentiments and offer insights to informed bettors. Therefore, bettors must monitor any line changes before the game starts and strategize accordingly to optimize their betting success.

Is it better to bet over or under?

Neither wager holds a universal advantage. Success in over/under betting hinges on a thorough evaluation of both the set line and the competing teams.

How do you read an over/under bet?

Reading a total bet involves understanding the combined score set by the sportsbook and the odds associated with that number. When you see a total, such as 210.5 in a basketball game, it represents the combined score anticipated from both teams. Beside this number, you'll typically find ""over"" and ""under"" options.

If you believe the actual combined score will surpass this number, you'd bet on the ""over."" Conversely, if you think it will be less, you'd choose the ""under."" Accompanying these options are odds that indicate the payout for the bet.

For instance, odds of -110 (extremely common) mean you'd need to wager $110 to win an additional $100. Evaluating both the total and the associated odds is crucial for informed betting decisions.

sports,News,2023-12-23T23:03:15+00:00,"Jai Opetaia has taken his frustrations out on a hapless Ellis Zorro, the unbeaten Australian delivering a brutal first-round knockout in Saudi Arabia, while Kiwi heavyweight Joseph Parker stunned former champ Deontay Wilder to ruin his chances of facing Anthony Joshua.

Cruiserweight Opetaia was forced to vacate his IBF world title belt to take his place on the mega-card in Riyadh early on Sunday morning (AEDT).

In a bout reportedly worth $680,000 to the Australian, he wasted little time, a huge left hand obliterating Zorro with four seconds remaining in the first round.

Facebook Twitter Whatsapp Reddit Email Share

The punch sent the dazed Englishman into the ropes and on to the canvas, the outclassed Zorro eventually able to offer a sheepish smile in what was his first loss in 18 professional fights.

The former Olympian moved to 24-0 with 19 stoppages and retained his Ring Magazine belt to cap a week of drama that saw Opetaia stripped of his IBF status in controversial circumstances.

“I train for 12 rounds, was prepared for 12 and if the knockout comes, it comes,” Opetaia said.

“He was a bit too hesitant and he got clipped, that’s the way it goes.”

Commentator Sergio Mora described the one-punch knockout as “devastating and scary” while fellow pundit Mike Costello added: “At any weight, at any level that’s as clinical as it gets in this sport”.

“He dismissed Zorro with the minimum of fuss and the maximum of power,” he added.

Opetaia broke his jaw twice on the way to upsetting Mairis Briedis to win the IBF and Ring belts last year before enduring a frustrating wait to defend them 14 months later.

Multiple opponents have dodged the 28-year-old, who the IBF demanded fight Briedis next despite the injured Latvian being happy to delay their bout until he is fit early next year.

“I did, but look at this place, beautiful, I’m happy to be here,” Opetaia said when asked if he had vented his frustrations in the ring.

“I’m pumped; first round knockout, I’m ready for the next fight.

“The last 18 months is just part of the journey. I’m here in the ring now and that’s all that matters.

“These dudes (promoters) put the people in front of me and I just knock them out.”

Opetaia’s next fight could be on the Tyson Fury-Oleksandr Usyk card in Riyadh on February 17.

Promoter Eddie Hearn said the Australian had the potential to replicate Usyk’s career and unify the cruiserweight division before moving up to the heavyweights.

“Every fight man knows,” Hearn said of the man regarded as the No.1 cruiserweight in the world.

“I believe Jai’s going to do the exact same thing (as Usyk) … we’re talking about a pound-for-pound talent,” Hearn said.

Dubbed the ‘Day of Reckoning’, the Middle East card features heavyweight stars Joshua, Wilder, Parker and light heavyweight champion Dimitri Bivol.

Parker’s victory over Wilder came before Joshua stopped Otto Wallin with a fifth-round TKO in a heavyweight double-header.

The bouts at Kingdom Arena in Riyadh were expected to set up a March bout between Wilder and Joshua.

Instead, it appears Parker is in a position to step up in March, with the winner of that fight hoping to get a shot at the undisputed championship, which will be decided on February 17 when Tyson Fury and Oleksandr Usyk meet in Saudi Arabia.

The heavyweight division hasn’t been unified this century.

The 31-year-old Parker, a big underdog according to FanDuel Sportsbook, looked the better fighter throughout, while the 38-year-old Wilder looked his age in a match-up of former heavyweight champions.

Parker (34-3-0) dominated from the start, landing powerful punches with his right hand while keeping Wilder on his heels with a smart and methodical approach.

“Dangerous fight, tough fight, we trained very hard for this,” Parker said.

“We had great momentum coming into this fight. The strategy was to stay calm, stay relaxed, stay focused … every minute of every round. This is a great finish to the year.”

There was only one round in which Wilder got the better of Parker.

“My timing was off a little bit,” Wilder said.

“He did a great job of avoiding a lot of my punches. I did feel like I had the upper hand, but things happen. We move on to the next step.”

In the main event, Wallin’s corner called for the stoppage at the end of the fifth round.

Joshua, a strong favourite, needed more than just a victory to convince sceptics his best days weren’t behind him.

The British boxer earned some style points against the 33-year-old Wallin, who is from Sweden.

Joshua (27-3-0) hadn’t looked the same since holding the WBA, IBF and WBO titles. But the 34-year-old delivered a throwback performance, jabbing and moving forward with confidence while backing down Wallin (26-2-0).

Advertisement

A strong right-left combination in the fifth round eventually led to the stoppage.

“Just another fight. I respect Otto,” Joshua said.

“Not so much a throwback, just another day in the office. I’m just a gifted fighter that has a special gift and I use it to the best of my ability.

“We just want to do whatever it takes to be victorious. All I want to be is just be victorious for as long as I can. I’m searching for greatness.”

Earlier, Dmitrii Bivol defeated Lyndon Arthur in a unanimous decision that saw all three judges score it a 12-round sweep for the IBO light heavyweight and WBA super light heavyweight belts.

The early card also included five knockouts.

After Opetaia, Daniel Dubois (20-2-0) registered a 10th-round TKO of Jarrell Miller (26-1-1) with eight seconds left in the final round.

Agit Kabayel (24-0-0) scored a fourth-round TKO of Arslanbek Makhmudov (18-1-0) in a scheduled 10-round heavyweight bout.

Filip Hrgovic (17-0-0) stopped Mark De Mori (41-3-2) with a first-round TKO, and Frank Sanchez (24-0-0) opened the night with a seventh-round knockout of Junior Fa (20-3-0).

sports,Emily Dozier,2023-10-07T21:21:03+00:00,"Colorado fans, you're back. For now.

A 43-yard pass from Shedeur Sanders on the Buffaloes' final drive helped set up Alejandro Mata for the game-winning 43-yard field goal with 12 seconds left, delivering Colorado the 27-24 win over Arizona State for their first Pac-12 win of the season. It snaps their eight-game conference losing streak.

Sanders had a mediocre day by his lofty standards, but his 239 yards and a touchdown were enough in perhaps Colorado's most crucial game so far. It brought the team to 4-2, but had it lost, it would have been much harder for the Buffs to finish the season bowl eligible. A win gives them a leg up in a competitive conference, particularly facing four ranked teams down the stretch of the season.

If Colorado wants to solidify a bowl game, it'll have to fix many things, one of them being the offensive line. It allowed five sacks on Sanders, bringing the season total to a nation-leading 31. The defense picked up five sacks themselves to maintain pressure on Trenton Bourguet.

For Arizona State, Bourguet put all he could into Saturday's narrow loss. He's one of two healthy quarterbacks on the roster, and passed for 335 yards and a touchdown. The Sun Devils had a real shot at their first conference win. But as the game came to a close, Bourguet seemed roughed up and slow, though he did drive the team down the field 94 yards in 13 plays for the game-tying touchdown with 50 seconds left.

Luckily for Arizona State, next week is a bye week. What's not so lucky is that it'll go on to play three ranked teams over the following three weeks.

We didn't see the worst of either team, though we didn't see the best either. Colorado needed a bounce back win and got one. Meanwhile Arizona State kept on struggling, falling to 1-5.

sports,,2023-10-28T21:30:00+00:00,"Erik ten Hag has disagreed with Jamie Carragher's comments that Manchester United are going backwards this season - by saying the statistics show that his team has actually improved.

United host local rivals Manchester City in a Super Sunday derby this weekend, live on Sky Sports with kick-off at 3.30pm, in the latest acid test to see how far Ten Hag's side have improved from last season.

In his column in The Daily Telegraph, Carragher said United's summer signings have led to the club becoming ""stale"" - and that Ten Hag should now be questioned about whether he can get the best out of his squad.

But in his pre-match press conference for the City game, Ten Hag hit back at those claims.

""In possession we have to do better, but there are reasons and I don't go into them, but everyone is seeing why. But there are also facts so I disagree [with Carragher], we are much better,"" said Ten Hag.

""In high ball regains, we are a top of the Premier League. In the middle [of the pitch] ball regains, we are top. The pressing is very good. So that's not the truth, what he [Carragher] is telling.""

In a fortnight where United have picked up three straight wins against Brentford, Sheffield United and FC Copenhagen, albeit via far from convincing performances, Christian Eriksen said United still need to find their ""balance and routines"" this season.

Asked about those comments, Ten Hag said: ""We are in the right direction. We have a way to go. I see positives but I see negatives.

""What Christian is referring to is we are not consistently in possession on the level where we can be. Like Arsenal away, the first 30 minutes in Bayern Munich away. We should do this on a consistent basis.

""We don't take the benefit in the attacking transition moments, we should be because the ability in the team can take benefit from it. We pay attention to it, we need to grow. Then games will become easier.""

So, what do the stats say?

Sky Sports' Sam Blitz:

Ten Hag is indeed right - Manchester United do rank very highly in their pressing stats in the final two-thirds of the pitch.

United are, as he says, ""top of the Premier League"" in terms of possessions won in the final third and high turnovers. He is slightly wrong in terms of winning the ball in the middle third of the pitch - with United second behind Everton in that statistical table.

However, there is still work to be done in terms of improving United's pressing. Their passing permitted per defensive actions (PPDA) tally ranks 10th - so, average - in the league. It shows that while Ten Hag's side do win the ball high up the pitch, opponents do tend to keep the ball as well as play it around United's pressing forwards as well.

What is PPDA? PPDA is the number of opposition passes allowed outside of the pressing team's own defensive third, divided by the number of defensive actions by the pressing team outside of their own defensive third. A lower figure indicates a higher level of pressing, while a higher figure indicates a lower level of pressing.

The other pressing concern United have, which Ten Hag did reference in Friday's press conference, is finishing chances when they win the ball high up.

United have the fourth-highest amounts of shots after winning the ball in their final third, but the glaring statistic is no goals from 104 high turnovers.

As expected, Manchester City have the highest amount of build-up attacks in the Premier League this season, so if United do win the ball high up in Sunday's derby, they need to start taking those chances.

Ten Hag on misfiring strikers: We need to be better

Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player Manchester United boss Erik ten Hag speaks on the improvement he's seen in goalkeeper Andre Onana and insists he believes Marcus Rashford can get back to scoring goals

United go into Sunday's derby with a slight striker scoring problem. City forward Erling Haaland has scored more Premier League goals this season (9) than United's five forwards have managed in all competitions (8).

United's top scorer this season is actually defensive midfielder Casemiro with four strikes so far.

Asked if their forwards are to blame for this frontline problem, Ten Hag replied: ""Fault? It's co-operation. It has to click.

""We have shown in some games, we have so many in overload positions to the opponents goal and we don't net or don't even hit the target. We should be doing this better.""

It has been a sobering start to the season for Marcus Rashford, who has one goal so far this term for United. But Ten Hag says he has full faith that the England forward, who scored 30 goals last season, can find his scoring boots again.

""If you give him the trust and I play him every game, most games also he finishes the game. I have strong belief he will return to scoring a lot of goals,"" said Ten Hag.

""It also has to do with the co-operation, with the movement around and the distribution to him. We have to work on that and that's my focus point.""",Ten Hag responds to Carra: Man Utd have actually improved,https://www.skysports.com/football/news/11095/12994089/man-utd-vs-man-city-erik-ten-hag-disagrees-with-jamie-carragher-that-his-team-have-gone-backwards-this-season,Sky Sports
sports,Brent Brookhouse,2023-11-11T21:30:46+00:00,"UFC 295 took a hit when heavyweight champion Jon Jones suffered an injury that forced him out of his planned title defense against Stipe Miocic. Despite the loss of the planned main event, the card features some compelling and evenly-matched fights, including a pair of championship bouts on top when the promotion returns to Madison Square Garden in New York.

In the main event, the vacant light heavyweight title is up for grabs when former champion Jiri Prochazka clashes with former middleweight champion Alex Pereira. Prochazka never lost the belt but was forced to vacate due to a shoulder injury. An injury to Jamahal Hill, who won the title after Prochazka vacated, left the belt up for grabs once again, setting up this bout that sees Pereira as a slight -115 favorite.

""I'm not going into this fight with mixed emotions about vengeance. I don't want to play that game,"" Pereira told CBS Sports this week. ""I want to go with a very positive mindset. I'm going to fight with the mindset that they haven't even fought before. But looking into the other side of being able to bring Glover his belt back and put it back in the gym, that means a lot to me.""

The pair of heavyweights set to clash could usher in the new era of the division. Sergei Pavlovich and Tom Aspinall are both vicious finishers with neither man going beyond the six-minute mark of a fight in their UFC careers. Because of their immense power and skills, the fight is a virtual pick'em at the betting window.

Let's take a look at what we've identified as our choices for the best bets on the UFC 295 pay-per-view main card.

CBS Sports will also have live coverage of the fight with round-by-round scoring and blow-by-blow updates to keep you up to date throughout the night.

Diego Lopes vs. Pat Sabatini

Pat Sabatini moneyline (-115)

This is a sticky fight to me. According to the odds, both men are most likely to win by submission, which makes sense given that both have 12 submission victories on their resume. Where it gets tricky is that neither man has a submission loss, so they've both been dominant in applying their grappling. Lopes is a bit more dangerous on his feet but Sabatini has the better wrestling and can probably impose his will to force the fight to the ground. The question is whether either man can trap the other in a submission once Sabatini puts the fight on the floor. The odds suggest the fight won't go the distance (-190) but I'm not so sure this doesn't become a three-round grind on the ground, so we'll go with the slight favorite to score the win on the strength of his wrestling.

Matt Frevola vs. Benoit Saint-Denis

Under 1.5 rounds (-143)

After four of his first five fights in the UFC went to decision, Frevola has not seen the second round in his four most recent bouts. Three of Saint-Denis' five UFC bouts have checked in at under 1.5 rounds. The matchup iis a good mix of fighters looking to find a quick finish. If you want a slightly higher risk, Saint-Denis is +155 to win by KO, TKO or DQ. Frevola has two knockout losses on his ledger, one in an even one minute and the other in just seven seconds. Saint-Denis can finish fights quickly and Frevola has gotten drubbed out of fights fast in the past.

Mackenzie Dern vs. Jessica Andrade

Mackenzie Dern to win by submission (+115)

This is Andrade's fifth fight in 2023. That usually indicates a fighter is on a good run and looking to continue their momentum. Instead, Andrade has lost her three most recent fights, all by stoppage. Dern is an incredibly accomplished submission grappler and won four of her first seven UFC fights by submission. The submissions haven't been coming for Dern as of late, however, with a 2-2 run in her four most recent outings, all going to the judges' scorecards. Andrade has four submission losses in her career, two of which came during her current three-fight skid. This feels like the perfect fight for Dern to get back to basics and dominate on the ground before finishing with a submission.

Sergei Pavlovich vs. Tom Aspinall

Tom Aspinall moneyline (-120)

You have to go all the way back to June 2017 to find a Pavlovich fight that went past the opening round. In fact, only three of his 19 career fights have hit the five-minute mark and he has five wins that came in less than one minute. Not to be outdone, Aspinall has six fights that ended in less than one minute and three that went past the opening round. This all adds up to a wild situation where this interim heavyweight championship fight has +500 odds for the fight ending in the first minute of the fight, the ""favorite"" of the time of finish lines. The fight going past 1.5 rounds is +165, which is somewhat appealing since this is a five-round fight and it would make sense for both men to not dump their entire tank on chasing a quick finish. Still, Aspinall's more diverse game makes his moneyline a slightly more appealing bet.

Jiri Prochazka vs. Alex Pereira

Over 1.5 rounds (-150)

Only three of Prochazka and Pereira's nine UFC fights have ended in under 1.5 rounds. Both men are dynamic and dangerous, with the ability to finish a fight in a flash. Still, both men are also tough as nails and highly skilled. In such an even fight, it's hard to throw a bet at either man straight up or any method of finish unless you feel you have a truly good read on the bout. I don't have that feeling, but I do think the fight happens at a high pace and lasts more than one and a half rounds before either man takes over or gets the finish. Barring someone landing an early bomb, this feels like the best available line for the fight.

Whatever sport these teams will be attempting to play will probably end up setting the sport back 100 years, so much so that even the biggest supporters of defensive battles will be begging for some offense. The NFL probably didn't envision Mitch Trubisky facing off against Bailey Zappe when the schedule was released back in the spring, but sometimes the worst games on paper also bring the biggest profit opportunities. We're once again building a FanDuel DFS lineup so we have something to root for all night long.

Before we break down our picks and strategy, here are the most notable scoring rules for FanDuel contests: four-point passing TDs and half-point PPR.

Patriots-Steelers FanDuel Picks Week 14: NFL DFS lineup for GPP tournaments

$60,000 budget, at least one player from each team required

MVP (1.5x points) RB Ezekiel Elliott, Patriots ($12,000). It doesn't matter whether Bailey Zappe, Mac Jones, Bill Belichick, or Robert Kraft end up taking snaps on Thursday night -- the Patriots' offense will continue to be tough on the eyes. Points will be at a premium between these teams, and controlling the clock is definitely important. That's where Elliott comes in. He's set to start this game with Rhamondre Stevenson (ankle) sidelined for the foreseeable future, meaning New England's offense will be hoping for a vintage performance from the former Cowboy. Expect the RB to be fed a ton. Whether that results in a touchdown remains to be seen, but if anyone is scoring a TD on the Pats roster Thursday night, it's Elliott.

FLEX RB Najee Harris, Steelers ($14,000). Much like the Patriots, this Steelers offense will want to establish the ground game, and that starts with Harris. It wasn't long ago that the RB was the subject of major criticism for looking slow and ineffective, but that narrative has flipped in a big way. With an average of 15 carries per game in the past five, we can expect at least that and maybe more from a Pittsburgh team that is starting Mitch Trubisky on Thursday night. As an added bonus, Harris is also the preferred goal-line back, scoring in three of those games. The Patriots' defense doesn't give up much, making Harris our best bet for success in an old-fashioned defensive struggle between two of the worst offenses the NFL has to offer.

FLEX D/ST Steelers ($10,000). The Steelers can get after the quarterback and force plenty of turnovers in any given game. They're facing an offense that's posted 13 points in the past three weeks -- not exactly encouraging for fantasy purposes. We think there's a good chance of a defensive score here, boosting the outlook for Pittsburgh's D/ST. There will be few yards and even fewer points. Even though the Steelers can be vulnerable against the pass, the Patriots are not a team capable of exploiting that weakness. Don't overthink it.

FLEX D/ST Patriots ($9,000). Much like the Steelers, most of that logic also applies here with the Patriots. Trubisky will have to try to move the ball on a team that hasn't allowed more than 10 points in three straight weeks. We can't envision the Steelers scoring 20 points on offense, leaving us with a low-scoring affair. New England's problem is obviously the offense, so don't overlook the defense that continues to give them chances to win every week.

FLEX K Chris Boswell, Steelers ($8,500). Could we be in for another field goal fest? Last week's contest in New England saw the Chargers kick two FGs en route to a 6-0 victory, so why rule it out here? Pittsburgh is already starting a backup QB and has a tough time scoring against everyone anyway, so it's safe to assume that FGs, not TDs, are on the menu once again.

Her hair billowing in the wind, her skis effortlessly gliding on the glistening ice as if afloat, she is one with the snow and the mountain. This is the essence of Mikaela Shiffrin. In the world of Alpine skiing, Shiffrin has long been a dominant force to be reckoned with.

America’s Favorite Video Today

After all, the legend has made history by achieving the most World Cup wins by any male or female skier ever. With two Olympic golds, an impressive five overall World Cup victories, and four world championship wins, she is the youngest slalom champion in Olympic Alpine skiing history. Her legacy stands tall in the world of sports, but her roots run deep as well. Here’s all you need to know about the skiing legends’ family.

How Mikaela Shiffrin’s parents fell in love through skiing

ADVERTISEMENT Article continues below this ad

Mikaela Shiffrin is the second child of Eileen and Jeff Shiffrin. Eileen had skiing in her blood and grew up with a passion for the sport. When she was a child, her parents would take her and her siblings up Mt. Greylock during the winter, and there, using sickles to cut the meadow grass, they would prepare a slope for their children to ski on. That is where her deep love for the sport took root. However, she had to pause her passion when she started studying at a nursing college. Later, her mother became a nurse, and this noble journey led her to the love of her life. In 1985, fate brought her mother and her father, Jeff, an anesthesiologist who at the time was completing his cardiothoracic rotation, together at St. Elizabeth’s Medical Center in Brighton, Massachusetts. Jeff himself was an avid skier when he was young and would often visit Vermont on the weekend with his family as a child.

Eileen spoke about her love, saying he was “brilliant, jovial, and curious, with a solution to every problem”. Unable to resist her charm, Jeff had asked Eileen out on a date, and he even had to convince her to give their love another chance. That’s when the epic love story began. Young Jeff and Eileen took their first vacation together as a couple and visited the snowy wonderland of Aspen. The snowy trails and scenic winter reignited the passionate old flame in Eileen’s heart for gliding down the soft powdery snow, and she even stated, “If it wasn’t for Jeff, I wouldn’t have kept skiing”. She even stated how Jeff reawakened the love of the sport that had remained in Eileen’s heart over the years.

Growing up with skier parents

In 1986, a year after they first met, the beautiful couple tied the knot. Five years later, realizing the incredible connection they felt to the snowy trails of Aspen, they moved to the world-class skiing city of Vail. A year after moving to Vail, Jeff and Eileen welcomed Taylor, Mikaela’s brother, in 1992. And three years later, Mikaela arrived in 1995. Jeff and Eileen, both avid and passionate skiers from a tender age, introduced their children to their passion and the world of skiing. The couple would take little Mikaela and Taylor on family outings at Vail and teach the two the art of gliding over the snow. Later, when Taylor was 9 and Mikaela was 7, their parents enrolled them in Ski Club Vail.

According to Aspen Sojourner, SCV’s Rika Moore began to coach the kids, and soon the two rapidly began to progress. When most coaches would not even let other kids try the slalom gates, Mikaela, on the other hand, cleared the slalom gates with her sheer talent. Later, the family moved to New England due to Jeff’s career, and the kids found their safe space at the Burke Mountain Academy.

The family moved to Vail in 2009, but Mikaela went back to Burke, and her mother decided to move with her and help her by home-schooling her while monitoring her training. Over the years, the fire and sheer talent within Mikaela couldn’t be tamed. She even won the prestigious Topolino races in Italy, sweeping most of the wins when she was 14. Her parents tried their best to keep the soaring youngling grounded.

Her dad’s rules for her were, “Be nice. Think first. Have fun,” which Shiffrin has affixed to the back of her helmet. Taylor, too, made immense progress and went on to win two NCAA team titles with the University of Denver. Later in 2011, Eileen became Mikaela’s full-time traveling companion and would also handle her schoolwork, while Jeff began to handle the logistics and would use his PTO to visit them with Taylor. The passion for the sport that had reignited in the relationship of Jeff and Eileen saw its fruition in their history-making daughter, Mikaela Shiffrin.

A tragic time for the family

Over the years, Jeff saw his daughter win one downhill, one super-G, and place fourth in a second downhill. She was at the pinnacle of her career, with her sights set on the fourth consecutive overall title. After spending some much-needed family time together in the resort town of Lake Garda, Italy, after the Bansko races, the family said goodbye to each other and made a promise to see each other in five weeks. However Two days later, while Mikaela was training in Italy, she received a concerned call from her brother Taylor asking to speak urgently with their mom. Taylor told the two how Jeff had fallen and that they needed to return home immediately.

Jeff had sustained a head injury due to an accidental fall. The family spent Jeff’s last days together by his side as a family before he passed away on February 2, 2020. This shattered the family and left a huge void in their hearts. The pain of the loss was gut-wrenching for Eileen, who said, “We learned quickly that people have their crosses to bear, and they aren’t everyone else’s crosses; they’re the ones we have to bear ourselves. You learn to suffer in silence”.

How Mikaela Shiffrin recovered from the devastation

For Mikaela Shiffrin, this devastating loss broke her heart. She even said she was left questioning how she could ever ski again. Mikaela stated that skiing was “the place where I feel most connected to him. It’s kind of hard to feel that anywhere else”. She even shared that she was in the middle of a sports-illustrated photoshoot when her dad had the accident.

This left her feeling immense pain every time she would see her pictures from the shoot. Without her anchor, the grief would be so immense that she couldn’t even get out of bed, said her mother. Eileen even stated, “She was so devastated. She couldn’t stop crying”.

However, Taylor, unable to see his sister reeling from the pain one day, suddenly walked over to his mom and Mikaela and told her “You can’t quit on us”. He spoke in an interview, calling the moment his moment of “selfishness,” and said, It’s what his dad would also want and how he would’ve handled the situation.

He said his dad would use the phrase he often used when they were children, which was “When you’re going through hell, keep going. Don’t stop”. After a lengthy period of absence from the sport, she returned in 2021 for the first of the two slalom races at Levi.

In 2022, when she set the record for the most World Cup wins in Alpine skiing history, she honored her dad by writing on Instagram, “Thank you. Dad, I hope you had a good view. Mom, your strength, love, support, and belief in me is the greatest treasure I’ll ever know”.

Presented with a chance to test themselves against a world-class opponent on home soil, the U.S. entered the break level as a Christian Pulisic stunner was cancelled out by Ilkay Gundogan's poaching.

Yet after halftime, as Gio Reyna was withdrawn from his first start back under Gregg Berhalter to build his fitness, the U.S. midfield was overrun and the defense committed a multitude of errors to allow the Germans to gain full control of proceedings.

""It’s frustrating because its just little moments,"" said U.S. goalkeeper Matt Turner after the match. ""Little moments made a big difference at the World Cup, and it’s kinda the same story here.”

The Sporting News reviews how each USMNT player performed across the 90 minutes.

USA player ratings vs Germany

USA starting lineup (4-3-3, right to left): 1. Turner (GK) — 19. Scally, 4. Richards (Carter-Vickers, 66'), 13. Ream, 2. Dest — 7. Reyna (de la Torre, 46'), 6. Musah, 8. McKennie (Cardoso, 75') — 21. Weah (Aaronson, 66'), 20. Balogun (Pepi, 66'), 10. Pulisic (Paredes, 75').

GK: Matt Turner — 8

The only goal Matt Turner conceded in the first half came on a play Turner initially saved, before being slammed home by Ilkay Gundogan as the rest of the U.S. defense just stood there and watched.

Turner made a host of excellent saves, and while Germany certainly didn't dazzle in the finishing department, he was a critical part of the U.S. performance as the defense melted in front of him. The second half was overwhelming for the U.S. back line, and Turner had little answer for the waves of pressure, but he still made a number of good stops, particularly just after the break with the game still level.

A quality performance from the U.S. goalkeeper, although he could have done better to help marshal a totally scattered defensive line.

Matt Turner says no ❌

RB: Joe Scally — 6

Joe Scally was tidy in possession, and while he offered very little in the attack, that was largely by design as they didn't need him on that right side with Tim Weah cooking.

Scally defended ok, and wasn't guilty of any big mistakes, which is more than most of the other U.S. defenders can say. It wasn't a standout performance by any means, and the whole back line has some soul searching to do, but others were far more culpable than the Borussia Monchengladbach man.

CB: Chris Richards — 4

Statistically, Chris Richards had a pretty good match, missing with just one pass of his 42 attempted and not being beaten at any point by any German attackers. Yet his lack of volume speaks... well, volumes.

Richards was off the pace for much of his 65 minutes, and failed to get involved as his teammates were beaten repeatedly on the dribble. It was Richards' positioning that let him down, and he should have been more involved with the U.S. under siege in such an open match.

CB: Tim Ream — 5

Chris Richards often left Tim Ream on an island, and the 36-year-old just could not cope with the waves of German attackers.

The third German goal was emblematic of this lack of chemistry between the two U.S. center-backs: Richards stepped up to guard a free Niklas Fullkrug who got by Sergino Dest, and Ream was unaware as that left Leroy Sane free on goal himself. These two just didn't have it, and Ream was powerless to pick up the slack.

LB: Sergino Dest — 4

If it were possible to give Sergino Dest two different scores, one for the attacking half and one for the defensive half, we'd do it, but that's not how this works. Dest was lively up front as he combined with Christian Pulisic and worked very well on the ball. He got Mats Hummels booked on a counter-attack and delivered a few very quality crosses.

Dest was also guilty of some of the game's worst defensive errors. He was completely non-existent as Leroy Sane blazed by him on the first Germany goal, and he nearly got his team in trouble again right before halftime by holding onto the ball too long after making an interception rather than just clearing it out of danger. Filling in for Antonee Robinson at left-back rather than his natural right, Germany targeted him on multiple occasions, to great profit.

He had a few good moments guarding Leroy Sane in the second half, but he was a top culprit for Germany's second goal by playing Niklas Fullkrug onside. If the U.S. had profited more from his attacking presence the narrative around his performance might be different, but with the story of the match focused on the defensive errors, Dest is a guilty party.

CM: Yunus Musah — 6

Another player who did well in possession but struggled defensively, Yunus Musah dazzled at times on the ball but was beaten on the first Germany goal by whiffing with his slide.

Musah's nutmeg of Florian Wirtz was a highlight moment of the match, and he was active on both ends of the pitch. Yet a few bad giveaways or defensive moments betrayed his usual stoutness in the middle of the pitch. Overall, the mistakes didn't take away from his performance quite as much as Dest's, but they were still concerning.

CM: Weston McKennie — 4

Other than a pair of critical blocks right before halftime, Weston McKennie was a mess through the first 45 minutes. He was constantly unsure of where he should be as Germany built forward with incisive pace, and he was one of many U.S. players caught unaware on the first-half Ilkay Gundogan goal.

McKennie didn't put a first-half pass wrong, going 18/18 before the break and 28/30 overall, but his positioning was all wrong out of possession. McKennie was a sieve as the U.S. midfield was invisible defensively, leaving their defenders completely unshielded, particularly at the top of the penalty area.

It was only a matter of time before the floodgates opened, and that they did after halftime. McKennie was eventually withdrawn in what felt like one of Gregg Berhalter's only tactical substitutions of the match.

CM: Gio Reyna — 7

In his first 45 minutes of international football under Gregg Berhalter since the World Cup fallout, Gio Reyna was his usual self, drawing the attention of German defenders and proving visionary with his passing. He combined with Folarin Balogun on a number of occasions on the counter, which is a link-up that U.S. fans have been begging for more of.

Reyna was only fit for 45 minutes of play here as he returns from a leg injury, but it's no coincidence that Germany truly secured midfield dominance when he came off the field. A promising performance for the young playmaker who should head back to Borussia Dortmund after this international break with plenty of confidence moving forward.

RW: Tim Weah — 8

Though Germany carved the U.S. defense to pieces, their attacking threat remained strong, and almost all the danger came from the wings. While Christian Pulisic starred on the left, Tim Weah was equally devastating down the right, dazzling with electric pace and good link-up.

Weah's biggest moment came when he scorched Robin Gosens on the wing in the first half, knocking it past the German defender and then beating him with blistering speed to get back on the ball. Weah's statistical haul don't quite do him justice, but he was a threat throughout his 66 minutes of action.

ST: Folarin Balogun — 7

U.S. fans are salivating for Folarin Balogun to get more touches up front, and as Gregg Berhalter foreshadowed pre-match, they made a clear attempt to do that. Gio Reyna and Tim Weah did the most of the work in that regard,

LW: Christian Pulisic — 9

There's no doubting who remains the most electric and incisive U.S. player is, as Christian Pulisic once again backed up his nickname of 'Captain America'. The first half stunner was emblematic of his performance, but beyond that he constantly proved a threat to German's out-of-position right-back Jonathan Tah.

Pulisic completed 27 of 29 passes, a tidy haul for a player of his attacking intent, and created two chances in addition to getting the goal. His corners remain awful, and it's a wonder why he is still on duty for that role, but otherwise Pulisic was a menace.

Christian Pulisic with an absolute banger 🚀

Player ratings for USMNT substitutes vs Germany

45th min: Luca de la Torre — 5

Brought on to replace Gio Reyna at halftime, Luca de la Torre was unable to stem the German tide, despite being a more defensive-minded option than Reyna in what should have been a swap to shore up the midfield.

65th min: Cameron Carter-Vickers — 7

With Tim Ream and even Chris Richards struggling at various stages in this match, Cameron Carter-Vickers remains a top-tier center-back in this U.S. player pool and a clear starter when healthy. He came off the bench due to his recent hamstring troubles, but was stout in his 25 minutes of action.

The Celtic defender had 22 touches and gave away possession just two times, completing two dribbles and making two clearances. Carter-Vickers was not a target for Germany to attack nearly as much as the other three defenders on the pitch, a strong nod to his abilities.

65th min: Brenden Aaronson — 7

Probably the the U.S. substitute to make the biggest impact, Brenden Aaronson was bright in the attack, dazzling with his dribbling skills and helping usher the U.S. forward amidst a second-half onslaught from Germany. A good showing from the Union Berlin winger who needs confidence at the moment.

65th min: Ricardo Pepi — 5

It wasn't an ideal situation for Ricardo Pepi to enter in, coming on with the U.S. shell-shocked from the quickfire Germany double. Still, he provided very little up front, with just eight touches in 24 minutes of action. He featured his usual pressing, and came close to scoring once on a messy chance that Germany just barely managed to clear, but otherwise he didn't quite cause the opposing back line problems to open spaces up for teammates.

75th min: Johnny Cardoso — 6

Johnny Cardoso only had 15 minutes at the end to showcase his abilities, but it begged the question why he or Lennard Maloney weren't the ones introduced at halftime instead of Luca de la Torre. Cardoso lost possession just once in his 10 touches and completed a tackle, although he was also dribbled past a few times as well.

75th min: Kevin Paredes — 5

With 10 touches in his 15 minutes of action towards the end of a mucked up game of numerous substitutions, Kevin Paredes didn't stand out, losing possession four times and completing four passes. Tough to evaluate his time on the field, but he didn't stand out.","USA vs Germany player ratings: USMNT defensive errors blight positive performance by Pulisic, Weah",https://www.sportingnews.com/us/soccer/news/usa-germany-player-ratings-pulisic-weah-star-usmnt/0718bd5fb2a8b822bf2c9465,Sporting News

Because the award has no set criteria for selection, it can be notoriously difficult to predict which player will walk away with the MVP trophy at the end of the season.

Who are the NBA MVP odds favorites?

Nikola Jokic: Falling short of a third consecutive MVP last season, Jokic steered Denver to its first NBA championship through an impressive playoff showing. During the summer, he emerged as a favored MVP candidate. As the Nuggets maintain their key lineup for another championship bid, Jokic consistently demonstrates his game prowess.

Luka Doncic: Doncic, among the preseason favorites for the past three years, has seen his prospects decline due to the Mavericks' limited support in Dallas, as underscored by their recent playoff absence. Although no one doubts Doncic's skills, questions about the Mavericks' contention capabilities persist.

Giannis Antetokounmpo: Last season, Milwaukee's surprising first-round departure against the Heat was notably influenced by Antetokounmpo's absence for much of the series. The two-time MVP, arguably the league's premier two-way player, is poised to rebound next season. At 28, in his prime, his resolve is stronger than ever following the Bucks' premature playoff exit.

Joel Embiid: Reigning MVP Embiid remains a prominent figure among top contenders. Despite the Sixers' playoff setbacks, he dominated the regular season, leading in scoring and showcasing superior rim defense. If he remains injury-free, Embiid is poised to vie for his MVP status again, hopefully with a strengthened supporting cast.

When should you bet on NBA MVP futures?

You can bet on the regular-season NBA MVP award well before the season starts. But when is the best time? That comes down to your tolerance for risk versus reward.

The odds are so favorable when the lines for NBA Most Valuable Player are first released because the oddsmakers, like you, have very little information to work with.

They are basing their odds on past performance and expected future accomplishments, as well as the quality of the team around the top candidates for the award. Thus, the odds are quite favorable.

While waiting for more information, such as a player’s performance during the regular season, the lines shift and become less favorable. That’s because the oddsmakers are gathering information and applying new data and analytics to their lines to make them as accurate as possible.

You must decide which approach works best for your betting strategy as a bettor. Do you want to wager when the lines are released with little information at your disposal but the best potential return on your bet, or do you want to wait until you have more solid information to craft your MVP speculation?

Who decides the NBA MVP winner?

The NBA MVP is selected annually by a panel of sportswriters and broadcasters who vote for the players they believe are the best in the league.

This format, which started in 1980, sees each member of the panel vote for their top three players. Every first-place vote is worth five points, every second-place is worth three, and third-place is worth a single point.

One player rarely receives all of the first-place votes. That last happened in the 2015-16 season when Steph Curry of the Golden State Warriors earned all possible first-place points.

Because there is no set criteria for awarding the regular-season NBA MVP, it’s notoriously difficult to predict who will get the nod. There are often late-season shifts among the favorites, and there are even seasons in which the winner is considered an upset and more prominent players are snubbed.

A recent history of NBA MVP winners

Here is a list of the NBA MVPs since 2010.
