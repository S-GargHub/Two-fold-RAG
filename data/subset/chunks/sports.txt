Decimal, fractional, and American Odds are the most common betting formats. Oddsmakers set odds for an event before releasing them to the public. As games progress, lines continue to evolve based on team performances. If too many wagers favor one outcome, sportsbooks adjust the odds to balance the bets. Winning a moneyline bet is very straightforward. A loss simply means that the team or individual you bet on did not win. Moneyline odds are presented with either a positive (+) or negative (-) sign. A negative moneyline indicates the favorite and a positive sign indicates the underdog. Moneyline odds for a game between the New York Yankees and the Boston Red Sox might look like this: If you bet $120 on the Yankees and they win, you'd earn $100. If there's a tie in a moneyline bet, it is typically referred to as a \"push\" When a push occurs, bettors are refunded their original wager",
