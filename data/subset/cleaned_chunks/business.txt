Casino operator Star Entertainment Group's shares hit an all-time low after it raised $565 million. Amazon tumbled 4 per cent after the Federal Trade Commission and 17 state attorneys general filed an antitrust lawsuit against it. They accuse the e-commerce behemoth of using its dominant position to inflate prices on other platforms, overcharge sellers and stifle competition. Apple fell 2.3 per cent and Microsoft lost 1.7 per cent. The Federal Trade Commission filed a sweeping antitrust lawsuit against Amazon. The agency accused Amazon of wielding its monopoly power to squeeze merchants and thwart rivals. The FTC is seeking to hold Amazon liable for allegedly violating anti-monopoly law. Amazon general counsel David Zapolsky said third-party sellers set their own prices. Sellers on Amazon say the FTC's complaint is misguided. One seller says he's been critical of Amazon over the years. Another seller says Amazon has removed some of the challenges that used to be part of running an online business. The FTC has filed a lawsuit against Amazon for allegedly violating antitrust laws. Sellers have zeroed in on Amazon’s pricing policies and rising fees as rightful areas of concern in the FTC's lawsuit. Molson Hart, whose company Viahart sells toys on Amazon, has been a longtime critic of Amazon's pricing policies. Hart said Amazon sales comprise about 90% of his business. The question of whether AI will elevate the world or destroy it has framed an ongoing debate among Silicon Valley founders, chatbot users, academics, legislators and regulators. The debate has pitted some of the world’s richest men against one another: Musk, Page, Mark Zuckerberg of Meta, tech investor Peter Thiel, Satya Nadella of Microsoft and Sam Altman of OpenAI. All have fought for a piece of the business – which one day could be worth trillions of dollars – and the power to shape it. Thiel had become enormously wealthy through an early investment in Facebook and through his work with Musk in the early days of PayPal. He had developed a fascination with the singularity, a trope of science fiction that describes the moment when intelligent technology can no longer be controlled by humanity. Hassabis assumed that lots of people at the party would be trying to squeeze their host for money.",

Elon Musk invested in DeepMind, breaking his own informal rule – that he would not invest in any company he didn’t run himself. The board had been set up at the insistence of the startup’s founders to ensure that no harm after the sale would come to their technology. DeepMind’s founders were increasingly worried about what Google would do with their inventions. In 2017, they tried to break away from the company. Google responded by increasing the salaries and stock award packages of the DeepMind founders and their staff. The ethics board never had a second meeting. OpenAI was founded by Dario Amodei, a researcher with ties to the effective altruist community. He was unhappy about the Microsoft deal because he thought it was taking OpenAI in a commercial direction. He and other researchers went to the board to try to push Altman out, according to five people familiar with the matter. After they failed, they left.",

Sam Bankman-Fried, the former CEO of crypto exchange FTX, is on trial in New York. He is accused of running a Ponzi scheme that stole billions of dollars from customers. His lawyers argue that he acted in good faith and that he was not a fraud. The prosecution called its first two witnesses to the stand. The first was a victim: Marc-Antoine Julliard, a Paris-born cocoa trader who lives in London. Shortly afterward, the government called Adam Yedidia, a college friend of Bankman-Fried. The fence that separated Israel and the Gaza Strip was completed in December 2021. It was intended to protect against a major security threat, but in practice it was much leaner than that. The fence was almost unmanned by soldiers, and relied mainly on sensors, above and below ground, surveillance cameras, and vehicle patrols. The IDF has been praising the ethos of a small and smart army, implicitly if not explicitly. In recent years, it has publicized countless technological projects and present itself as a high-tech army. However, there is a problem at the outset, says Prof. Matar Eviatar of Tel Aviv University. The Iron Dome system is representative as the technological response to the threat from Gaza. Some say its success was paradoxical. Iron Dome was so successful it not only supported the decision-making process but fundamentally changed it. The correct way to integrate technology with security is to implement it as part of an operational concept, not as a single component. Despite Iron Dome, Israel found it difficult to stand up against the significant disruption of daily life on the home front. The longer as we delay cutting the direct connection between the Hamas rockets and those of our other enemies, the longer we will be condemned to watch from the sidelines. Eiland: \"This is exactly the same type of failure that was at the basis of Israeli thinking at the outbreak of the Yom Kippur War\" \"They thought the chance of war breaking out was low, they thought it was an exercise, but they didn't calculate the potential damage\"\n\nASX set to open lower as Wall Street closes September with more losses.

Israel's blockade of Gaza means that a region the size of Philadelphia faces a real risk of starvation, says Peace Studies scholar. International aid groups are warning that they cannot deliver food and other basic services to people in the Gaza Strip. Israel stopped allowing deliveries of food, fuel and other supplies to Gaza’s 2.3 million residents on Oct. 10, 2023. UNRWA runs 22 hospitals in Gaza that employ almost 1,000 health staff and has 3.3 million patient visits per year. Its schools are converted into humanitarian shelters in times of crisis, such as the current war. In 2018, the Trump Administration cut almost all of the money the U.S. typically gives to UNRWA. Sam Bankman-Fried faces seven federal charges, including wire fraud, securities fraud and money laundering, that could put him in prison for the rest of his life. Gary Wang, the lesser-known co-founder of FTX, was asked by Assistant U.S. Attorney Nicolas Roos on Thursday, \"Did you commit financial crimes while working at FTX?\" \"Yes,\" responded Wang. Gary Wang, who first met Bankman-Fried during high school at a summer camp, owned 10% of Alameda, while his boss owned the other 90%. Wang told the court about the advantages that Alameda received by having code baked into FTX's software that allowed special access to the crypto exchange. Those privileges ultimately resulted in Alameda owing FTX $8 billion worth of customer deposits. Yedidia said he was concerned because it \"seemed like a lot of money\" from FTX customers was at risk. He received multiple bonuses of more than $12 million in cash and company equity. Matt Huang, co-founder and managing partner of Paradigm, invested over $275 million in FTX. ChatGPT co-founder and CEO Sam Altman has been pushed out of OpenAI. A review found he was “not consistently candid in his communications” with the board of directors. Mira Murati, OpenAI’s chief technology officer, will take over as interim CEO effective immediately. Altman catapulted ChatGPT to global fame in the year since the startup's launch. OpenAI started out as a nonprofit when it launched with financial backing from Tesla CEO Elon Musk and others. Its stated aims were to “advance digital intelligence in the way that is most likely to benefit humanity as a whole, unconstrained by a need to generate financial return”\n\nEnergy companies (down one per cent) weighed down the index.

The most valuable US stock fell 0.5 per cent despite reporting stronger profit. Judge Arthur Engoron rules that Donald Trump defrauded banks with 'fantasy' to build his real estate empire. Trump's lawyers had asked the judge to throw out the case, which he denied. The decision is the strongest repudiation yet of Trump’s image as a wealthy and shrewd real estate mogul. Judge rejects defense argument that disclaimers on financial statements insulate liars from liability. James has asked Engoron to ban Trump and his three eldest children from ever again running a company based New York. She also wants Trump and the Trump Organization barred from entering into commercial real estate acquisitions for five years.

Eric Trump has been accused of significantly over-valuing his downtown Manhattan office tower. New York State argues Trump valued his 40 Wall Street property at $US200 million in 2011 and $US220 million in 2012. Despite this, the property was valued in financial statements at $ US524 million and $ US527 million, respectively, for those years. The property is also subject to a ground lease that resets in 2032. Based on current rent, that means the ground lease would jump to $US30 million from about $US2.6 million now. occupancy slid to 77% in June, down from 98% in 2015.",
