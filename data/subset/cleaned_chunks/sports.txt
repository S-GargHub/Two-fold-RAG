All Blacks had their chances, but their usual safe handling, a feature throughout the World Cup after their first-up loss to France. The Springboks took a 12-3 lead after 34 minutes when the All Blacks once again failed to release on their goal line. Will Jordan, the impressive young outside back who scored eight tries, had a difficult night and was replaced midway through the second half. The All Blacks managed to cut the deficit to 12-6 after 37 minutes when Eben Etzebeth was caught offside. New Zealand face Argentina in Rugby World Cup semi-final on Saturday.

Line shopping is the key that unlocks the best odds and lines at top sports betting sites. The best sportsbooks employ oddsmakers and oddsmaking services to set their lines and odds. You can shop around using multiple sportsbook apps on your phone or live odds feeds like the one above. When you bet, you lock in the odds or line as currently posted.

Moneyline betting distills sports to their essence: cheering for a victor. Every moneyline bet has a favorite and an underdog as determined by the sportsbook. You'll typically encounter three types of odds when researching and handicapping across various platforms—decimal, fractional, and American. Moneyline betting outcomes include a win, a loss or a draw. Winning a moneyline bet is very straightforward. All you need to do is pick the team or individual who is going to win an event and choose correctly. A loss simply means that the team you bet on did not win the event or matchup. Moneyline bets hinge on the outright winner of a game or event. A positive moneyline (+) indicates the underdog and represents the amount of profit on a $100 bet. If there's a tie in a moneyline bet, it is typically referred to as a \"push\" When a push occurs, bettors are refunded their original wager. Sportsbooks adjust moneyline odds to ensure they remain profitable, balance their book, and reflect the most current information about the event. Changes in factors like player injuries, player substitutions, or even changes in weather conditions can affect the perceived outcome of an event. Bettors can wager on which player they believe will win the coveted NBA Rookie of the Year award as part of NBA futures betting.

West Indies beat England by four wickets in first T20 international in Barbados. Andre Russell and Rovman Powell hit winning runs with 11 balls remaining.

With five weeks left in the regular season, there is plenty of time for a longshot to become a contender. If you wait too long before placing a bet, your payout will be less. Demar Hamlin is the current favorite to win Comeback Player of the Year. Russell Wilson is a longshot to win CPOY. Hamlin has seldom been active on game day and rarely seen the field. Wilson was supposed to be the next great franchise quarterback for the Broncos. Rashee Rice has four straight games with at least nine targets and he's scored at least 14 PPR Fantasy points in all of those games. The Raiders have surrendered the 11th-fewest passing yards this season, but they've given up the fourth-most yards after the catch. Puka Nacua needs 18 more catches to set the rookie record for most catches in a season. Drake London is averaging 15.88 PPR FPPG at home and just 7.37 on the road. Curtis Samuel was the top waiver wire add at wide receiver last week as well, but he still sits at just 57% rostered. Demario Douglas' first game back was a disappointment but he has nine targets in two of his last three games. Dontayvion Wicks might just be the best option available if Christian Watson and Jayden Reed remain out. Waddle has been the quintessential DFS tournament play as of late with three of seven games over 19 PPR Fantasy points, topping 26 twice. There is at least a chance that Hill won't be 100% and Waddle will still be Tua Tagovailoa's top target. Jaleel McLaughlin made three splash plays of 21, 22 and 38 yards last week. He played just 10 snaps in the second half when the Broncos were trailing. McLaughlin's worst asset is his power as he just won't finish runs with physicality. Zay Flowers was targeted downfield more last week than in any game this season with a 15.27 Average Depth of Target. Justice Hill has the team's best rushing average on zone runs this year. Christian Kirk, Marquise Brown, Michael Pittman and Jakobi Meyers are better options as WR2 options. Tennessee has allowed exactly 50% of pass attempts of 15-plus Air Yards to all wide receivers to be completed for a bottom-five yards per catch allowed rate. This matchup has an over/under of 42.5 points, tied for fourth-lowest of the week. Logan Thomas is worth the risk considering how the Falcons have let up numbers to tight ends. Kyle Pitts has the lowest catch rate (56.3%) and worst YAC/reception average (1.33 yards) of all qualifying tight ends. Logan Thomas saw at least 22.9% of Sam Howell's targets in Weeks 1 and 5. No team has allowed more first-down receptions to tight ends (17) Cole Kmet has averaged seven targets per game with a 24.6% target share. He's second to D.J. Moore in all of those categories except red-zone targets, where he's first. Kmet could handle more short-area throws than normal. Tyler Lockett sees more targets on a route-run basis against man coverage (28%) compared to zone (21%). Jeff Wilson will have some good opportunities with the Dolphins' approach to utilize multiple backs. DeVon Achane hit Injured Reserve with a knee injury. Jonathan Taylor played just 16% of the snaps to Zack Moss' 80% last week. The Colts have an edge with their offensive line getting a step on the Jaguars' front. Every running back with at least 10 carries against the Panthers this season has posted at least nine non-PPR points. Michael Pittman is best as a low-end WR2 in PPR leagues but no better than a flex in half- and non-PPR. Nico Collins could get a lot of short-yardage targets against the Saints. Chris Godwin could be a flex ahead of Tyler Lockett, Jaylen Waddle and Gabe Davis. Brock Purdy has hit at least 20 Fantasy points in 9 of his 10 regular-season starts. Purdy was off-target on 0.0% of his throws against the Browns last week. The 49ers defense running hot and the Browns offense figuring to get stuffed should make for a game script for Purdy. Jerome Ford has averaged 4.3 yards per rush and 7.7 yards per catch since taking over for Chubb. P.J.",

No team allows fewer yards per catch to wideouts than the 49ers (9.7) Only three receivers -- Puka Nacua, Marquise Brown and Michael Wilson -- have had more than 15 PPR points against them. Emari Demercado is expected to work with Keaontay Ingram in the Cardinals backfield. The Rams have taken a step forward as a decent run defense. Jared Goff is good enough to start ahead of Trevor Lawrence, Sam Howell and Geno Smith. Garrett Wilson was off-target on 15.4% of his throws for the second consecutive week. He led the Jets in targets (seven) but was second behind Tyler Conklin in catches and yards. Wilson's situation continues to hold him back from the potential he so clearly has. Darren Waller has the highest target share on the G-Men, but it's 20.8%. His ADOT also sits at 8.9, and both that number and the target share got lifted up by the Giants' decision to force-feed targets to Waller last week. Waller is a low-end starter in the same range as Kyle Pitts. The Chargers rank fourth-worst in pass rush pressure rate at 29.5% this season. Prescott's QB coach and/or playcaller for the prior five seasons will be coaching the Chargers offense on Sunday.

Point spread betting is a bet on the difference in the score between teams (or players) in a specific game or event. The favored team is provided a point spread or handicap to try to equalize the odds with the less-favored team. If the underdog wins the contest outright, they’re also the spread winner. A \"push\" in betting refers to a situation where the final result of an event matches the set point spread. When a push occurs, the wagers are typically refunded.

The favorite must win by more than the spread to \"cover\" and be considered a winning bet.
