A leaked internal memo from Google earlier this year seemed to express fears that despite the huge advances made by proprietary LLM models, open source AI would ultimately trump them all. Meta is perhaps best positioned to capitalize on the mess that OpenAI has created for itself. It’s still too early to make any surefire claims on what impact the OpenAI fallout will have on LLM development. And is that fair? The process of this test did remind me how much data Google collects — not just my searches but anything I say to a smart speaker. The data collection does also mean that Google (not just search but also mobile widgets and other services) personalises to me more effectively. Google denies pushing users towards the most monetisable subjects. Ad keyword matching is a long-standing and well-known process that is designed to connect people to relevant ads. A separate process, which has nothing to do with ads, is used to match organic results to a query. If you allow it, Google does bring in some information it knows about you to further refine results.

European Union regulators have sent Amazon a formal statement of objections setting out competition concerns over its proposed acquisition of robot vacuum maker, iRobot. The step does not confirm the EU will seek to block the deal but it shows antitrust regulators do remain concerned. It could therefore push Amazon to offer remedies to EU authorities to settle the investigation and avoid the risk of the acquisition being blocked. The EU already extracted commitments from Amazon after earlier investigations. Amazon has also been named a gatekeeper under the EU’s shiny new ex ante competition regulation. This designation means Amazon must comply with a series of up-front obligations, which include restrictions on self preferencing. Fortnite maker Epic Games will go to trial with Google today.

ChatGPT, OpenAI’s viral AI chatbot, turns one today. A year ago, the company released ChatGPT as a “low-key research preview” The goal was to gather more data on how people use and interact with generative AI. ChatGPT can complete and debug code, compose music and essays, answer test questions, write poetry and song lyrics, translate and summarize text and even emulate a computer running Linux. While undeniably capable, ChatGPT is far from perfect, owing to the way it was developed and “taught” ChatGPT can accomplish these tasks given carefully engineered prompts and foreknowledge. GPTs introduce a level of personalization far beyond that ChatGPT offers today. Some of the initial G PTs include a Gen Z meme translator, a coloring book and sticker creator, a data visualizer and a board game explainer. ChatGPT, OpenAI’s text-generating AI chatbot, has taken the world by storm. Since its initial launch nearly a year ago, ChatGPT has hit 100 million weekly active users. OpenAI has struck a new deal with Berlin-based news publisher Axel Springer. ChatGPT mobile apps top 110M installs and nearly $30M in revenue. OpenAI makes repeating words “forever” a violation of its terms of service after Google DeepMind test. Lawmakers in Brazil enact an ordinance written by ChatGPT.

Creators say engagement on their posts tanked specifically after they publicly condemned Israel’s response to the Hamas attack.

For a few hundred bucks, a firm in India or the Philippines could provide thousands of links. SEO is a trade in which people try to get more traffic for their sites. The exact formula for how and why one website gets placed over another is top secret. With no clear chain of cause and effect around why a site’s ranking has changed, a less talented practitioner can take on a premodern farmer. SEOs artificially boost a website’s ranking; you are supposed to be designing websites for human readers, not for the algorithm. Many SEOs do exactly this kind of work: rewriting copy, making a site load more quickly, etc. But the existence of good SEOs does not negate the presence of scammers and idiots. Matt Cutts was a celebrity among SEOs, constantly mobbed with questions and complaints. Forrester felt that Google projected an attitude: “We know what we’re doing, we will stop your attempts to game this.” After Matt Cutts left, Google replaced him with a handful of people.

Amazon's newest ad-supported Kindle is on sale for $79.99 ($20 off) with three months of Kindle Unlimited included. The latest Kindle puts Amazon’s base e-reader more in line with the most recent Kindle Paperwhite. The new entry-level model has arrived alongside a new Kindle Kids, which is identical to the standard model but provides age-appropriate content. Amazon’s latest Kindle Paperwhite is its 11th-gen model, which comes with USB-C support, longer battery life, and a larger 6.8-inch display. All 2021 models are also similar to the 2018 model in that they feature a waterproof design and Audible audiobook support. The ad-supported Kindle Oasis is only retailing at Amazon right now starting at $250. The Steam Deck OLED arrives November 16 with an improved screen and longer battery life. The original Steam Deck had a 7-inch 800p LCD running at 60Hz. The new model squeezes a 7.4-inch OLED screen into the same space, significantly shrinking the bezels around the display. The Steam Deck OLED will be available to order on November 16th at 1PM ET. There’s also a Limited Edition version of the 1TB model, with a translucent shell and a customized carry case, which will be sold at $679. The updated pricing on the existing LCD models is already in effect. EU says incoming rules for general purpose AIs can evolve over time. Lawmakers’ choice of term for regulating the most powerful models behind the current boom in generative AI tools. EU Act refers to “general purpose” AI models and systems. High risk tier will face ex ante-style regulatory requirements to assess and mitigate systemic risks. GPAIs must proactively test model outputs to shrink risks of actual (or “reasonably foreseeable”) negative effects on public health, safety, public security, fundamental rights, or for society as a whole. “low tier” GPAIs will only face lighter transparency requirements. Banned AI uses include social scoring and selfie scraping for facial recognition databases. Banned uses will get up and running in the second half of 2024, assuming no last minute opposition to the regulation springs up within the Council or Parliament. (For the full list of banned AI uses, read our earlier post.)\n\nThe Samsung S95C is one of our favorite TVs, thanks to its quantum dot OLED panel. For gamers, the LG C3 is our top TV pick. If you like mechanical keyboards, the NZXT Function is a great jumping-off point. The Galaxy Buds2 Pro (9/10, WIRED Recommends) are one of our top earbud picks.
