UPDATE: Nov. 27, 2023, 5:00 a.m. EST This post has been updated with all of the latest Cyber Monday deals available at Amazon.

Amazon is dragging out the year's biggest shopping holiday(s) into 11 days of deals.

The retail giant began its Black Friday sale in the early morning of Friday, Nov. 17 (a week ahead of schedule) and was on top of making the switch to Cyber Monday language in the wee hours of Saturday, Nov. 25. Official Cyber Monday mode, which is currently on through Monday, Nov. 27, includes both a ton of deals carried over from Black Friday plus some new ones.

We're curating a running list of Amazon's best Cyber Weekend deals, spotlighting some of our favorites and noting when good deals inevitably sell out. Read on for the full rundown, and check back often: We're going to be updating this story incessantly as the sale continues, as well as our even bigger (if you can imagine) list of Cyber Monday deals across more retailers.

Note: All newly added deals are marked with a ‚ú®, while deals with a üî• have dropped to an all-time low price. Amazon's invite-only deals for Prime members are marked with a üì®. Deals with a strikeout were either sold out or expired at the time of writing.

Why we like it

An Echo Show is a subtle yet game-changing addition to any room ‚Äî and for less than $40 with this rollover Black Friday to Cyber Monday deal, there's little reason to not make your life easier. The smart screen responds to Alexa commands that are particularly handy when your hands are full, like asking for measurement conversions mid-cooking, checking the weather mid-rushing out the door, or turning off your smart lights with a sleeping kid in hand. Plus, it's got a 5.5-inch screen and better sound than its predecessor, making it perfect for watching videos or video calling friends and family.

Now that the 64GB 9th generation iPad has been going in and out of stock (you might be able to find it on sale for $229.99), our new favorite iPad deal at Amazon is the 10th generation 64GB model for $349.

MacBooks aside (which are all listed above in the Apple section), another stellar Cyber Monday laptop deal at Amazon is the lightweight Microsoft Surface Laptop Go 3 for $599.99. This 25% discount drops the 2023 version to the regular asking price of our favorite budget laptop, the older Surface Go 2. Compared to the Go 2, the Go 3's Intel Core i5 processor is 12th gen versus the Go 2's 11th gen, harnessing better speeds and solid power for most everyday work or school tasks. On the outside, the Go 3 is definitely giving MacBook Air ‚Äî the main difference being that the Go 3's screen is a touchscreen.

Jada Pinkett Smith has revealed that she and husband Will Smith have been separated for the last seven years.

The Girls Trip star, 52, shared in a new interview with People published on 11 October that she and the King Richard actor, 55, are ‚Äústill figuring it out‚Äù when it comes to their marriage of 26 years. She explained at the time of the 2022 Academy Awards, when Will slapped Chris Rock, they had been separated for six years.

‚ÄúWe‚Äôve been doing some really heavy-duty work together,‚Äù Jada said. ‚ÄúWe just got deep love for each other and we are going to figure out what that looks like for us.‚Äù

The pair have been married since 1997 and share son Jaden, 25, and daughter Willow, 22. The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air star also has a son Trey, 30, whom he shares with his first wife, Sheree Zampino.

As for her children, Jada praised them for how they‚Äôve helped her grow. ‚ÄúMy children, they‚Äôre little gurus. They‚Äôve taught me a deep sense of self-acceptance,‚Äù she told the outlet.

Jada and Will have often opened up about their relationship over the years, and have had very public ups and downs throughout their marriage. Here‚Äôs a timeline of their relationship.

1994: Will and Jada meet on the set of The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air

Will and Jada met after she auditioned for the role of Will‚Äôs girlfriend on The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air. While she did not get the part, the pair hit it off - despite Will being married to Sheree Zampino at the time, with who he shares son Trey.

‚ÄúI had a realisation I wasn‚Äôt with the person I was supposed to be with,‚Äù he told Jada‚Äôs Red Table Talk in 2018. ‚ÄúI was sitting in a [bathroom] stall and I was crying and laughing uncontrollably, and I knew [Jada] was the woman I was supposed to be with.‚Äù

1995: The pair officially begin dating

It wasn‚Äôt until 1995 that Will and Jada began seriously dating after Will finalised his divorce from Zampino.

1997: Will and Jada get engaged and married

Will popped the question to Jada in November 1997 before getting married just one month later in Baltimore.

Jada wasn‚Äôt initially sold on the idea of marriage. She told People in 2019: ‚ÄúI never wanted to get married. But my mother was like: ‚ÄòYou have to get married‚Äô - she‚Äôs so old-school - and Will wanted a family. So I said: ‚ÄòAll right, maybe it‚Äôs something I should do.‚Äô‚Äù

1998: Their first child is born

Jada and Will‚Äôs first child together, son Jayden, was born in July 1998.

2000: Their second child was born

Jada and Will welcomed daughter Willow in 2000.

2013: Jada denies open marriage rumours (sort of)

After a quiet decade and a half making movies and raising their children, Jada took to Facebook to address rumours she and Will were in an open relationship.

She wrote: ‚ÄúHere is how I will change my statement... Will and I BOTH can do WHATEVER we want, because we TRUST each other to do so. This does NOT mean we have an open relationship... this means we have a GROWN one.‚Äù

2015: Will addresses divorce rumours

Will addresses persistent separation rumours by clarifying the pair were not getting a divorce.

‚ÄúUnder normal circumstances, I don‚Äôt usually respond to foolishness. But, so many people have extended [to] me their ‚Äòdeepest condolences‚Äô that I figured - ‚ÄòWhat the hell‚Ä¶ I can be foolish, too!‚Äô‚Äù he wrote on Facebook at the time. ‚ÄúSo, in the interest of redundant, repetitious, over and over-again-ness‚Ä¶ Jada and I are‚Ä¶ NOT GETTING A DIVORCE!!!!!!!!!!!!!‚Äù

2018: Will revealed that he and Jada don‚Äôt refer to themselves as married

In an episode of TIDAL‚Äôs Rap Radar podcast, Will said he and Jada ‚Äúrefer to ourselves as life partners, where you get into that space where you realise you are literally with somebody for the rest of your life. There‚Äôs no deal breakers. There‚Äôs nothing she could do - ever. Nothing that would break our relationship. She has my support till death and it feels so good to get to that space.‚Äù

2020: August Alsina claims he had an affair with Jada

August Alsina and Jada were introduced in 2015, but it wasn‚Äôt until 2020 that he claimed that he and Jada had dated while she was married and that her and Will‚Äôs marriage was open during that time.

Alsina said Will gave him and Jada his ‚Äúblessing‚Äù, adding: ‚ÄúI actually sat down with Will and had a conversation due to the transformation from their marriage to life partnership that they‚Äôve spoken on several times and it not involving romanticism.‚Äù

Alsina added he ‚Äútotally gave myself to that relationship for years of my life and I truly and really, really deeply loved and have a ton of love for her.‚Äù

The same day Alsina‚Äôs claims surfaced Jada‚Äôs reps said they were ‚Äúabsolutely not true‚Äù.

Less than two weeks later, Jada and Will appeared on an episode of Jada‚Äôs Red Table Talk where Jada confirmed that she did have a relationship with Alsina, saying that she and Will were separated at the time.

‚ÄúWe decided that we were going to separate for a period of time and you go figure out how to make yourself happy and I‚Äôll figure out how to make myself happy,‚Äù Jada said at the time.

‚ÄúFrom there, as time went on, I got into a different kind of entanglement with August... Yes, it was a relationship absolutely.‚Äù

Jada also said that Will didn‚Äôt give permission, as the only person who could give her permission was herself.

2021: Jada discusses her and Will‚Äôs sex life, Will‚Äôs memoir is released

In another episode of Red Table Talk in October 2021, Jada said it ‚Äútakes work‚Äù to maintain a spark in the bedroom.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs hard... the thing Will and I talk about a lot is the journey. We started in this [relationship] at a very young age, 22 years old... I think you expect your partner to know - especially when it comes to sex. It‚Äôs like: ‚ÄòWell, if you love me, you should know. If you love me, you should read my mind.‚Äô That‚Äôs a huge pitfall,‚Äù she said at the time.

The next month, Will‚Äôs memoir is released which details several issues the couple have had over the years. He wrote they were ‚Äúsuffering the brutal death of our romantic fantasies, the burning away of the idealistic illusion of the perfect marriage and the perfect family. Neither of us wanted a divorce; we knew we loved each other, and some aspects of our union were magical. But the structure of the life that we had established was strangling both of us.‚Äù

2022: No infidelity statement and Oscars incident

During an interview on CBS Sunday Morning earlier this month, Will said he and Jada had never accused each other of cheating.

He said: ‚ÄúNever. There‚Äôs never been infidelity in our marriage...And we have never surprised one another with anything ever..I have decided that chatter about my life can be of a benefit to people. I think that chatter is the first stage to having a real conversation and being able to truly explore if some of the things in your heart are loving, or poisonous.‚Äù

In March 2022, Will slapped Chris Rock at the 94th annual Oscars before he yelled at the comedian to ‚Äúkeep my wife‚Äôs name out your f***ing mouth‚Äù. It quickly became the most talked-about moment of the evening with the pair initially appearing to laugh off the tense moment.

The altercation came after Rock said: ‚ÄúJada, I love you. GI Jane 2, can‚Äôt wait to see you,‚Äù referring to Jada‚Äôs shaved head. While accepting the award for Best Actor, Will became teary as said he was a ‚Äúfierce defender of his family‚Äù.",A timeline of Will Smith and Jada Pinkett Smith‚Äôs relationship amid separation,https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/love-sex/will-smith-jada-pinkett-relationship-timeline-divorce-b2427925.html,The Independent - Life and Style

Fans have spotted Travis Kelce wearing a friendship bracelet with Taylor Swift lyrics on it, just days before she attended his Kansas City Chiefs game.

In a video posted to TikTok on 25 September, a fan shared a photo of Kelce posing with the piece of jewellery on his wrist. The post came after Swift was seen enthusiastically cheering him on in the box seats at Arrowhead Stadium, fuelling speculation that she and the athlete are dating.

The now-viral photo shows how Kelce may have hinted at the ongoing dating rumours before Swift attended his game. The snap showed Kelce posing at the Kelce Car Jam charity event on Friday 22 September, where he was sporting a beaded friendship bracelet that read: ‚ÄúVigilante S***‚Äù

The beads on the friendship bracelet appeared to reference Swift‚Äôs song ‚ÄúVigilante S***‚Äù from her 2022 album, Midnights. In addition to the Swiftie-themed jewellery, Kelce also wore a white striped shirt with silver chain necklaces, black sunglasses, and black pants for the event.

In the comments, fans both praised and questioned Kelce for the beaded friendship bracelet. Many people also pointed out how fans of the ‚ÄúBad Blood‚Äù singer famously trade and wear friendship bracelets at Swift‚Äôs Eras Tour concerts.

‚ÄúOF ALL 230 SONGS IN THE DISCOGRAPHY I‚ÄôM SICK,‚Äù one fan commented, while another person wrote: ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs unbelievable how invested I am in this.‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôm gonna need to go back and see all photos of him from the last three months and dissect if he‚Äôs wearing friendship bracelets,‚Äù a third wrote.

In other photos from the charity event - which were shared to Instagram by Jordan‚Äôs KC photography - Kelce wasn‚Äôt seen wearing the friendship bracelet, leading many people to believe that he received the bracelet from a fan that day.

Two days after his charity event, the ‚ÄúAll Too Well‚Äù singer was spotted cheering for the Kansas City Chiefs tight end from the box seats at Arrowhead Stadium in Kansas City, Missouri. Not only was she seen sitting next to Kelce‚Äôs mother, Donna, but she also appeared to yell ‚Äúlet‚Äôs f***ing go‚Äù in response to Kelce‚Äôs third-quarter touchdown reception.

After the game, which saw the Chiefs beat the Chicago Bears 41-10, Kelce was seen leaving the stadium in a blue and white splatter-paint denim suit. Eagle-eyed fans were quick to believe that Kelce‚Äôs outfit paid homage to Swift‚Äôs forthcoming album, 1989 (Taylor‚Äôs Version), which is due for re-release on 27 October.

After the two escaped the crowd at Arrowhead Stadium in Kelce‚Äôs convertible, according to photos and videos posted online, the football star reportedly rented out Prime Social Rooftop in Kansas City for a post-game celebration with his family, his teammates, and Swift.

‚ÄúTravis bought out the restaurant for his family and team. Taylor arrived, wearing a denim dress, and was seen snacking, having some cocktails and dancing alongside Travis,‚Äù the witness told Entertainment Tonight. ‚ÄúThe two were very affectionate with one another but kept things fun and lighthearted. Travis‚Äô teammates also showed up to the after-party, as well as his mom, Donna Kelce. The party lasted until 2 am.‚Äù

The late-night outing came days after the NFL star officially addressed ongoing dating rumours about him and the ‚ÄúAnti-Hero‚Äù singer. During an episode of The Pat McAfee Show on 21 September, he mocked his brother Jason Kelce for joking that he ‚Äú100 per cent‚Äù believed his younger sibling was dating Swift.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs hilarious how much traction this has actually gotten, right now it‚Äôs like a game of telephone,‚Äù Kelce said. ‚ÄúWhere everybody‚Äôs whispering in each other‚Äôs ears and hearing random stuff. No one actually knows what‚Äôs going on, especially when you got Jason Kelce on live television telling people just both sides - he doesn‚Äôt know, it‚Äôs true, this and that.‚Äù

He also noted that he was still open to pursuing a relationship with Swift, revealing that he subtly asked if she‚Äôd want to attend one of his football games.

‚ÄúI threw it out there, I threw the ball in her court,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúI told her, you know, I‚Äôve seen you rock the stage in Arrowhead [Stadium], you might have to come see me rock the stage in Arrowhead and see which one‚Äôs a little more lit. So, we‚Äôll see what happens in the near future.‚Äù

Back in July, Kelce first confessed that he tried - and failed - to give Swift his number by giving her a friendship bracelet at one of her Eras Tour concerts. ‚ÄúI was disappointed that she doesn‚Äôt talk before or after her shows, because she has to save her voice for the 44 songs that she sings,‚Äù he explained to his brother on their podcast.

‚ÄúSo I was a little butthurt I didn‚Äôt get to hand her one of the bracelets I made for her,‚Äù Kelce said. ‚ÄúIf you‚Äôre up on Taylor Swift concerts, there are friendship bracelets and I received a bunch of them being there, but I wanted to give Taylor Swift one with my number on it.‚Äù",Fans spot Travis Kelce wearing Taylor Swift-themed friendship bracelet before she attended his game,https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/travis-kelce-taylor-swift-friendship-bracelet-b2419065.html,The Independent - Life and Style

Longtime Hollywood couple Will Smith and Jada Pinkett Smith sent shockwaves around the world this week when the Red Table Talk host revealed that she and the actor have been separated since 2016. Both Jada and Will have previously doubled down on their stance against getting a divorce, but her recent reveal about their lengthy separation poses a new question: When should couples just get a divorce?

In an interview with People on 10 October, Jada shared that during the 2022 Academy Awards - when Will slapped Chris Rock after he cracked a joke about Jada‚Äôs appearance - the pair had actually been separated for six years. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve been doing some really heavy-duty work together,‚Äù she explained, while promoting her new memoir, Worthy. ‚ÄúWe just got deep love for each other and we are going to figure out what that looks like for us.‚Äù

She praised her and Will‚Äôs two children - Jaden, 25, and Willow, 22 - for being her ‚Äúlittle gurus‚Äù throughout this time, noting that they‚Äôve taught her ‚Äúa deep sense of self-acceptance‚Äù. Although the married couple are not living together, she insisted that their marriage has never been an open one, as she and Will have ‚Äúeliminated the chance of betrayal‚Äù while going on to live their ‚Äúseparate lives‚Äù.

This isn‚Äôt the first time that Jada and Will have taken some time apart from each other. During a 2020 episode of her Facebook Watch series, Red Table Talk, Jada disclosed that while she and Will were separated amicably, she had a relationship with singer August Alsina, describing their involvement as an ‚Äúentanglement‚Äù.

Throughout their marriage of 26 years, the A-listers have made it clear that divorce was never in the cards. Jada furthered that belief during a preview for an interview with Today‚Äôs Hoda Kotb, which aired on 13 October. ‚ÄúI made a promise that there will never be a reason for us to get a divorce,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúWe will work through, whatever. I just haven‚Äôt been able to break that promise.‚Äù

Of course, outsiders aren‚Äôt fully aware of the ‚Äúheavy-duty work‚Äù that Jada and Will have done throughout their marriage. But the amount of time they‚Äôve spent separated begs questions about all long-term relationships in general. When is it the time for couples to throw the towel in? And when should separations ultimately become the end result that couples have tried to avoid: divorce.

While there‚Äôs never a simple answer to the question, relationship experts have discovered the signs that it‚Äôs time to keep fighting for the one you love, or time to let them go.

Speaking to The Independent, New York City-based relationship expert Susan Winter highlighted the jarring differences between a separation and divorce. When it comes to divorce, Hollywood couples can notably get involved in lengthy legal processes, from dividing financial assets to creating child custody agreements. Although we don‚Äôt know the terms of Jada and Will‚Äôs separation, Winter believes that they‚Äôre showcasing a non-conventional relationship that‚Äôs not familiar to the public. Will and Jada‚Äôs dynamic includes living in separate homes, but it could be a choice that‚Äôs for the better.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs an LAT partnership, meaning ‚Äòliving apart together,‚Äô‚Äù Winter said. ‚ÄúWhile everybody is at a different point as to why they are doing this, the centre point is the same: the preservation of the partnership is paramount. Separations can also be beneficial if both individuals are working on themselves and have the mutual goal of reuniting, or making their relationship better. However, that doesn‚Äôt necessarily mean that their improved relationship will result in them living together again.‚Äù

On the other hand, dating coach Jacob Lucas - who‚Äôs based in the UK - acknowledged that not all separations end in resolutions. When couples opt not to live together anymore, it could create an emotional disconnect between them. If a lack of connection occurred before couples separated, that separation doesn‚Äôt necessarily make the issues go away. In fact, Lucas believes that in these situations, couples could also be avoiding the inevitable breakup for the sake of comfortability.

‚ÄúThey‚Äôre not resolving their problems, they‚Äôre rescheduling them. So, if you separate from someone, but you live in a separate house and you‚Äôre still together, it seems to me you‚Äôre just not letting go of the past because you want to stick to what‚Äôs familiar,‚Äù he claimed. ‚ÄúPeople stick to what they know, and it‚Äôs like you have a tether to that person. Your brain‚Äôs like: ‚ÄòI cannot let go of them because I am scared of the unknown.‚Äô I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve ever seen a couple separate and come back again.‚Äù

It‚Äôs unclear whether Jada and Will plan on ending their separation and living in the same home again. However, the couple have been candid about their plans to not get a divorce. Jada previously recalled that when she first decided to get married to Will in 1997, it would be for the long haul. ‚ÄúI told Will from the gate, I said let me tell you something: ‚ÄòIf you marry me, know this: we‚Äôre gonna be together. We‚Äôre going to be under the same roof,‚Äô‚Äù she said during a 2018 episode of Red Table Talk. ‚ÄúFor me personally, I‚Äôm not mature enough to have a divorce, I‚Äôm just not. I don‚Äôt think I would ever be mature enough, I don‚Äôt.‚Äù

Will - who divorced his first wife, Sheree Zampino, in 1994 - has also shared similar sentiments about making his marriage with Jada work. Back in 2006, the Fresh Prince of Bel-Air star first explained to MTV News that divorce wasn‚Äôt an option for him and his second wife. ‚ÄúWith Jada, I stood up in front of God and said: ‚ÄòTil death do us part,‚Äô‚Äù he said at the time. ‚ÄúSo there are two possible outcomes. One, we are going to be together ‚Äòtil death, or two, I am dead.‚Äù

Speaking to The Independent, Lucas noted that while it‚Äôs important for both parties to be invested in their relationships, promising not to get a divorce could spark feelings of resentment down the line. Fans aren‚Äôt fully aware of why Will and Jada made that promise to each other, but the dating coach believes that an agreement like theirs could create a false narrative about a divorce.

‚ÄúGetting divorced shouldn‚Äôt feel like a taboo because people grow apart and that‚Äôs fine,‚Äù he explained. ‚ÄúPeople get stuck in relationships because of their friends and family or societal pressure, and they worry about getting divorced. They think a divorce has a stigma to its name, which it doesn‚Äôt, and they push aside the fact that they still essentially feel trapped with someone they don‚Äôt want to be with.‚Äù

Perhaps one of the reasons why Jada and Will have promised not to get a divorce is because they also agreed not to sign a prenuptial agreement. In an interview with Parade published on 13 October, Jada explained it was her special connection with Will that encouraged them not to sign a prenup before getting married.

‚ÄúI feel that was a very real moment for the two of us to look each other in the eyes, recognise that there would be tough times in this journey and to say to each other: ‚ÄòNo matter what, we‚Äôre going to figure it out and that‚Äôs why we don‚Äôt need a prenup, because I‚Äôm making a promise that divorce won‚Äôt be necessary, that we will figure this out,‚Äô‚Äù she recalled. ‚ÄúAnd we made that promise to each other without all of the bridal wedding beauty; it was just sitting on a log in his mother‚Äôs backyard, and going: ‚ÄòHey‚Äô - having to really look at the possibility of us not being together.‚Äù

Although they‚Äôve made their dedication to each other quite clear, there have been some grey areas over the last seven years about the terms of Will and Jada‚Äôs separation. In 2020, Jada made headlines when she revealed in a Red Table Talk episode with her husband that she had a relationship with Alsina. She explained that she and her husband were ‚Äúseparated amicably‚Äù when the romance occurred, which had not been disclosed to the press at the time. ‚ÄúWe decided that we were going to separate for a period of time and you go figure out how to make yourself happy and I‚Äôll figure out how to make myself happy,‚Äù Jada said. As the Girls Trip star recalled that she ‚Äúgot into a different kind of entanglement with August,‚Äù she was prompted by Will to confirm it ‚Äúwas a relationship, absolutely.‚Äù

Outsiders are now aware that Jada and Will have been separated since 2016, but the timeline of her relationship with Alsina is still fuzzy. Indeed, the terms of Will and Jada‚Äôs separation are still unknown to the public and in some cases, having separate relationships can give couples the clarity they need about their marriage.

‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs pivotal here is, what was the agreement? Did we agree to separate to work on ourselves for the purpose of coming back together again?‚Äù Winter said. ‚ÄúDid we agree to separate and just be alone for a while and not have that discussion? And in the second case, if you have an affair, sometimes it can bring you back to the original person. You can get whatever you need to achieve or gain a different perspective, allowing you to decide if you want to come back or leave for good.‚Äù

According to Lucas, some of the controversy surrounding Will and Jada‚Äôs relationship ties back to the 2022 Academy Awards - when the King Richard star jumped onto the stage and struck Rock across the face after the comedian made a joke about Jada‚Äôs shaved head, which is a result of her alopecia. ‚ÄúKeep my wife‚Äôs name out of your f***ing mouth,‚Äù Will yelled. Now that it‚Äôs been revealed the couple was separated at the time, Lucas questioned Will‚Äôs behaviour and word choice during the awards ceremony.

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs a weird reaction to have somebody who you‚Äôve been broken up with for six years, you know? So, were they really broken up or is Jada saying that as an attention-seeking thing?‚Äù he asked.

However, Winter still believes the controversial incident speaks different volumes about the work Will has put into his relationship. ‚ÄúI feel as though Will has a tremendous love and commitment to Jada, as well as to the marriage and the family unit,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúThe pride that he takes in defending his wife is extraordinary, almost to the detriment of his image, at times.‚Äù

Ultimately, the public will never fully know what ‚Äúheavy-duty work‚Äù Will and Jada are doing in their relationship, and according to Winter, it‚Äôs not necessarily any of our business. Still, she believes that their choice to separate is something fluid and outside of the traditional marriage design - an evolving model that could also come to serve other couples. If Will and Jada have been spending seven years apart as a married couple, why would they decide to go back to living in the same household?

‚ÄúThey‚Äôre in the rough with a machete, carving a new path for themselves,‚Äù Winter said. ‚ÄúWhy would they say: ‚ÄòHey, let‚Äôs go back to the house and just relax?‚Äô They‚Äôre really exploring something vastly different. It doesn‚Äôt end up that you go back into that little box of ‚Äòthis is a marriage, we‚Äôre living together‚Äô. It just doesn‚Äôt do that.‚Äù

Every relationship is different, living in the public eye or not. Although living separately may not be an issue for some couples, there can still be some major signs that it‚Äôs time to leave a relationship behind. ‚ÄúWhen there is no stone left unturned, or when they have tried every single combination possible to make the relationship function and yet it doesn‚Äôt, that‚Äôs the time to pull the plug,‚Äù Winter added. ‚ÄúThey‚Äôve done their individual work and they have done the work together and ended up in the same place.‚Äù

Will and Jada‚Äôs relationship could end in a variety of ways. The celebrity couple could stay separated, move back in together as a married pair, or they can get a divorce. However, there are still certain behaviours in a marriage that could signal it‚Äôs time to get a divorce.

‚ÄúIf you feel disrespected by your partner, feel humiliated, or were cheated on, you probably feel ready to split,‚Äù Lucas said. ‚ÄúI also think a real big one is, if you lose sexual attraction for your partner and you‚Äôve actively tried to get it back and can‚Äôt, it‚Äôs time to go.‚Äù",Jada Pinkett Smith and Will Smith have been separated since 2016 - when should couples just get divorced?,https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/will-smith-jada-separation-divorce-b2429576.html,The Independent - Life and Style
entertainment,Nell Geraets,2023-09-26T05:26:05+00:00,"The first link between Swift and Kelce was established in 2016, when Kelce ‚Äì who helped bring his team to Super Bowl victory in both 2020 and 2023 ‚Äì played the classic game ‚ÄúKiss, Marry, Kill‚Äù. Speaking with AfterBuzz TV, Kelce was given the options of Swift, Katy Perry and Ariana Grande. He said he‚Äôd ultimately kill Grande, marry Perry and kiss Swift. That was about six years ago, but it has more recently set tongues wagging as fans wondered how long the plan for them to meet has been in the works. Cruel Summer Fast-forward seven years, and things started to heat up. In July, speaking on the podcast he shares with his brother, New Heights, Kelce said he intended to give Swift a friendship bracelet with his number on it during her Eras Tour concert in Kansas City. Unfortunately, the bracelet never made it to her wrist or his digits to her phone.

‚ÄúI was disappointed that she doesn‚Äôt talk before or after her shows because she has to save her voice for the 44 songs she sings,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúShe doesn‚Äôt meet anybody, or at least she didn‚Äôt want to meet me, so I took it personal[sic].‚Äù At this point, it seems like any attraction between the two was one-sided. Kelce‚Äôs attempts to make proper contact with Swift at the show ultimately failed. Was she just not that into him? But Kelce, exhibiting the tenacity typical of a professional sportsman, remained determined to get her attention. Wildest Beards The Kelce brothers couldn‚Äôt stop talking about Swift, even though she‚Äôd left Travis hanging at the concert. Swift‚Äôs name began popping up everywhere on the podcast, including during conversations about... facial hair?

In August, the brothers discussed Kelce‚Äôs moustache, which he grows every year in honour of the Chief‚Äôs head coach, Andy Reid. When asked if he knew what Swift thought of the ‚Äôstache, he remained cheekily confident. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre not going to bring up Taylor Swift in this episode,‚Äù he says, ‚ÄúBut something tells me she‚Äôs going to like it.‚Äù There was a clear suggestion Kelce had made contact with Swift, and was even going to meet her. Shortly after that remark, Kelce took a week off training to visit New York City, according to Vulture. Coincidentally, this happened to be while Swift was re-recording her 1989 tracks in the city. Welcome to New York

The suspicion the two were actually spending time together in New York was seemingly confirmed in September when it was reported they had been ‚Äúquietly hanging out‚Äù for months. This was the first, albeit tentative, confirmation from the media rather than from amateur Swiftie sleuths on social media. So, it was only a matter of time before it entered the cultural zeitgeist. Blank Space Which it did, very quickly. On September 17, Kelce scored a touchdown against the Jaguars, triggering CBS announcer Ian Eagle to reference Swift‚Äôs 2014 hit, Blank Space.

‚ÄúKelce finds a blank space for the score,‚Äù Eagle said, poking fun at Kelce‚Äôs newfound Swiftie status. And Eagle wasn‚Äôt the only one, with NFL Network‚Äôs Rich Eisen including a slew of lyric references during a preshow, including ‚Äúshake it off‚Äù, ‚Äúanti-hero‚Äù and ‚Äúall too well‚Äù. Kelce even acknowledged the tongue-in-cheek banter, commenting on a montage video of the preshow that Eisen posted to Instagram. ‚ÄúWell played Rich ‚Ä¶ Well played,‚Äù he wrote. Suddenly, football fans and Swifties were living through this surprising collision. Swift lyrics were infiltrating NFL game commentary, and her fans were furiously becoming football experts. All that needed to happen was for Swift herself to infiltrate a game, determining once and for all whether there was anything to these rumours or not. This Is Me Trying

On September 21, Kelce announced on The Pat McAfee Show he had invited Swift to watch one of his games. ‚ÄúI told her, ‚ÄòI‚Äôve seen you rock the stage in Arrowhead, you might have to come see me rock a stage at Arrowhead and we can see which one‚Äôs a little more lit,‚Äô‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôll see what happens in the near future.‚Äù Were they finally about to hard-launch their friendship/potential romance to the world, laying all speculation to rest? Love Story This finally brings us to the fated sighting of Swift at Arrowhead Stadium on Monday, cheering on No. 87 with gusto.

The 12-time Grammy winner appeared to shout ‚Äúlet‚Äôs f‚Äîing go‚Äù after Kelce scored a touchdown before chest-bumping other Chiefs fans. Considering Swift is known for being an Eagles fan ‚Äì she‚Äôs originally from Pennsylvania and even references the team in Gold Rush ‚Äì her outward support for the Kelce‚Äôs team seemed extra telling. Swifties were immediately on high alert, with some capturing Swift and Kelce leaving the stadium together. If that wasn‚Äôt enough, extra observant fans were able to note that Kelce‚Äôs blue and white post-game outfit was supposedly labelled the ‚Äú1989 bedroom painting set‚Äù, perhaps an intentional reference to Swift‚Äôs 2014 album, which she will be re-releasing in October. Swift‚Äôs penchant for Easter eggs must be rubbing off on the tight end player. As if this weren‚Äôt enough subtle references already, they were also spotted in a ‚Äúgetaway car‚Äù together outside the stadium ‚Äì potentially a nod towards her 2017 track. Could they have been driving off into the sunset? Of course, none of this actually confirms Swift and Kelce are actually dating. But regardless of whether it‚Äôs a friendship or a romantic relationship, it has sent shockwaves through two massive cultural franchises, expanding the NFL‚Äôs audience into uncharted territory. It‚Äôs a cultural pairing on par with ‚Äì and perhaps even bigger than ‚Äì Kim Kardashian and Kanye West.",When pop culture and sport collide: A timeline of Taylor Swift‚Äôs NFL takeover,https://www.theage.com.au/culture/music/when-pop-culture-and-sport-collide-a-timeline-of-taylor-swift-s-nfl-takeover-20230926-p5e7lu.html?ref=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_source=rss_culture,The Age

Travis Kelce has hilariously confessed that he attempted to delete some of his tweets before they went viral.

The 34-year-old football star spoke candidly about his previous posts on X - formerly known as Twitter - during an episode of his New Heights podcast with brother Jason Kelce, which aired on 22 November. The comments came after some of Kelce‚Äôs funny tweets from 2010 and 2011 resurfaced amid his rumoured relationship with Taylor Swift.

When Jason quipped that everyone is ‚Äúa big fan of college Travis on Twitter‚Äù, the Kansas City Chiefs star acknowledged that his posts weren‚Äôt really noticed back then. However, Kelce explained that he was trying to remove his tweets from social media even before they went viral.

‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs hilarious is that nobody followed me back then,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúBut I will say I have been trying to get all those tweets deleted. Like since I got into the league, I‚Äôm like: ‚ÄòGosh, I just want all those things to get deleted.‚Äô‚Äù

He poked fun at how his tweets are now being mocked, adding: ‚ÄúAnd sure enough, it came surface-level and everybody f***ing dove in, in 2011. What a f***ing year that was.‚Äù

The Philadelphia Eagles star continued to discuss the viral responses to his brother‚Äôs tweets. He even referenced how Jimmy Fallon and his band performed a song, titled ‚ÄúThe Ballad of Travis Kelce‚Äù, on The Tonight Show - in which the late-night host recited Kelce‚Äôs old tweets. The two brothers highlighted the now fan-favourite post, which reads: ‚ÄúI just gave a squirle a piece of bread and it straight smashed all of it!!!! I had no idea they ate bread like that!! Haha #crazy.‚Äù

Kelce later revealed the meanings behind some of his viral tweets, noting that he would simply share the remarks for fun. ‚ÄúI was just using Twitter like a diary. I‚Äôm just out here saying nonsense - ‚ÄòI just gave a squirrel a piece of bread‚Äô - and spelled squirrel like a jacka**,‚Äù Kelce said.

Jason mocked his brother for his spelling of ‚Äúsquirrel‚Äù in the tweet, before claiming that‚Äôs the reason why the post went viral in the first place. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm only spelling squirrel like that from now on, I don‚Äôt know why it‚Äôs spelled the other way,‚Äù he joked. ‚ÄúThis one gets crushed, but I think the only reason it‚Äôs getting crushed is because of the spelling. Outside of that, if I‚Äôm throwing bread around and a squirrel is eating it I‚Äôd be pretty pumped up.‚Äù

Earlier this month, fans of the A-list couple took to X to share screenshots of some of Kelce‚Äôs old tweets - including one post from 2010 that reads: ‚Äú#Chipotle will always be a great choice!!!!‚Äù

The NFL player‚Äôs tweets have unsurprisingly resurfaced amid his relationship with Swift, who he‚Äôs been romantically linked to since the summer. The dating speculation first began in July, when Kelce confessed that he tried and failed to give Swift a friendship bracelet with his number on it during her Eras Tour show. On his podcast, he later invited the ‚ÄúAnti-Hero‚Äù singer to one of his games at Arrowhead Stadium - an invitation she famously accepted on 24 September. Since then, Swift has attended three more of Kelce‚Äôs games.

Kelce showed his support for Swift when he attended her Eras Tour show in Buenos Aires, Argentina, on 11 November. During the concert, Swift gave a shout-out to the Chiefs player when she changed her ‚ÄúKarma‚Äù lyrics to reflect their relationship. ‚ÄúKarma is the guy on the Chiefs, coming straight home to me,‚Äù she sang, letting out a laugh as fans in the audience screamed in response. The ‚ÄúAll Too Well‚Äù singer was later seen running into his arms and kissing the NFL player following the concert, as he whisked her away backstage.

In an interview withWSJ Magazine published on 20 November, Kelce described how much he admires Swift‚Äôs skills as a musician. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve never been a man of words. Being around her, seeing how smart Taylor is, has been f***ing mind-blowing. I‚Äôm learning every day,‚Äù he explained.

Although he acknowledged the public attention his personal life has received because he‚Äôs ‚Äúnever dated anyone with that kind of aura around them,‚Äù Kelce specified that he‚Äôs not letting the media affect his relationship.

‚ÄúBut at the same time, I‚Äôm not running away from any of it,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúThe scrutiny she gets, how much she has a magnifying glass on her, every single day, paparazzi outside her house, outside every restaurant she goes to, after every flight she gets off, and she‚Äôs just living, enjoying life.

‚ÄúWhen she acts like that I better not be the one acting all strange.‚Äù",Travis Kelce says he tried to delete his ‚Äònonsense‚Äô tweets before they went viral,https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/taylor-swift-travis-kelce-tweets-b2453410.html,The Independent - Life and Style

Taylor Swift has officially been named Time‚Äôs 2023 Person of the Year.

On Wednesday 6 December, the magazine announced Swift had earned the honour after an ‚Äúeditors‚Äô assessment of the individual who most shaped the headlines over the previous 12 months, for better or for worse‚Äù.

The recognition of Swift comes on the heels of a whirlwind year for the popstar, whose Eras Tour dominated ticket sales in 2023. ‚ÄúThis is the proudest and happiest I‚Äôve ever felt, and the most creatively fulfilled and free I‚Äôve ever been,‚Äù Swift told Time. ‚ÄúUltimately, we can convolute it all we want, or try to overcomplicate it, but there‚Äôs only one question... Are you not entertained?‚Äù

Swift was chosen among a strong list of contenders, including Chinese President Xi Jinping, King Charles III, the live-action Barbie movie, and Vladimir Putin. ‚ÄúWhile her popularity has grown across the decades, this is the year that Swift, 33, achieved a kind of nuclear fusion: shooting art and commerce together to release an energy of historic force,‚Äù the magazine said about its selection.

This year alone, Swift has broken records with her career-spanning Eras Tour, which is estimated to have grossed over $1.4bn. Her concert film, the Eras Tour movie, has surpassed $250m at the global box office since its opening weekend in October. Not to mention her rumoured relationship with Kansas City Chiefs tight end Travis Kelce caused a 400 per cent spike in NFL jersey sales.

Since her first NFL appearance in September, Swift‚Äôs occasional attendance at Kelce‚Äôs games has received pushback from NFL fans who believe her presence is distracting from the game itself. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm just there to support Travis,‚Äù Swift admitted. ‚ÄúI have no awareness of if I‚Äôm being shown too much and pissing off a few dads, Brads, and Chads.‚Äù

She playfully added: ‚ÄúFootball is awesome, it turns out. I‚Äôve been missing out my whole life.‚Äù

The ‚ÄúBad Blood‚Äù singer revealed that their romance began when Kelce gave her shoutout on his podcast, admitting he attempted to give Swift his phone number after one of her Eras Tour shows. The pair immediately began ‚Äúhanging out‚Äù and by the time she attended her first Chiefs game in September, they were already a couple. ‚ÄúI think some people think that they saw our first date at that game? We would never be psychotic enough to hard launch a first date,‚Äù Swift joked.

Back in April, it was revealed that Swift and British actor Joe Alwyn had broken up after six years of dating. The former couple were notoriously private, as the Conversations with Friends star previously expressed he didn‚Äôt want to discuss their relationship because it ‚Äúfeeds into a weird part of the culture‚Äù.

Now, Swift has shared that she has nothing to hide in her new relationship with Kelce. ‚ÄúWhen you say a relationship is public, that means I‚Äôm going to see him do what he loves, we‚Äôre showing up for each other, other people are there and we don‚Äôt care,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúThe opposite of that is you have to go to an extreme amount of effort to make sure no one knows that you‚Äôre seeing someone. And we‚Äôre just proud of each other.‚Äù

Speaking to Time, Swift detailed exactly how much work went into preparing for her Eras Tour - where each concert spans over 180 minutes, with more than 40 songs from at least nine albums and 16 costume changes. ‚ÄúEvery day I would run on the treadmill, singing the entire set list out loud,‚Äù she told the outlet. ‚ÄúFast for fast songs, and a jog or a fast walk for slow songs.‚Äù

She also stopped drinking and underwent three months of dance training, something that she admitted is ‚Äúnot my strong suit‚Äù. After she plays a run of shows, Swift said she takes a day to rest and recover before taking the stage once again. ‚ÄúI do not leave my bed except to get food and take it back to my bed and eat it there,‚Äù she revealed. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a dream scenario.‚Äù

Most recently, a heat wave in Brazil forced Swift to postpone the second night of her Eras Tour shows in Rio de Janeiro. The decision came after one of the singer‚Äôs fans, 23-year-old Ana Clara Benevides, died from a cardiac arrest during Swift‚Äôs first performance in the country. Swift explained to Time that ‚Äúpart of my identity as a human‚Äù is putting on a show for her fans, no matter the circumstances. ‚ÄúI know I‚Äôm going on that stage whether I‚Äôm sick, injured, heartbroken, uncomfortable, or stressed,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs part of my identity as a human being now. If someone buys a ticket to my show, I‚Äôm going to play it unless we have some sort of force majeure.‚Äù

Perhaps it was her decision to re-record her music catalogue that catapulted Swift into such success. When music mogul Scooter Braun aquired Swift‚Äôs longtime label, Big Machine Records, in 2019, he also gained the rights to the master recordings of Swift‚Äôs first six studio albums. In November 2020, Braun sold the masters to an investment fund in a deal that was believed to be over $300 million. Since then, Swift has released four ‚ÄúTaylor‚Äôs Version‚Äù albums: Fearless (Taylor‚Äôs Version) in April 2021, Red (Taylor‚Äôs Version) in November 2021, Speak Now (Taylor‚Äôs Version) in July 2023, and 1989 (Taylor‚Äôs Version) in October 2023.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not lost on me that the two great catalysts for this happening were two horrendous things that happened to me,‚Äù Swift said, when asked about the success of her tour. ‚ÄúThe first was getting cancelled within an inch of my life and sanity. The second was having my life‚Äôs work taken away from me by someone who hates me.‚Äù

While Swift is arguably more famous now than ever before, the Grammy winner revealed that the constant attention and swarms of paparazzi won‚Äôt stop her from living her life. There‚Äôs also constant rumours surrounding her personal life, specifically rumours about her relationship with Alwyn that her publicist, Tree Paine, was forced to publicly deny.

‚ÄúOver the years, I‚Äôve learned I don‚Äôt have the time or bandwidth to get pressed about things that don‚Äôt matter,‚Äù Swift told Time. ‚ÄúYes, if I go out to dinner, there‚Äôs going to be a whole chaotic situation outside the restaurant. But I still want to go to dinner with my friends.

‚ÄúLife is short. Have adventures. Me locking myself away in my house for a lot of years - I‚Äôll never get that time back,‚Äù she added. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm more trusting now than I was six years ago.‚Äù",Taylor Swift is Time‚Äôs Person of the Year,https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/taylor-swift-time-person-of-the-year-b2459419.html,The Independent - Life and Style

In her forthcoming memoir, The Woman in Me, Britney Spears is expected to reflect on some of the most pivotal moments in her life, including her relationships.

Over the years, the pop star‚Äôs love life has continued to make headlines. Most recently, her ex-husband Sam Asghari filed for divorce after only 14 months of marriage. Spears is also the mother of two children ‚Äì Sean, 18, and Jayden, 17 ‚Äì who she shares with her second ex-husband, Kevin Federline.

According to a press release for The Woman in Me, Spears‚Äô memoir is ‚Äúa brave and astonishingly moving story about freedom, fame, motherhood, survival, faith, and hope‚Äù. Spears‚Äô book is also expected to cover the high-profile legal battle to end her conservatorship, which was dissolved in November 2021 after 13 years.

Throughout her time in the spotlight, specifically during the ‚Äò90s and 2000s, Spears has been in some heavily publicised romances. Unsurprisingly, fans are anticipating that Spears will detail some of her relationships in The Woman in Me, which is set for release on 24 October.

From Justin Timberlake to her now ex-husband Sam Asghari, here‚Äôs everything we know about Britney Spears‚Äô relationships and rumoured romances.

Justin Timberlake: 1998 to 2002

Spears‚Äô first highly public relationship was with her co-star in the Mickey Mouse Club, Justin Timberlake. The pair made many appearances together while dating, including the iconic moment Spears and Timberlake wore matching, all-denim outfits to the American Music Awards in 2001.

They broke up in 2002, shortly after Timberlake and his boy band NSYNC released their hit tune, ‚ÄúCry Me a River‚Äù. At the time, the music video for the song ‚Äì which featured a woman with blonde hair - sparked rumours that he and Spears broke up because she allegedly cheated on him.

Although the former couple never acknowledged the breakup rumours, the 2021 Framing Britney documentary addressed some of the public scrutiny that Spears faced during the 2000s. Following the documentary‚Äôs release, Timberlake came under criticism for the way he acted following his breakup with Spears.

He later issued an apology to Spears on Instagram, writing: ‚ÄúI‚Äôve seen the messages, tags, comments, and concerns and I want to respond. I am deeply sorry for the times in my life where my actions contributed to the problem, where I spoke out of turn, or did not speak up for what was right. I understand that I fell short in these moments and in many others and benefited from a system that condones misogyny and racism.‚Äù

In June 2021, he also shared his support for Spears after she testified publicly in a bid to end her conservatorship, which was controlled by her father, Jamie Spears. In a Los Angeles court hearing at the time, Spears alleged that she had been forced to take lithium against her will. She also claimed that the team managing her conservatorship had prevented her from having another baby by refusing to remove her IUD.

‚ÄúAfter what we saw today, we should all be supporting Britney at this time. Regardless of our past, good and bad, and no matter how long ago it was,‚Äù Timberlake wrote on X, formerly known as Twitter. ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs happening to her is just not right. No woman should ever be restricted from making decisions about her own body.‚Äù

Wade Robson: 2001 to 2002

Shortly after her breakup from Timberlake, Spears was rumoured to be dating Wade Robson, a dancer and choreographer who appeared in the music video for her 2009 tune, ‚Äú(You Drive Me) Crazy‚Äù. However, neither Spears nor Robson confirmed these rumours.

Colin Farrell: 2003

Back in 2003, Farrell and Spears made headlines when they were spotted holding hands at the premiere of The Recruit, sparking speculation that they were dating. However, during an interview with Entertainment Tonight at the time, the actor specified that he and the singer were just friends.

‚ÄúShe‚Äôs just a mate,‚Äù Farrell told the outlet, as reported by People in 2003. ‚ÄúSeriously, we just met a week ago, [we‚Äôre] having a laugh.‚Äù

Jason Alexander: 2004

Jason Alexander was Spears‚Äô first husband, tying the knot at a wedding chapel in Las Vegas in 2004. However, only 55 hours after the nuptials, they annulled the marriage.

In 2022, Alexander made headlines when he tried to attend Spears‚Äô wedding to Asghari, as could be heard saying in a video that he was going to crash the nuptials. ‚ÄúShe‚Äôs my first wife, my only wife,‚Äù Alexander reportedly told security. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm her first husband, I‚Äôm here to crash the wedding.‚Äù

After he was arrested for trespassing, vandalism, and battery, a security guard later revealed in court that when Alexander crashed the wedding, he also tried to enter Spears‚Äô bedroom.

Kevin Federline: 2004 to 2007

Kevin Federline and the ‚ÄúGimme More‚Äù singer first met at a club in 2004, before they went on to start their relationship. After just three months of dating, the two tied the knot in September of that year during a surprise wedding ceremony. Weeks before their one-year wedding anniversary, they welcomed their first child, son Sean Preston.

In 2006, they welcomed their second son, Jayden James. At the time, Federline was already a father to his daughter Kori Madison, now 20, and son Kaleb Michael, 18, with ex-fianc√©e Shar Jackson.

Spears went on to file for divorce from Federline in November 2006, citing ‚Äúirreconcilable differences‚Äù as the reason for their split. In the couple‚Äôs initial divorce settlement, they were granted joint legal and physical custody over their two children. While it appeared they were on good terms after their separation, things took a turn in 2018 when Federline requested an increase of $20,000 a month more child support payments from Spears.

After months of court discussions, Federline rejected Spears‚Äôs child support proposal and instead doubled his request to $40k a month. A settlement was finally reached between the two parties in September 2018, with Spears increasing her child support payments to Federline from $20,000 to $35,000 a month.

Federline has since moved on from the relationship, as he married volleyball player Victoria Prince in 2013. They now share two daughters, Jordan, 10, and Peyton, eight.

Adnan Ghalib: 2007 to 2008

Spears met British paparazzo Adnan Ghalib in 2007, shortly after she decided to shave her hair off in front of approximately 70 photographers. They only dated for about a year, as the relationship ended in 2008.

In the 2021 Netflix documentary, Britney vs Spears, Ghalib spoke candidly about the romance, claiming: ‚ÄúIt was a very simple, very easy relationship, you know? But between her fans and everybody else, it was like I was the bad guy.‚Äù

The former couple split in 2008 after Ghalib reportedly pulled a pregnancy test-buying stunt for publicity. In 2009, Jamie Spears filed a restraining order against Ghalib, which ordered the photographer to stay away from the singer and her family until 2012.

Jason Trawick: 2009 to 2013

Spears and Jason Trawick, a Hollywood agent who worked at WME, started dating in 2009 before getting engaged in December 2011. However, they called off their engagement in January 2013 and announced they were going their separate ways.

""Jason and I have decided to call off our engagement. I‚Äôll always adore him and we will remain great friends,"" Spears said in a statement sent by her representative to ABC News.

Trawick also issued a statement at the time, saying: ‚ÄúAs this chapter ends for us a new one begins. I love and cherish her and her boys and we will be close forever.""

David Lucado: 2013 to 2014

Two months after ending her engagement with Trawick, Spears started dating David Lucado, who worked at a legal firm. In August 2014, Spears announced their split, tweeting: ‚ÄúAhhhh the single life!‚Äù At the time, her representative also confirmed to People: ‚ÄúYes, she‚Äôs single.‚Äù

The news of the breakup came asTMZ alleged that Lucado had cheated on Spears, with claims that her father had purchased a video of the infidelity incident. The publication later alleged that Lucado denied the cheating allegations, with claims that he was seeing the other woman while he and Spears were broken up.

Despite their seemingly rocky history, Lucado showed his support for his ex in a 2016 interview with theNew York Times about her conservatorship. Speaking to the publication, he said: ‚ÄúIf anyone knew the real Britney, they would know that she would rather be remembered for being the great mother she is rather than the artist she is.‚Äù

The publication also noted that Lucado denied the infidelity claims from Spears‚Äô father, before he added: ‚ÄúAnd if anyone could see her interactions with her kids, they would know that there is no need for a conservatorship over Britney‚Äôs personal life.‚Äù

Charlie Ebersol: 2014 to 2015

Spears and Charlie Ebersol, who is known as the co-founder of Tempus Ex Machina and The Company, started dating in 2014. While their relationship was fairly low profile, Spears previously opened up about why she was drawn to Ebersol in the first place.

‚ÄúThere was something about him that made me feel really peaceful and at ease. And he was really hot, too. Adorably hot,‚Äù she told People at the time.

They officially broke up in June 2015 after eight months of dating.

The pair first met in 2016 when Asghari was cast as Spears‚Äô love interest in the music video for her song, ‚ÄúSlumber Party‚Äù, from her 2016 album Glory. They made their relationship Instagram official in 2017 and went on to support each other through different milestones - including the 29th annual GLAAD Media Awards, where Spears accepted the Vanguard Award for her work promoting equality and acceptance.

In April 2022, Spears announced she was pregnant with her and Asghari‚Äôs first child together, and her third child. However, the following month, she said in a statement posted to Instagram that she had suffered a miscarriage. The couple wrote: ‚ÄúWe have lost our miracle baby.‚Äù

That June, they held their lavish nuptials at her home in California with a star-studded guest list, which included Selena Gomez, Paris Hilton, Drew Barrymore, and Donatella Versace - who designed Spears‚Äô wedding dress.

In August, months after Asghari shut down speculation about getting a divorce, TMZ claimed that he had confronted Spears about rumours she cheated on him. That same day, the fitness instructor officially filed for divorce, listing the date of separation as 28 July 2023 and citing ""irreconcilable differences"" as the reason for the split.

In a statement posted online, Asghari said: ‚ÄúAfter six years of love and commitment to each other my wife and I have decided to end our journey together. We will hold onto the love and respect we have for each other and I wish her the best always. S*** happens. Asking for privacy seems ridiculous so I will just ask for everyone including the media to be kind and thoughtful.‚Äù

Days before Spears‚Äô memoir release date, Asghari revealed that he had obtained an early copy of the book. In an interview with TMZ on 13 October, he explained that he wasn‚Äôt worried about anything being written in the book that could paint him in a negative light.

‚ÄúI already read it and I‚Äôm very proud of her,‚Äù he told the outlet. ‚ÄúShe put a lot of work into it, and it was very hard. I‚Äôm definitely excited, and I‚Äôm extremely proud of her. It was a very tough one [to write].‚Äù

entertainment,Laura Snapes,2023-10-24T18:37:25+00:00,"She has never really known freedom

As a child, Britney escaped her difficult home life ‚Äì her alcoholic father often rowing with her mother ‚Äì into the outdoors, which ‚Äúgave me a sense of aliveness and danger‚Äù, she writes. Performing also makes her feel invincible. But by the age of 16, she is public property ‚Äì incapable of going outside without being mobbed, and her love of singing and dancing now a lucrative resource.

By the time of her second album, she wants for so little: skinny-dipping with her dancers after playing Rock in Rio in January 2001 is one of her happiest memories. ‚ÄúIt was a taste of rebellion and freedom, but I was just having fun and being a 19-year-old,‚Äù she writes. After her split from Justin Timberlake, she dreams about quitting pop and opening a shop: ‚ÄúWith the gift of hindsight I can see that I hadn‚Äôt given myself enough time to heal from the breakup,‚Äù she writes ‚Äì though her requests for a break are not only turned down, but interpreted as a potential sign of sedition to be quashed and interrogated.

In this restrictive environment, small kindnesses take on an outsized significance, like Paris Hilton encouraging her ‚Äúto have fun for the first time in a long time‚Äù, leading to some infamous nights out with the heiress and Lindsay Lohan. Once again, Britney is seen as stepping out of bounds, potentially damaging her earning potential. One night she has her mother babysit her sons; when she returns home tipsy, Lynne Spears screams at her, she writes. ‚ÄúThe shame I felt killed my heart. I stood there, reeling, and thought, OK, I guess it‚Äôs forbidden for me to party.‚Äù As the restrictions get tighter, Britney acts out ‚Äì and ends up legally denied her freedom for 13 years, under a conservatorship controlled by her father.

Her body felt like public property

From day one, Britney‚Äôs body is made fair game. Between the videos for her debut single, Baby, One More Time and Sometimes, the media noted her changing physique and concluded that the 16-year-old must have had breast implants ‚Äì rather than simply going through puberty. She notices that talkshow hosts ask her about her chest, while her boyfriend Justin Timberlake gets asked serious questions about his music. It‚Äôs one of many pressures that ultimately push her to breaking point, and when she writes about shaving her head in a salon in 2007, she frames it as a ‚Äúfuck you‚Äù to the impossible beauty standards she felt forced to live up to: ‚ÄúI‚Äôd smiled politely while TV show hosts leered at my breasts, while American parents said I was destroying their children by wearing a crop top.‚Äù

That brief moment of freedom doesn‚Äôt last long: a year later, she is ambushed into the conservatorship, which also exercises jurisdiction over her body. ‚ÄúNo matter how much I dieted and exercised, my father was always telling me I was fat,‚Äù she writes. Punishing gym routines leave her feeling ‚Äúout of my mind‚Äù. Her diet is monitored ‚Äì along with every other detail of her life ‚Äì while she goes through the motions of her Las Vegas residency. ‚ÄúMy body was strong enough to carry two children and agile enough to execute every choreographed move perfectly onstage. And now here I was, having every calorie recorded so people could continue to get rich off my body.‚Äù

Here I was, having every calorie recorded so people could continue to get rich off my body

On the other side of the conservatorship, she writes, freedom looks like being able to gain weight without anyone ‚Äúshouting at me‚Äù. It‚Äôs eating chocolate again. It‚Äôs posting selfies ‚Äì either nude or clothed ‚Äì on Instagram. Some people don‚Äôt understand the latter, she writes, ‚Äúbut I think if they‚Äôd been photographed by other people thousands of times, prodded and posed for other people‚Äôs approval, they‚Äôd understand that I get a lot of joy from posing the way I feel sexy and taking my own picture, doing whatever I want with it.‚Äù

Her ‚Äòvirginity‚Äô was a prison

Britney was actively marketed as a virgin, a repulsive, archaic premise that made the 16-year-old‚Äôs inevitable sexuality into a kind of timebomb. In fact, she writes happily, she first slept with her older brother‚Äôs best friend when she was 14. Yet the fixation on her ‚Äúpurity‚Äù took ‚Äúthe focus off me as a musician and a performer‚Äù, she writes. ‚ÄúAll some reporters could think of to ask me was whether or not my breasts were real (they were, actually) and whether or not my hymen was intact.‚Äù

When Timberlake tells the world that she cheated on him, she is all but emblazoned with a scarlet letter. While she knows she is powerless against that narrative (‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think Justin realised the power he had in shaming me. I don‚Äôt think he understands to this day‚Äù), him telling the world that they had a sexual relationship was liberating. ‚ÄúTo be honest with you, I liked that Justin said that,‚Äù she writes. ‚ÄúWhy did my managers work so hard to claim I was some kind of young-girl virgin even into my 20s? Whose business was it if I‚Äôd had sex or not?‚Äù

But she still couldn‚Äôt escape the cycle that Timberlake set in motion: she describes her 2004 Onyx Hotel tour in the aftermath as ‚Äútoo sexual, for a start. Justin had embarrassed me publicly, so my rebuttal onstage was to kind of go there a little bit, too. But it was absolutely horrible.‚Äù

She has an immaculate sense of shade

Britney seems too pure of heart for active malice, but she has an immaculate way with a piercing characterisation. Timberlake‚Äôs band, ‚ÄòNSync, were big hip-hop heads, she writes, and sometimes ‚Äútried too hard to fit in‚Äù with Black artists. When Timberlake spots Ginuwine at an event, he ‚Äúgot all excited and said, so loud, ‚ÄòOh yeah fo shiz, fo shiz! Ginuwiiiine! What‚Äôs up, homie!‚Äô‚Äù

Her account of being encouraged to abort their pregnancy at home, lest anyone see them going in and out of hospital, is horrifying. Britney, with no pain relief, is writhing on the floor. Timberlake proves to be the last person you‚Äôd call in a crisis. ‚ÄúAt some point he thought maybe music would help, so he got his guitar and he lay there with me, strumming it,‚Äù she writes. Almost as embarrassing is husband Kevin Federline‚Äôs attempt to start a music career. ‚ÄúHe really thought he was a rapper now,‚Äù she writes, with the bafflement of someone who has never known pretension. ‚ÄúBless his heart ‚Äì because he did take it so seriously.‚Äù

Motherhood leaves her vulnerable

When Britney gets pregnant with her first son, she initially thinks it might protect her: ‚ÄúI wanted everyone to stay away: stand back! There‚Äôs a baby here!‚Äù Inevitably, it doesn‚Äôt work out that way. The paparazzi become aggressive, particularly once she has her kids in quick succession ‚Äì becoming pregnant a second time three months after giving birth to her first. She suffers from postnatal depression and feels hopeless about her ability to protect her sons: ‚ÄúI got a little depressed once I was no longer keeping them safe inside my body ‚Ä¶ I wanted them back inside me so the world couldn‚Äôt get at them.‚Äù

Every part of normal life had been stripped from me. I had no freedom and yet also no security

She has a keen sense of injustice regarding a perceived contract that she never signed with the public and the press. ‚ÄúThey just kept acting like I owed it to them to let the men who kept trying to catch me looking fat take photos of my infant sons.‚Äù Her postpartum body and shots of her without makeup were treated as ‚Äúsome kind of a sin ‚Äì as if gaining weight was something unkind I‚Äôd done to them personally, a betrayal. At what point did I promise to stay 17 for the rest of my life?‚Äù

What she knows now, she writes, ‚Äúis that every part of normal life had been stripped from me ‚Äì going out in public without becoming a headline, making normal mistakes as a new mother of two babies, feeling like I could trust the people around me. I had no freedom and yet also no security. At the time I was also suffering, I now know, from severe postpartum depression.‚Äù It left her suicidal. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll admit it, I felt that I couldn‚Äôt live if things didn‚Äôt get better.‚Äù

She knows she is trapped in a state of arrested development

It‚Äôs often said that famous people are frozen in time at the age they became famous, but Britney was never allowed to be a real child, nor a real adult. Her 2001 single I‚Äôm Not a Girl, Not Yet a Woman may be her most prescient recording; she is painfully conscious of this divide. After her split from Timberlake, she likens herself to Benjamin Button. ‚ÄúSomehow that year, in becoming more vulnerable I started to feel like a child again.‚Äù

The situation worsens amid postnatal depression. ‚ÄúIt was as if some part of me became the baby,‚Äù she writes in an apologetic section about transferring her frustrations on to her interior decorator. ‚ÄúOne part of me was a very demanding grown woman yelling about white marble, while another part of me was suddenly very childlike.‚Äù

When she is placed under the conservatorship, she not only regresses, but feels dehumanised by the constant scrutiny. ‚ÄúI became a robot. But not just a robot ‚Äì a sort of child-robot. The conservatorship stripped me of my womanhood, made me into a child.‚Äù It‚Äôs hard to explain, she says, ‚Äúhow quickly I could vacillate between being a little girl and being a teenager and being a woman, because of the way they had robbed me of my freedom ‚Ä¶ They wanted me to be wild onstage, the way they told me to be, and to be a robot the rest of the time.‚Äù

Music seems to have become an afterthought

Early on, Britney writes, she loved making music. She told the producer Max Martin that she wanted to sound more R&B than straight pop; she listened to Tainted Love the night before recording Baby, One More Time and stayed up late so that she would sound as gravelly and ‚Äúfried‚Äù as Marc Almond. She was a studio perfectionist who would stay in the booth for hours, and the school setting and uniforms of the Baby video were her idea. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs probably the moment in my life when I had the most passion for music,‚Äù she writes. ‚ÄúI was unknown and I had nothing to lose if I messed up.‚Äù

After that, her music barely gets a mention in A Woman Like Me. There‚Äôs a nod to her breaking records; the era-defining Toxic is dispensed with in a sentence. The only album that she goes into any kind of detail on is 2007‚Äôs cult favourite Blackout, made at the height of her public struggles yet full of potential. The studio was a refuge from the paparazzi hounding her outside; making a messy DIY video for the single Gimme More may be ‚Äúby far the worst video I‚Äôve ever shot in my life‚Äù, but the scrappiness meant ‚Äúmore interesting people started noticing and wanting to work with me‚Äù. There‚Äôs some later love for 2016‚Äôs Glory, and she writes proudly about her 2022 collaboration with Elton John, but says she has no plans to make music at the moment.

Her life under the conservatorship is a horror story

It feels fitting that The Woman in Me is being released a week before Halloween. No matter how much we already know about the 13 years that Britney lived under a conservatorship, her recounting of its imposition, life under it and her inability to escape it is nothing short of a horror story. It is appalling, like something out of a Victorian novel, not the very real experiences of a thirtysomething in the last decade.

When she fears that Federline is going to take away access to her kids, she locks herself in a bathroom with one of her sons. ‚ÄúBefore I knew what was happening, a Swat team in black suits burst through the bathroom door as if I‚Äôd hurt someone,‚Äù she writes, and she is subject to a forced hospital hold. Soon after, her mother invites her to her beach house because ‚Äúthe cops are after you‚Äù. When she arrives, so does another Swat team. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm a five-foot four-inch pop singer who calls everyone sir and ma‚Äôam,‚Äù she writes. ‚ÄúThey treated me like I was a criminal or predator.‚Äù

The conservatorship clamps down on her life, ruled by her father, who she alleges was ‚Äúan alcoholic, someone who‚Äôd declared bankruptcy, who‚Äôd failed in business, who‚Äôd terrified me as a little girl‚Äù. She is medicated and surveilled. Her dates are required to agree to background checks and blood tests, made to sign NDAs, and receive a full rundown of her sexual history before the first date. ‚ÄúThe insanity of this system kept me from finding basic companionship, having a fun night out or making new friends ‚Äì let alone falling in love,‚Äù Britney writes. ‚ÄúIt was just the worst thing that could possibly ever happen to my music, my career and my sanity.‚Äù

She accedes in order to retain access to her boys, but questions how she can perform at such a high level when she is perceived as ‚Äúso sick that I couldn‚Äôt make my own decisions‚Äù. She makes futile attempts to escape the arrangement; meanwhile her father sends her to rehab and Alcoholics Anonymous because she has been taking over-the-counter energy supplements. The women at AA inspire her to start trying to take control over her life but she just hits more walls. Her father won‚Äôt let her remove her IUD to start a family with her new boyfriend, later husband, Sam Ashgari (they have divorced since Britney completed the memoir). After she objects to a new dance move suggested for her Vegas residency, she is sent to a solitary rehabilitation facility for two months, the most upsetting part of the book.

Was I a bank robber? A wild animal? Why was I treated as though I were about to burn the place down and murder them all?

She is locked up, put on lithium, subject to relentless testing and mandatory therapy, can‚Äôt see her kids or dog, can‚Äôt bathe or dress in private or shut the door to her room, has set bed and waking times. For blood tests, ‚Äúthe tech drawing my blood would be flanked by the nurse, a security guard and my assistant. Was I a cannibal? Was I a bank robber? Was I a wild animal? Why was I treated as though I were about to burn the place down and murder them all?‚Äù She wonders if her family is trying to kill her. Made slow and sclerotic, ‚ÄúI began to feel like I was being ritually tortured,‚Äù she writes, feeling estranged from her own body. ‚ÄúIf the idea of my being in that place was to heal, that was not the effect.‚Äù

She‚Äôs not scared of anything after that experience, she writes, ‚Äúbut it doesn‚Äôt make me feel strong; it makes me sad. I shouldn‚Äôt be this strong.‚Äù

A nurse shows Britney the blossoming fan movement that is spreading awareness of its suspicions that all is not right with her conservatorship. Come June 2021, she calls 911 to report her father for conservatorship abuse days before a probate court hearing on the arrangement. ‚ÄúMy voice had been used for me and against me so many times that I was afraid nobody would recognise it now if I spoke freely,‚Äù she writes. When she is granted her freedom in November 2021, she says she feels shock, relief, elation, sadness and joy.

There is no love lost for her family

Britney writes about how she was always made to feel she was not enough as a kid; her father‚Äôs alleged alcoholism, neglect and brutal standards; how her mother always made her feel less-than. She is unsparing about her younger sister, who she characterises as a brat who was spared the pain of Britney‚Äôs impoverished childhood because of her success. ‚ÄúMy mom and I had to witness the ugliness and the violence without believing that there was anywhere else to go.‚Äù

Even once Britney is the biggest pop star in the world, her parents still seem to have an undue say in the running of her career, including making her sit for humiliating TV interviews ‚Äì why exactly that is remains unanswered. Her father seizes control legally with the imposition of the conservatorship, telling her, chillingly, ‚ÄúI am Britney Spears now,‚Äù and her family appear to live off her dime while she lives an extraordinarily restricted life.

When she returns home from the forced stint in a brutal rehab facility, she finds that her parents have thrown away her childhood things, including a binder full of her poetry. ‚ÄúI felt an overwhelming sadness. I thought of the pages I‚Äôd written through tears. I never wanted to publish them or anything like that, but they were important to me. And my family had thrown them in the trash, just like they‚Äôd thrown me away.‚Äù She resolves to start over with a new notebook. ‚ÄúIn that moment I made peace with my family,‚Äù she writes. ‚ÄúBy which I mean that I realised I never wanted to see them again, and I was at peace with that.‚Äù

Britney writes that she is working to feel ‚Äúmore compassion than anger‚Äù towards them. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not easy.‚Äù",‚ÄòI was being ritually tortured‚Äô: the most shocking moments in Britney Spears‚Äô memoir,https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/oct/24/britney-spears-memoir-most-shocking-woman-in-me,The Guardian

Will Smith has spoken out about his ‚Äútumultuous‚Äù relationship with his wife, Jada Pinkett Smith, while speaking to a crowd of fans in Baltimore, Maryland.

The 55-year-old actor took the stage at the Enoch Pratt Free Library on 18 October, as he made an appearance at a press event for his wife‚Äôs book, Worthy, alongside their two children ‚Äì Jaden, 25, and Willow, 22. His recent comments come after Jada made major revelations about their marriage in her memoir, including how she and Will have been separated for seven years.

During the event in Baltimore, Will began by speaking to the crowd about his love and admiration for his partner, who he married in 1997. ‚ÄúI just really wanted to come out and just be here and hold it down for you the way you have held it down for me,‚Äù he said during the event, as reported by The Baltimore Sun.

The King Richard star went on to describe the challenges and achievements he‚Äôs had throughout his marriage, adding: ‚ÄúWe have had a very, very long and tumultuous [relationship]. We call it ‚Äòbrutiful.‚Äô It was brutal and beautiful at the same time.""

At another point during the event, Will referred to his union with Jada as a ‚Äúsloppy public experiment in unconditional love,‚Äù according to the Baltimore Banner. He went on to explain that he‚Äôs ‚Äúhappier than [he‚Äôs] ever been in [his] entire life‚Äù and praised Jada for continuing to be by his side.

‚ÄúI have achieved every single thing I have ever wanted in my entire life. There is not one thing left that I desire in this world - all of the awards, all of the money, the family - everything I‚Äôve ever dreamed,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúAnd those dreams were largely built on the foundation of Jada‚Äôs sacrifices. There were many times when Jada put her career aside so I could follow the dreams of mine.‚Äù

The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air star thanked his wife for putting him ‚Äúbefore herself‚Äù and for maintaining a good relationship with his ex-wife Sheree Zampino. Will and Zampino share a 30-year-old son, Trey Smith, who was also present for the book event at the Enoch Pratt Free Library. Speaking to the crowd, Will said that Jada‚Äôs positive relationship with Zampino allowed all three of his children the chance to grow up together.

‚ÄúCan you show up and love somebody for the rest of your life, even when you don‚Äôt agree with them?‚Äù he asked. ‚ÄúJada is the best friend I have ever had on this planet and I am going to show up for her and support her for the rest of my life.‚Äù

This isn‚Äôt the first time that Will has opened up about his relationship, as it‚Äôs continued to make headlines. Earlier this week, he appeared to mock the publicity storm surrounding him and Jada in a video titled ‚ÄúOfficial statement‚Äù shared on Instagram. ‚ÄúSo, here‚Äôs the thing. My opinion is... uh‚Ä¶‚Äù the actor said, before sneezing into the crook of his arm. As he sneezed, the video comically zoomed out to show several different landscapes including lakes and mountains.

Prior to sharing the video, Smith showed his support for his partner and her success in a statement toThe New York Times. During the interview, the outlet noted that Smith said his wife‚Äôs memoir ‚Äúkind of woke him up‚Äù and that he has now realised she is more ‚Äúresilient, clever and compassionate than he‚Äôd understood‚Äù.

‚ÄúWhen you‚Äôve been with someone for more than half of your life, a sort of emotional blindness sets in, and you can all too easily lose your sensitivity to their hidden nuances and subtle beauties,‚Äù he added.

In an interview with People published on 10 October, Jada first revealed that she and her husband were living separately. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve been doing some really heavy-duty work together,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúWe just got deep love for each other and we are going to figure out what that looks like for us.‚Äù

However, during an appearance on the Today show on 16 October, Jada clarified to Hoda Kotb that she and the Suicide Squad actor are ‚Äúworking hard‚Äù and are ‚Äúconcentrating on healing‚Äù to get their relationship to a better place.

‚ÄúThere‚Äôs no finding another great love, and I think that‚Äôs the point,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs like we are in a place now that we are in a deep, healing space. And we are really concentrating on healing the relationship between us.‚Äù

The Girls Trip star continued: ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs no divorce on paper. We really have been working hard. That‚Äôs the whole thing. We are working very hard at bringing our relationship together. Back to a life partnership.‚Äù",Will Smith speaks to crowd about ‚Äòtumultuous‚Äô relationship with Jada Pinkett Smith,https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/will-smith-jada-pinket-marriage-b2432586.html,The Independent - Life and Style

Travis Kelce‚Äôs previous comments about having children have sparked controversy amid his ongoing romance with Taylor Swift.

The Kansas City Chiefs player, 34, first made the remarks about starting his own family during a February 2023 episode of his and his brother Jason Kelce‚Äôs podcast, New Heights. The episode resurfaced after a source claimed to Yahoo Entertainment that Swift and Travis Kelce ‚Äúhave talked about kids‚Äù within the next year.

In the episode of his podcast, the Philadelphia Eagles star asked his mother, Donna, which of her two sons she was ‚Äúrooting for,‚Äù as the Eagles and Chiefs were preparing to play against each other in the Super Bowl at the time.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôve said in the past to both of us that you root for me because I‚Äôve given you grandkids,‚Äù Jason, who shares three children ‚Äì Wyatt, four, Elliotte, two, and Bennett, seven months ‚Äì with wife Kylie Kelce, said. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve always known that you root for Travis. So who do you actually root for?‚Äù

After Jason asked his mother again who she was rooting for, ‚Äúif in a battle to the death,‚Äù Donna responded by asking who he‚Äôd pick to save if she and her husband, Ed Kelce, were stranded in the middle of the ocean. While Donna said she couldn‚Äôt pick which of her sons to root against, Jason then joked: ‚ÄúRemember if you choose me, Wyatt and Elliotte grow up without a father.‚Äù

Travis then chimed in to joke about wanting to start his own family. ‚ÄúI gotta start breeding,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve gotta start breeding, to all the breeders out there.‚Äù

Jason then responded to his brother‚Äôs remark with: ‚ÄúPlease don‚Äôt,‚Äù before Donna advised: ‚ÄúWait until you find the right person. Find the right person.‚Äù

However, Travis still doubled down on his plan, as he quipped: ‚ÄúI‚Äôm gonna find a breeder, and I‚Äôm gonna get kids so that mom can love me again.‚Äù

On X, formerly known as Twitter, fans have called Travis out for his seemingly sexist remarks and claimed that he shouldn‚Äôt have been referring to women as ‚Äúbreeders‚Äù.

‚ÄúForever grateful that Joe Alwyn kept to himself and is private,‚Äù one wrote, referring to Swift‚Äôs ex-boyfriend of six years.‚ÄúIt‚Äôs what makes Travis Kelce‚Äôs statements from earlier this year about ‚Äòfinding a breeder‚Äô cringe. You are free to say what you want but are not free from the consequences of doing so. Women are not objects.‚Äù

‚Äú‚ÄòStart breeding,‚Äô oh this is just f***ing disgusting and it‚Äôs setting us back so much,‚Äù another added. ‚ÄúWomen aren‚Äôt baby-making machines, women are more than the man they‚Äôre dating, we are more than marriage.‚Äù

‚ÄúAin‚Äôt a Swiftie but don‚Äôt have to be one to be weirded out about Travis Kelce calling women ‚Äòbreeders,‚Äô‚Äù someone else wrote. ‚ÄúThat ain‚Äôt it dude.‚Äù

Many other people went on to criticise claims about Swift and Travis having children soon, since the singer is about to return to her Eras Tour until November 2024.

‚ÄúWell I know for DAMN SURE that s*** about ‚Äòhaving kids within the next year‚Äô is NOT coming from Taylor‚Äôs side,‚Äù one claimed. ‚ÄúShe‚Äôs got the Eras Tour booked all through next year, and she‚Äôd rather die than cancel a show. But we do know who‚Äôs been public about looking for a ‚ÄòBREEDER.‚Äô‚Äù

The comments about Travis and Swift‚Äôs romance came days after they seemingly confirmed their relationship. On 22 October, Swift made her return to Arrowhead Stadium to watch as the Kansas City Chiefs won their game against the Los Angeles Chargers. The occasion marked Swift‚Äôs fourth time attending one of Kelce‚Äôs games, amid ongoing reports that they are dating.

Following the event, Chariah Gordon, the partner of Kelce‚Äôs teammate Mecole Hardman Jr, took to Instagram to share a snap of the singer and NFL player‚Äôs sweet PDA moment. In the picture, Swift could be seen standing next to Kelce, reaching to kiss his cheek.

In addition to the kiss, the football star also had the perfect reaction to a fan calling him Swift‚Äôs boyfriend. After a fan shouted: ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs go Taylor‚Äôs boyfriend‚Äù while Kelce was waiting for an elevator, he responded with a small smile on his face and by pumping his fist into the air.

Aside from their appearances at sports events, Swift and Kelce have also been photographed together on other occasions, including a date earlier this month in New York City after their surprise appearances on the season 49 premiere of Saturday Night Live. At the time, sources alleged to Entertainment Tonight that, during the date, Kelce got a little too close to Swift‚Äôs security personnel and allegedly told her bodyguard to step aside.

However, during an episode of his podcast, Kelce explained what he said to the security, and clarified that he didn‚Äôt push the bodyguard. ‚ÄúI placed my hand on the gentleman‚Äôs back to let him know I was behind him.

Sarah Michelle Gellar has taken umbrage with Roblox after her son‚Äôs account was hacked, forcing her to cancel her credit card.

The Buffy the Vampire Slayer star, 46, took to Instagram on 4 December after her son‚Äôs Roblox account was allegedly hacked. Gellar - who shares son Rocky, 11, and daughter Charlotte Grace, 14, with husband Freddie Prinze Jr - shared a screenshot from her iPhone, displaying a notification that her iCloud account ‚Äúhas been disabled‚Äù in the App Store and iTunes.

‚ÄúThis is what I‚Äôve been dealing with after my son‚Äôs @Roblox got hacked,‚Äù she wrote on her Instagram Story. ‚ÄúI had to cancel my credit card and now my life is basically cancelled.‚Äù

The Cruel Intentions actor added: ‚Äú@Roblox Why don‚Äôt you have better parental help?!?‚Äù

Roblox is a widely-popular online game platform that ‚Äúlets you play, create, and be anything you can imagine,‚Äù according to its description on the Microsoft Store. It allows players to customise characters and play minigames within the game. While Roblox is free to download on a number of platforms - including Android and iOS smartphones, Xbox game consoles, and Windows computers - players can also spend money on in-game items and customisations. According to TechCrunch, its millions of users range between ages eight and 18, although its key demographic is between nine and 15 years old.

Many social media users on X, formerly known as Twitter, were surprised by Gellar‚Äôs unexpected feud with the online gaming platform.

‚ÄúThis is the most important beef of 2023,‚Äù one person said, in response to Gellar‚Äôs Instagram Story post.

‚ÄúBuffy vs Roblox is where all this Millennial vs Gen Z discourse has been heading,‚Äù another user joked.

While one user agreed that ‚Äúbeing hacked on Roblox is life ruining,‚Äù someone else wondered why Gellar‚Äôs 11-year-old son was using his mother‚Äôs credit card in the first place. ‚ÄúOh please. That‚Äôs not that bad,‚Äù they said. ‚ÄúAnd I don‚Äôt know why parents let their children use their debit/credit cards on games, like, make them pay themselves!‚Äù

In a statement to The Independent, a Roblox spokesperson revealed the company is looking into Gellar‚Äôs complaint. ‚ÄúWe are looking into this case and we reached out directly to the user to help. We are committed to ensuring that our users have a positive experience on the platform,‚Äù they said. ‚ÄúIn partnership with safety groups, we‚Äôve developed tools and resources like our Parent & Caregiver Guide and other helpful resources for parents to have conversations with their kids and teens about staying safe, spending controls and protecting their account. Our support team works with parents and users directly 24/7 and can be contacted with questions here,‚Äù they added, including a link to its support page.

The Scooby-Doo star isn‚Äôt the only celebrity to publicly call out Roblox‚Äôs parental controls. In the season one premiere of The Kardashians, Hulu star Kim Kardashian went head to head with Roblox after her son Saint discovered what claimed to be unseen footage of her 2007 sex tape with her ex-boyfriend Ray J.

Saint, eight, was playing Roblox on a family member‚Äôs iPad when an icon of Kardashian‚Äôs infamous crying face popped up on his screen. When he showed his mother the icon, she pulled the iPad away after reading that the Roblox minigame had been registered under the username ‚ÄúKimsNewSexTape‚Äù.

The billionaire business mogul later shared in the episode that she planned on ‚Äúsuing‚Äù Roblox for using her name and likeness for a game. ‚ÄúI have all the time, all the money, and all of the resources to burn them all to the f***ing ground,‚Äù Kardashian said, adding: ‚ÄúThis is supposed to be unreleased footage from my old tape, this is the last thing I want as a mom, for my past to be brought up 20 years later.‚Äù

According to Polygon, the developer of the minigame was reportedly banned from the online platform when the episode aired in April 2022. In a statement to the outlet, a spokesperson from Roblox confirmed the existence of the game, but explained that the ‚Äúreferenced video was never available on our platform‚Äù.

‚ÄúThe referenced video was never available on our platform - we have strict moderation and policies to protect our community, including zero tolerance for sexual content of any kind which violates our Community Rules,‚Äù the spokesperson said. ‚ÄúThe text reference to the tape that got around our filters was quickly taken down and fortunately visible only to an extremely small number of people on the platform. We also swiftly took down the associated experience and banned the community developer involved with the incident.‚Äù",Sarah Michelle Gellar hits out at Roblox after her son‚Äôs account gets hacked,https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/sarah-michelle-gellar-roblox-hacked-b2458897.html,The Independent - Life and Style
entertainment,,2023-10-13T23:00:08+00:00,"Taylor Swift's biggest album 1989 returns with new tracks from the vault Published 27 October

Image source, Getty Images Image caption, Taylor Swift's 1989 tour sold 2.2m tickets and earned more than $250m at the box office

On Friday, Taylor Swift released a new version of 1989 - the biggest-selling album of her career, and the one that definitively turned her into a pop star.

Featuring hits like Shake It Off, Blank Space and Style, it was originally written during the 2013-14 Red Tour, with demos stored on her phone in a folder named ""Sailor Twips"".

Awarded a Grammy for album of the year, it has spent 325 weeks in the UK charts.

But now she has re-recorded it as the latest part of an ongoing campaign to regain control of her work, after an investment company bought her master tapes in 2019.

This is the biggest and riskiest part of the project. While earlier remakes were largely made with a live band, 1989's pop landscapes are full of squelchy, processed synths and treated vocals.

Fans can now find out how it has turned out - and hear five new tracks from the star's vault, expanding on the themes and relationships she explored on the original.

Here's a guide to all the songs and what Taylor has said about them.

1) Welcome To New York

""It's a new soundtrack, I could dance to this beat forever more.""

We open with a mission statement: The old Taylor can't come to the phone right now, she's dead.

After building her reputation in Nashville, 1989 jettisons the banjos in favour of insistent, needling beats and tales of bohemian nightlife. ""A farewell to twang,"" the New York Times called it.

Taylor knew change was necessary. ""I don't have the option of making music that sounds just like what I've done before,"" she told Popcrush. ""People will see right through it. They'll see that I was lazy"".

Her label begged her to add three country-leaning songs to the album, but she stood her ground.

""At a certain point, if you chase two rabbits, you lose them both.""

Welcome To New York itself is the sound of creative and personal freedom. Taylor moved to the city in 2014 and was amazed to discover she could go grocery shopping largely incognito.

""My friends and people who know me have commented that I'm physically different since being here,"" she told NYC radio station WKTU. ""That song is about the endless hopefulness and endless possibilities that New York seems to present,"" she added in an interview with Access Hollywood.

All proceeds from the track are donated to New York City's Public Schools.

2) Blank Space

Pretty much the perfect Taylor Swift song, Blank Space takes every horrible rumour that was being spread about her love life, and amplifies it with satirical relish.

""In the last couple of years the media have had a wonderful fixation on painting me as the psycho serial dater girl,"" she told the Grammy Museum. ""Every article was like, 'Here's Taylor Swift standing near some guy. WATCH OUT GUY!'

""My first reaction was to be like, 'That's a bummer. This isn't fun for me'. But my second reaction was, 'Hey, that's actually a really interesting character they're writing about: She jet-sets around the world collecting men - and she can get any of them, but she's so clingy that they leave and she cries in her marble bathtub surrounded by pearls'.

""I was like, 'I can use this'.""

Lyrically, it contains some of her best lines (""darling, I'm a nightmare dressed like a daydream"") and there's a delicious attention to detail - with a pen click signifying every new entry in her little black book.

Shout-out to all the lonely Starbucks lovers; and to Chicago indie band Hard Femme who took that misheard lyric and made it a real song. Those search engine clicks gotta be lucrative, right?

Image source, Getty Images Image caption, Many of 1989's songs were supposedly inspired by Taylor's relationship with Harry Styles

3) Style

An epic aural painting of windswept coastlines and propulsive wanderlust, Style is (supposedly) named for Harry Styles, with whom Taylor had a brief relationship in 2012.

Except she says it was inspired by fashion, and how certain items like a black dress or red lipstick will ""never go out of style"". That prompted her to write about the people who'll always be part of your life, even after the flame of romantic love wanes (all of which sounds like a classic piece of deflection to a probing journalist).

Whichever interpretation you prefer, the song marks a shift in Swift's psychology, as she briefly admits to having been unfaithful.

""I would never have said anything like that on a previous album,"" she told Ryan Seacrest.

""My previous albums have always been, 'I was right, you were wrong'. What happens when you grow up is you realise that the rules in a relationship are very blurred. It gets very complicated, very quickly.""

4) Out Of The Woods

One of 1989's strengths is how the music reflects the emotional tenor of the words. Here, that means frantic anxiety.

As Taylor and her partner run from forces that seek to destroy them, they're pursued by pounding drums and rushing synths. And there's a desperation to her voice, as though she's repeating ""everything's fine, everything's fine, everything's fine,"" against evidence to the contrary.

By the middle 8, it seems they've made a clean getaway. Then car brakes are slammed, and it's ""twenty stitches in a hospital room"".

In interviews, Taylor delighted in revealing this was based on a true story.

""It was almost like this very strange, subtle clue to the media that they don't know everything that happened in that relationship, and I can have something really major and traumatic happen to me and they don't know about it,"" she told NPR.

In her Rolling Stone cover story, Taylor said the crash actually occurred on a snowmobile ""with an ex who lost control and wrecked it so badly that she saw her life flash before her eyes"".

That prompted speculation the track was also about Styles: The couple had gone skiing with Justin Bieber and Selena Gomez in late 2012.

The lyrics also reference their identical aeroplane necklaces and a December break-up, which ties in with the ""Sad Taylor on a boat"" meme.

But the singer steadfastly refuses to name names: ""The fact that I've never confirmed who those songs are about makes me feel like there is still one card I'm holding,"" she told GQ.

5) All You Had To Do Was Stay

Traditionally, track five on a Taylor Swift album is the record's most raw and vulnerable moment - but All You Had To Do Was Stay is no Dear John or All Too Well.

Instead, it's a big disinterested ""nope"" to an ex who comes back begging for a second chance.

The song came to Taylor in a dream where her ex turned up at the door and, instead of giving him a piece of her mind, all that came out was a high-pitched plea to ""stay"".

When she woke, she recorded the sound into her phone and decided to base a song around it. Only this time, she got to say everything she wanted.

6) Shake It Off

Rattling like a bag of spanners, Shake It Off is a 21st Century Hey Mickey, a honking great party record with a chorus that drills so far into your brain you start seeing lights.

It was the last song recorded for 1989, and Taylor arrived at the studio with a challenge for her co-writers Max Martin and Johan ""Shellback"" Schuster: ""We need drums that make even the person who's having a terrible night at the wedding [go], 'Oh, it's my song!'""

Like Blank Space, Shake It Off is a response to celebrity takedown culture. Taylor lists all of her supposed flaws (""She's an airhead!' 'She dates too many men!"") with a defiant ""so what?"", sounding much less bothered than the girl who'd written Mean as a riposte to a snarky music critic three years earlier.

Released as 1989's first single, Taylor spent three days shooting a video, codenamed Project Sparrow, that built on the lyrical conceit.

""When I'm at award shows, I have the best time dancing [but] I'm really tall and lanky so I look a little bit like a baby giraffe learning how to walk,"" she told a group of young Swifties.

""So all over the internet, it's like,'Taylor Swift looks awkward when she dances'. And as soon as I wrote [Shake It Off] I knew I wanted to do an entire music video of me awkwardly dancing.

""I'm like, 'Yeah, I do dance awkwardly, but I'm having more fun than you.'""

Image caption, Taylor was one of the main stage headliners at Radio 1's Big Weekend in 2015

7) I Wish You Would

One of Taylor's many 2am songs, I Wish You Would, is powered by a choppy, unrelenting guitar line that mimics her thoughts as they race uncontrollably in the middle of the night.

She's pining for an ex, absent-mindedly driving down their street and wishing she'd never hung up the phone or broken things off.

But in real life, the story was reversed. Taylor told Rolling Stone the song was ""about an ex who bought a house two blocks from hers""; while a hidden message in the CD booklet said: ""He drove past her street each night.""

The mystery deepens.

8) Bad Blood

Bad Blood has the dubious distinction of taking last place in Rolling Stone's ranking of all 237 Taylor Swift songs.

It's certainly not her finest work - a vendetta disguised as a pop song, with a ham-fisted chorus that lacks her usual melodic instincts.

Swift hinted in a Rolling Stone interview that the track was about a high-profile female musician, saying the person did something ""so horrible"" that made them ""straight-up enemies.""

Although she tried not to identify the target, it became common knowledge that Katy Perry was in the crosshairs, after allegedly ""stealing"" Taylor's backing dancers just before a tour.

Perry confirmed the situation on James Corden's Carpool Karaoke, adding that she ""tried to talk to [Swift] about it and she wouldn't speak to me.""

The pop divas eventually reconciled in the 2019 video for You Need To Calm Down... but Taylor's still performing Bad Blood on her Eras tour.

Image source, Universal Music Group Image caption, The Bad Blood video featured an all-star ""squad"" of Taylor's female friends, including Cara Delevigne, Gigi Hadid, Cindy Crawford and many more

9) Wildest Dreams

Growing up means letting go of youthful optimism, and Swift confronts that notion several times on 1989.

On one hand, she's developed an ability to laugh off her critics; on the other, she seems increasingly jaded about love.

Here, she's imagining the end of a relationship before it's truly begun. When it all goes wrong, she asks her partner, ""Say you'll remember me / Standing in a nice dress / Staring at the sunset.""

""The way I used to approach relationships was very idealistic,"" she told Rolling Stone. ""I used to go into them thinking, 'Maybe this is the one - we'll get married and have a family, this could be forever'.

""Whereas now I go in thinking, 'How long do we have on the clock before something comes along and puts a wrench in it, or your publicist calls and says this isn't a good idea?""

Interestingly, an early draft of the lyrics had the couple fleeing the city and blotting out the pressures of the world, an idea which eventually resurfaced in I Know Places.

10) How You Get The Girl

What's that? An acoustic guitar? Surely not...

This is one of the few 1989 tracks you can imagine working as a country song, if it was stripped of its whip-crack snare drums and buzzing basslines.

Over that backing, Taylor turns agony aunt, dispensing advice on how to win back someone's heart... although her solutions (standing outside their house in the rain, bombarding them with cute photos) suggest she hasn't quite weaned herself off Love, Actually just yet.

""It's kind of a tutorial. All the steps you'd have to do to edge your way back into her life, because she's probably pretty mad at you"" she told Radio.com.

""If you follow the directions in this song, chances are things will work out‚Ä¶ Or you may get a restraining order.""

11) This Love

Taylor was beginning to experiment with different vocal styles on 1989, and the multi-tracked, semi-whispered performance on this track foreshadows the delicate sounds of the Folklore and Evermore albums.

The effect is almost aquatic, as though Taylor is drowning in the high tide she depicts in the opening verse. And that suits the song perfectly, with its theme of cutting someone adrift because they're not ready for a full relationship.

In an interview with the Scholastic book club, Taylor said the song originally started out as a poem in her journal.

""I just wrote it down, and closed the book and put it back on my nightstand, like, 'Oh, that was fun'.

""Then all of a sudden in my head, I started hearing this melody - and that's when I realised it was going to be a song.""

12) I Know Places

Continuing the theme of thwarted love, I Know Places was fuelled by Taylor's increasing anxiety over holding down relationships in the spotlight.

""I was like, 'No-one's gonna sign up for this. There are just too many cameras pointed at me, there are too many ridiculous elaborations on my life',"" she told the Grammy Museum.

""But I decided to write a love song [about] what would I say if I met someone really awesome and they were like, 'Hey, I'm worried about all this attention you get'.

""So I wrote this song about, 'Hey, I know all these places we could hide. We can outrun them'.""

Image source, Getty Images Image caption, The 1989 tour saw almost the entire album played every night

13) Clean

Co-written with indie-pop auteur Imogen Heap, 1989's original album closer is very much the palette cleanser its title suggests.

For once, the cavernous 1980s drums are swapped for the plucked keys of a Zimbabwean mbira, while a weary Taylor emerges from the ruins of a relationship.

And the song prompts one of her best lyrics - establishing drought as a metaphor for emotional desolation (""the flowers that we'd grown together died of thirst"") before she's reborn in the cleansing waters of a rainstorm: ""When I was drowning, that's when I could finally breathe / And by morning, gone was any trace of you, I think I am finally clean.""

The song is all about the necessity of pain, she told Popcrush.

""For most people that I've known who've fought through struggle, a lot them who have really just faced the pain head on have come out OK a lot faster than the ones who just pretended to be in denial of it.""

Image source, Getty Images Image caption, The star gave an Alice In Wonderland-themed performance at the 2013 Grammy Awards

14) Wonderland

""It's all fun and games til someone loses their mind.""

After dressing as the Mad Hatter at the 2013 Grammy Awards, Taylor returned to Lewis Carroll's Alice In Wonderland for this EDM-tinged banger.

The song describes a fling with a ""green-eyed"" man (Styles again?) with whom she ""fell down a rabbit hole"" where ""nothing's as it seems"" until, in the end, ""we both went mad"".

""Any song [on 1989] that is touching on a relationship issue is looking back on it, and discussing what I learned, rather than you did this and now I feel this way,"" she told Radio 1. ""There aren't any accusations made. There aren't any outright diss tracks.""

Originally a deluxe edition bonus track, Wonderland doesn't add anything new or insightful to the mix.

Even Taylor agrees it's a minor entry in her songbook: To date, she's only played it seven times in concert.

15) You Are In Love

A gently-sung romance, this was inspired by Taylor observing her producer Jack Antonoff and his then-girlfriend, Lena Dunham.

""I remember thinking [the backing track] sounded so much like the sound of actual love, true love. Like, through thick and thin, sickness and health love,"" she told MTV.

Drawing directly on conversations she'd had with Lena, the song blends scenes of everyday life (burnt toast, borrowed shirts) with moments of incandescent tenderness (kisses on sidewalks and late night heart-to-hearts).

In an interview with Elle, Taylor talked wistfully about the couple's ease around each other.

""I've never had that,"" she said. ""[But] now I have more of a grasp on the fact that when you're in a state of infatuation and you think everything that person does is perfect, it then - if you're lucky - morphs into a real relationship when you see that that person is not in fact perfect, but you still want to see them every day.""

Image source, Republic Records Image caption, Artwork for the re-recorded version of 1989 has a beach vibe, in contrast to the Polaroid aesthetics of the original

16) New Romantics

Proof that even Taylor gets it wrong: New Romantics, one of her most beloved songs, was originally held back as a bonus track.

It's a beast, though. An armour-plated anthem to resilience and power, where Taylor takes all the pain that's come her way and uses it to make herself bulletproof.

""Heartbreak is the national anthem, we sing it proudly,"" she declares, while glitterballs shatter around her. ""I could build a castle out of all the bricks they threw at me.""

That defiance also acts as a bridge to her next album, Reputation, which dismantled her critics, one-by-one. But that's for another article..

17-21) Tracks from the vault

In 2014, Taylor said she had recorded more than 100 songs for 1989 - so the relative scarcity of vault tracks is intriguing.

Whereas previous re-recordings have featured full discs of bonus material, this album gets just five new additions: Slut!, Say Don't Go, Now That We Don't Talk, Suburban Legends and Is It Over Now?

As a whole, they feel like dry runs for the songs that made the cut. The melodies aren't as crisp, the lyrics aren't as sharp. Suburban Legends has a particularly clunky line about letting a partner's indiscretions slide ""like a hose on a slippery plastic summer"".

Slut! has piqued fans' interest for its title alone - who might she be talking about? No-one, it turns out.

The song is thematically similar to Blank Space, commenting on the media's portrayal of Taylor's relationships: ""But if I'm all dressed up / They might as well be lookin' at us / And if they call me a slut / You know it might be worth it for once.""

The best of the new tracks is Is It Over Now. An angrier take on 1989's philosophical break-up songs, it calls back to the Harry Styles snowmobile incident (see also, Out Of The Woods) then, deliciously, references the ""Sad Taylor Boat"" meme - a photo of Taylor fleeing a vacation alone after the couple split up.

She goes on to call an ex a ""lying traitor"", accuses them of parading their new relationships in public, and noting that every new girlfriend looks like her.

""If she's got blue eyes, I will surmise that you'll probably date her.""

The fact that all the new songs were co-written and produced by Jack Antonoff suggests there may have been rights issues over the tracks she wrote with Max Martin - who has not been involved with the new re-recordings.

That means the vault tracks are all bathed in the dreamy, soft-focus atmospherics of Out Of The Woods, rather than the upfront pop of Shake It Off.

Speaking in 2015, Taylor admitted she'd been brutal about pruning songs from 1989's original tracklist.

""There were so many songs I wrote for this album that were really good, but if I felt in any way that they would have belonged on my last album, Red, they got cut,"" she told New York radio's The Todd Show in the Morning.

""There are really, really good songs on the cutting room floor because they weren't innovative enough or new enough. It's so weird to look back on that - you've got heaping piles of discarded songs that I really loved when I wrote them and I still love now.

""I just need each album to have its own sound and if it doesn't fit that sound, it doesn't matter if it's a great song to me.""",Taylor Swift's 1989: The stories behind her biggest album,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-66910595?at_medium=RSS&at_campaign=KARANGA,BBC News - Entertainment & Arts

Taylor Swift has revealed when her relationship with Travis Kelce really started.

The 33-year-old singer spoke candidly about the romance during a recent interview with Time after she was named the magazine‚Äôs 2023 Person of the Year. Speaking to the publication, she said she connected with Kelce in July, after he confessed on his podcast that he tried and failed to give her a friendship bracelet with his phone number on it during one of her Eras Tour shows.

‚ÄúThis all started when Travis very adorably put me on blast on his podcast, which I thought was metal as hell,‚Äù she explained. ‚ÄúWe started hanging out right after that. So we actually had a significant amount of time that no one knew, which I‚Äôm grateful for, because we got to get to know each other.‚Äù

Swift also confirmed that when she famously first attended Kelce‚Äôs game at Arrowhead Stadium in September, she was already dating the NFL star.

‚ÄúBy the time I went to that first game, we were a couple. I think some people think that they saw our first date at that game? We would never be psychotic enough to hard launch a first date,‚Äù she said.

The ‚ÄúBlank Space‚Äù singer also acknowledged that although her love life continues to make headlines with every Kansas City Chiefs game she attends, she‚Äôs focused on being there for her partner. She specified that she isn‚Äôt trying to hide her relationship from the public eye.

‚ÄúWhen you say a relationship is public, that means I‚Äôm going to see him do what he loves, we‚Äôre showing up for each other, other people are there and we don‚Äôt care,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúThe opposite of that is you have to go to an extreme amount of effort to make sure no one knows that you‚Äôre seeing someone. And we‚Äôre just proud of each other.‚Äù

During the interview with Time, the Grammy winner addressed how her appearances at Kelce‚Äôs games are heavily publicised. So far, she‚Äôs attended five of Kelce‚Äôs games, including one on 3 December, and she‚Äôs often seated in the Kelce family suite during the events.

‚ÄúThere‚Äôs a camera, like, a half-mile away, and you don‚Äôt know where it is, and you have no idea when the camera is putting you in the broadcast, so I don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôm being shown 17 times or once,‚Äù she said.

She explained that she doesn‚Äôt necessarily pay attention to the cameras and fans around her in those stadiums because she is watching her boyfriend play.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm just there to support Travis,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúI have no awareness of if I‚Äôm being shown too much and pissing off a few dads, Brads, and Chads.‚Äù

When discussing how many Swifties have now started watching NFL games since she started dating Kelce, she quipped about how much she likes the sport. ‚ÄúFootball is awesome, it turns out,‚Äù she joked. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve been missing out my whole life.‚Äù

Swift‚Äôs effect on the NFL didn‚Äôt go unnoticed in October, as one game between the Chiefs and New York Jets - which she attended with some of her famous friends - became the most-watched Sunday NFL show since the Super Bowl LVII in February 2023.

The ‚ÄúAll Too Well‚Äù singer‚Äôs interview with Time marks her first time publicly speaking out about Kelce, who she‚Äôs been romantically linked to since this summer, when the football tight end first confessed to attempting to give her his number.

While Swift has attended a few of Kelce‚Äôs games since their relationship started, he‚Äôs also gone on to support her career. In November, he made his way to Buenos Aires, Argentina, to attend one of her Eras Tour shows. During the concert, Swift gave a shout-out to the Chiefs player when she changed her ‚ÄúKarma‚Äù lyrics to reflect their relationship. ‚ÄúKarma is the guy on the Chiefs, coming straight home to me,‚Äù she sang, letting out a laugh as fans in the audience screamed in response.

After the show, the ‚ÄúStyle‚Äù singer was seen running into Kelce‚Äôs arms and kissing him, before he whisked her away backstage.

Elsewhere in the conversation with Time, the ‚ÄúAnti-Hero‚Äù singer said that she tries not to let the paparazzi get to her, even though so many of her outings with pals go on to make headlines. ‚ÄúOver the years, I‚Äôve learned I don‚Äôt have the time or bandwidth to get pressed about things that don‚Äôt matter. Yes, if I go out to dinner, there‚Äôs going to be a whole chaotic situation outside the restaurant. But I still want to go to dinner with my friends,‚Äù she said.

She emphasised how her perspective about the media has changed over the years, adding: ‚ÄúLife is short. Have adventures. Me locking myself away in my house for a lot of years - I‚Äôll never get that time back. I‚Äôm more trusting now than I was six years ago.‚Äù

With his love life in the public eye, Kelce has also opened up about his relationship with Swift. In an interview withWSJ Magazine, published on 20 November, he described how much he admires her skills as a musician. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve never been a man of words. Being around her, seeing how smart Taylor is, has been f***ing mind-blowing. I‚Äôm learning every day,‚Äù he explained.

However, he also acknowledged the heavy public attention around his private life as a result of his relationship, noting he‚Äôs ‚Äúnever dated anyone with that kind of aura around them‚Äù. But, according to Kelce, he‚Äôs not letting the media affect his relationship.

‚ÄúBut at the same time, I‚Äôm not running away from any of it,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúThe scrutiny she gets, how much she has a magnifying glass on her, every single day, paparazzi outside her house, outside every restaurant she goes to, after every flight she gets off, and she‚Äôs just living, enjoying life.

It may be over a decade since Britney Spears and Kevin Federline ended their marriage, but the former couple continue to have their ups and downs when it comes to co-parenting their two teenage sons, Sean Preston and Jayden.

Ahead of the release of the pop star‚Äôs memoir, The Woman in Me, which is due for release on 24 October, fans are anticipating Spears will share new details about her relationship with her second husband, Federline.

Spears has previously been open about her co-parenting struggles with Federline. Last year, he claimed their children were keeping their distance from Spears, who was embracing her newfound freedom following the end of her 13-year long conservatorship by posting several nude images on social media.

From marriage to divorce to co-parenting, here is a complete timeline of the drama between Britney Spears and Kevin Federline.

The ‚ÄúToxic‚Äù singer and the former backup dancer began their whirlwind romance back in 2004, when Federline worked as a backup dancer for Justin Timberlake. Federline recalled his first meeting with Spears to People back in 2008.

‚ÄúI met her at a club in Hollywood, Joseph‚Äôs. Our eyes met and that was it. We just hit it off right away,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúI learned real fast how much of a whirlwind the press and everything was.‚Äù

After just three months of dating, the two tied the knot in September 2004 during a surprise wedding ceremony in Studio City, California. Federline was 26 years old at the time, while Spears was just 22. Earlier that year, Spears was also married to her childhood friend Jason Alexander, but their marriage was annulled after just 55 hours.

The former couple welcomed their first child, son Sean Preston, weeks before their one-year wedding anniversary, and their second son Jayden James in 2006. At the time, Federline was already a parent to his daughter Kori Madison, now 21, and son Kaleb Michael, 19, with ex fianc√©e Shar Jackson.

Just eight weeks after the birth of their second child, Spears filed for divorce from Federline in November 2006, citing ‚Äúirreconcilable differences‚Äù. In the couple‚Äôs initial divorce settlement, which was finalised in July 2007, they were granted joint legal and physical custody over their two children.

Spears suffered a mental breakdown in 2008 and was placed on a 5150 psychiatric hold, leaving Federline to retain sole custody of their boys. In February of that year, Spears entered into a conservatorship with her father Jamie Spears, who took complete control over her assets.

Since Spears and Federline‚Äôs divorce, it seemed the two were amicably co-parenting their sons when they were seen supporting their boys at their soccer and football games. Federline moved on to his now wife Victoria Prince. The two share daughters Jordan Kay, 12, and Peyton Marie, nine.

In 2018, things took a turn when Federline requested an increase of $20,000 a month more child support payments from Spears. After months of court discussions, Federline rejected Spears‚Äôs child support proposal and instead doubled his request to $40k a month. A settlement was finally reached between the two parties in September 2018, with Spears increasing her child support payments to Federline from $20,000 to $35,000 a month.

Amid her father‚Äôs health crisis and ongoing emotional distress, Spears voluntarily checked into a mental health treatment facility in 2019. After hearing the news, Federline‚Äôs attorney Mark Kaplan told Entertainment Tonight: ‚ÄúKevin commends Britney for recognising that she needs to take a step back and that she is taking the reasonable steps to dealing with her situation in a responsible way. He wishes everyone well.‚Äù That same year, Federline was granted 70 percent custodial rights and Spears 30 per cent.

After years with her father in control of her finances and personal life, Spears was finally granted freedom from her conservatorship in November 2021. The singer made a powerful testimony at her conservatorship hearing that June, where she spoke out for the first time about her experience, calling for those involved to be ‚Äúput in jail‚Äù. Following the testimony, Federline expressed his support for the singer, saying he ‚Äúonly hopes the best for her because when the best for her is achieved, it‚Äôs the best for their kids.‚Äù

‚ÄúThe best thing would be for their mom to be healthy and happy,‚Äù his lawyer said in a statement at the time. ‚ÄúAnd if either of those things aren‚Äôt true, it doesn‚Äôt provide for the best setting for custody to be exercised.‚Äù

In June 2022, Spears married her longtime boyfriend Sam Asghari during an intimate ceremony at their Los Angeles home, just one month after the singer revealed she suffered a miscarriage.

While celebrities like Madonna, Paris Hilton, and Selena Gomez attended the festivities, Spears‚Äô close family ‚Äì her mother Lynne, father Jamie, sister Jamie-Lynn, and her two sons ‚Äì were not present at the nuptials.

Although their marriage last only 14 months, with Asghari filing for divorce in August this year, the actor and former dancer was previously praised by fans over his continuing support for Spears amid her conservatorship and custody battle.

In August 2022, Federline claimed during an interview with ITV that their teenage sons found it ‚Äútough‚Äù seeing their mother sharing nude photos online, saying: ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt imagine how it feels to be a teenager having to go to high school.‚Äù

Spears hit back at her ex-husband in a statement shared to her Instagram Stories responding to Federline‚Äôs ‚Äúhurtful‚Äù comments. ‚ÄúIt saddens me to hear that my ex husband has decided to discuss the relationship between me and my children ‚Ä¶ As we all know, raising teenage boys is never easy for anyone,‚Äù she wrote. ‚ÄúIt concerns me the fact that the reason is based on my Instagram ‚Ä¶ It was LONG before Instagram ‚Ä¶ I gave them everything ‚Ä¶ Only one word: HURTFUL.‚Äù

Asghari went on to accuse Federline of using their sons to ‚Äúvilify‚Äù his wife, and claimed her ex-husband‚Äôs ‚Äúgravy train will end soon, which probably explains the timing of these hurtful statements.‚Äù

‚ÄúThere is no validity to his statement regarding the kids distancing themselves and it is irresponsible to make that statement publicly,‚Äù Asghari wrote on Instagram.

Following Federline‚Äôs comments, Spears‚Äôs attorney Mathew Rosengart said in a statement obtained by Variety that Federline has created ‚Äúlegal issues‚Äù for himself, after posting private videos of Spears sternly speaking with her children without her consent.

‚ÄúWhether he realises it or not, Mr Federline has not only violated the privacy and dignity of the mother of his children, he has undermined his own children, whose privacy he should protect,‚Äù the statement read. ‚ÄúPutting aside his ITV interview, Mr Federline‚Äôs ill-advised decision to post an old video of his 11 and 12-year-old children was cruel, bottom of the barrel stuff. It was abhorrent.‚Äù

‚ÄúIn addition to demeaning himself and violating societal norms, he has now also created various legal issues for himself, including, but not limited to, implicating cyber-harassment and cyber-bullying statutes, among other things.‚Äù

Jada Pinkett Smith has revealed why she and her husband Will Smith never signed a prenuptial agreement before getting married.

The former talk show host, 52, spoke candidly about her husband during a recent interview with Parade. While discussing her new memoir, Worthy, Jada revealed that she and Will didn‚Äôt sign a prenup when they were married in 1997 because they knew divorce wasn‚Äôt in the cards for them.

‚ÄúListen, weddings are beautiful, but they can be very romanticised,‚Äù Jada said. ‚ÄúI feel that was a very real moment for the two of us to look each other in the eyes, recognise that there would be tough times in this journey and to say to each other: ‚ÄòNo matter what, we‚Äôre going to figure it out and that‚Äôs why we don‚Äôt need a prenup, because I‚Äôm making a promise that divorce won‚Äôt be necessary, that we will figure this out.‚Äô‚Äù

The Girls Trip star explained how she and Will casually promised not to get a divorce, and how that decision impacted their perspective on on marriage.

‚ÄúAnd we made that promise to each other without all of the bridal wedding beauty; it was just sitting on a log in his mother‚Äôs backyard, and going: ‚ÄòHey‚Äô - having to really look at the possibility of us not being together,‚Äù she said.

This isn‚Äôt the first time that Jada has opened up about her long-term commitment to her husband. During an interview with Hoda Kotb for Today, which aired on 13 October, the actor confirmed that she and her partner have been living ‚Äúcompletely separate lives‚Äù for the past seven years. However, according to Jada, their choice to live in separate homes doesn‚Äôt mean that they‚Äôll be getting divorced anytime soon.

‚ÄúI made a promise that there will never be a reason for us to get a divorce,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúWe will work through whatever. And I just haven‚Äôt been able to break that promise.‚Äù

When asked why she and Will didn‚Äôt ‚Äújust amicably divorce,‚Äù Jada simply replied: ‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt want to.‚Äù

She then explained how her family shaped that decision, as she and the King Richard star share two children - Jaden, 25, and Willow, 22. Will also has a 30-year-old son, Trey, who he shares with ex-wife Sheree Zampino. ‚ÄúWe love our family and we love each other. It‚Äôs more of a life partnership,"" Jada explained. ""Now, 10 years from now, Hoda, who knows?‚Äù

During a 2018 episode of her Facebook Watch series, Red Table Talk, Jada doubled down on her stance about divorce, as she recalled the the hard conversation she had with Will about the topic before they got married.

‚ÄúI told Will from the gate, I said let me tell you something: ‚ÄòIf you marry me, know this: we‚Äôre gonna be together. We‚Äôre going to be under the same roof,‚Äô‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúFor me personally, I‚Äôm not mature enough to have a divorce, I‚Äôm just not. I don‚Äôt think I would ever be mature enough, I don‚Äôt.‚Äù

The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air star has also shared similar sentiments, as he said during an appearance on the Ellen Degeneres Show that ‚Äúdivorce just can‚Äôt be an option‚Äù for him and Jada. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs really that simple. And I think that‚Äôs the problem with LA - there are so many options. So a huge part of the success for [Jada] and I is that we just removed the other options.‚Äù

Last week, Jada made headlines when she revealed that at the time of the 2022 Academy Awards, when Will slapped Chris Rock, she and her husband had been separated for six years. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve been doing some really heavy-duty work together,‚Äù she said during an interview with People. ‚ÄúWe just got deep love for each other and we are going to figure out what that looks like for us.‚Äù

Jada then praised her children for how they‚Äôve helped her grow, adding: ‚ÄúMy children, they‚Äôre little gurus. They‚Äôve taught me a deep sense of self-acceptance.‚Äù

On 16 October, Will broke his silence on his wife‚Äôs comments during an interview with the New York Times. The outlet noted that he said his partner‚Äôs memoir ‚Äúkind of woke him up‚Äù and that he has now realised she is more ‚Äúresilient, clever and compassionate than he‚Äôd understood‚Äù.

‚ÄúWhen you‚Äôve been with someone for more than half of your life, a sort of emotional blindness sets in, and you can all too easily lose your sensitivity to their hidden nuances and subtle beauties,‚Äù Will added.",Jada Pinkett Smith reveals why she and Will Smith never signed a prenup,https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/jada-pinkett-will-smith-prenup-b2430529.html,The Independent - Life and Style

Share All sharing options for: Twitch is the best way to watch sports, when you can actually watch sports on Twitch

Need a new way to watch sports? Twitch might be exactly what you‚Äôve been looking for.

It‚Äôs no secret that fans have historically consumed sports through live events and cable TV, but as media consumption has shifted, many ‚Äî especially in younger generations ‚Äî have sought out sports content on social platforms.

Twitch in particular has become a platform where sports streamers and fans have flocked. During the COVID-19 shutdowns in 2020, athletes and sports leagues around the world joined the platform to stream video games when live sports were temporarily on hiatus ‚Äî and years later, some of them are still active. WNBA player Aerial Powers regularly streams herself playing games like NBA 2K and Apex Legends, while Argentinian former soccer player Sergio Ag√ºero uses his channel to livestream Kings League and Queens League games. Organizations like the NBA, the NFL, and the UFC have their own Twitch channels where they promote and share content. For instance, the UFC runs watch-along streams hosted by former mixed martial artist, boxer, and kickboxer Jens Pulver.

Polygon is celebrating TwitchCon 2023 with a package of stories covering streaming trends and news from the show. Check it out!

In recent years, Twitch has introduced a TwitchSports channel as well as a stand-alone sports category to help users find live sporting events and sports-related content. On the stand-alone sports category page ‚Äî which, as of publication, has 2.7 million followers ‚Äî users can find creators commentating and analyzing various sports, reaction and watch-along streams, some live sports feeds, and streams of creators playing sports video games. Take a look and you‚Äôll see everything from motorsports and soccer to tennis, volleyball, and even pickleball.

EnterpriseAppsToday reported that in 2023, Twitch‚Äôs ‚ÄúSports‚Äù category registered around 8 million hours of watch time. YPulse survey research from April found that 66% of Gen Zers are tuning into platforms like Twitch to follow their favorite sports. ‚ÄúIn contrast to the more spectator-oriented sports watching of earlier generations, Gen Z has evolved the experience into an interactive digital experience through social and streaming platforms,‚Äù says Anastasia Pelot, YPulse‚Äôs content marketing manager.

While livestreams of major league games are less common to find on Twitch due to broadcast rights, some leagues ‚Äî nationally and globally ‚Äî have experimented with streaming games in recent years. The NBA signed a deal with Twitch in 2017 to stream minor league games while giving fans the chance to interact with each other. The two also teamed up in 2019 for a separate deal to exclusively stream USA Basketball games globally. When Amazon began airing Thursday Night Football games last fall, Nielsen reported a total viewership figure of 13 million for its first exclusive game, which included U.S. Prime Video subscribers who streamed on Twitch.

Twitch creator EsfandTV, who requested to go by Esfand for this story, is a streamer with 1.2 million followers who follow not only for gaming content, but for his sports streaming as well. He says that broadcast rights are one of the aspects hindering Twitch from becoming a full-blown sports streaming platform. Leagues still own the rights when it comes to where sports are aired, and Esfand says they need to adapt if they want to reach young and international sports fans.

‚ÄúThe NBA is king,‚Äù Esfand says. ‚ÄúWhen it comes to hockey, the NHL is king. But what‚Äôs happening is these different leagues, they are the boss. They‚Äôre the governing body. They have all the rights to everything and when it comes to content, they can be in control.‚Äù

Esfand says if done properly, a league can partner with a streamer that has a large audience and find a way to allow rights to reduce the barrier to entry for users. ‚ÄúYou can‚Äôt just block it out in certain markets,‚Äù Esfand says. ‚ÄúWhen I did a stream [of a football game], I think Canada couldn‚Äôt watch. Most of Europe couldn‚Äôt watch.‚Äù

Some leagues have partnered with streamers and have yielded successful results: LiveMode and FIFA partnered with Brazilian streamer Casimito to broadcast the 2022 World Cup on Twitch in Latin America, while the Men in Blazers podcast hosted its popular live watch-along shows for some World Cup matches in the U.S. Earlier this year, Casimito also struck a deal to stream the 2023 Women‚Äôs World Cup on his channel. The NBA also signed a deal in 2021 with Alexandre ‚ÄúGaules‚Äù Borba Chiqueta and Budweiser to stream games in Brazilian markets.

‚ÄúThese are the things that, if they‚Äôre done the right way, you are now attracting the younger audience who is not watching cable TV as much anymore,‚Äù Esfand says.

In place of regularly streaming games, Esfand has found other ways to engage with fans on his channel. Esfand‚Äôs Tailgate Tour, where he visits college towns and showcases college football culture ‚Äî everything from the tailgating atmosphere to the energy inside the stadium ‚Äî resonates strongly with young and global fans, especially those who might not be familiar with American college traditions.

In April, he livestreamed Esfand‚Äôs Draft Night Extravaganza on Twitch. The broadcast coincided with the first day of the NFL draft and featured a mix of Twitch creators like Will Neff and Erobb221 as well as current and former NFL players including Austin Ekeler, Micah Parsons, and Kenny Vaccaro, where they provided analysis and commentary on draft picks.

‚ÄúI have people that have been watching me for years playing World of Warcraft or doing something that isn‚Äôt football, but they‚Äôre actually huge football fans‚Äù

In some cases, fans preferred Esfand‚Äôs show to the traditional broadcast. ‚ÄúI havent watched or cared about football in like 10 years but i still watched this whole stream and loved it,‚Äù one viewer commented on YouTube, where the Twitch stream was uploaded after airing.

Another user wrote, ‚ÄúI love all things football and I pretty much had the draft on TV muted while watching your stream.‚Äù

Esfand says he feels fortunate he‚Äôs been able to stream more sports content on his channel over the last few years, to the point where people have recognized him solely for his football content. He adds that it‚Äôs been interesting seeing fans evolve from those that were fans of his gaming streams to ones who are sports fans, or discovering gaming fans who are also sports fans.

‚ÄúI have people that have been watching me for years playing World of Warcraft or doing something that isn‚Äôt football, but they‚Äôre actually huge football fans,‚Äù Esfand says. ‚ÄúA big part of Twitch is that people like watching streamers they can relate to. Because what happens is, it‚Äôs not just about the streamer; it‚Äôs also about the streamer‚Äôs chat. Now they are getting involved in the community, whether it‚Äôs just through chat itself or through Discord.‚Äù

Alex Casassovici, founder and CEO of Azarus, a company that works with online creators to enhance the streaming experience, says that livestreaming sports and sports-related content on platforms like Twitch creates a more intimate experience for streamers and fans alike.

‚ÄúI think what we‚Äôre looking at is either a very curated kind of managed channel, and more grassroots-like, creator-led experiences,‚Äù Casassovici says. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs clearly something that can be differentiated when it comes to streaming.‚Äù

Twitch seems to see value when it comes to investing in sports streamers. A few years ago, the platform launched the Sports Accelerator Program to support sports content creators wanting to get into ‚Äúsports talk,‚Äù like podcasts, talk shows, reaction streams, sidecasts, watch-alongs, and more, through live workshops and by providing opportunities to network and expand their viewership.

U.K.-based Keira Megan, who goes by keirameganxx on Twitch and was previously part of the Sports Accelerator Program, has been on the platform for about a year and a half with a focus on soccer and motorsports like Formula 1. While Formula 1 has always been primarily popular in Europe, it‚Äôs seen growth among new fans in the United States in recent years, thanks in part to docuseries like Netflix‚Äôs Drive to Survive.

While she doesn‚Äôt stream actual races or games due to broadcast rights, Megan hosts watch-along streams for fans who want to hear her commentary. Megan says that while she doesn‚Äôt have as many followers on Twitch as she does on her YouTube channel, there are elements of Twitch she prefers to YouTube, including the ability to be herself and engage with fans more closely.

‚ÄúPeople want to know what you want to say,‚Äù Megan says. ‚ÄúThey come into my Twitch channel and ask me about the race. They asked me three days later about a [soccer] match. They want to talk about it. I think Twitch is good for that. I think it‚Äôs good for one-on-one. I find that Twitch is where I‚Äôm the most engaged with my audiences, and they feel closest to me.‚Äù","Twitch is the best way to watch sports, when you can actually watch sports on Twitch",https://www.polygon.com/23923506/sports-streamers-twitch-ufc-nba-nfl-broadcast-rights-streaming,Polygon

Your time ‚Äî and money ‚Äî is precious. Polygon‚Äôs What to Buy has rounded up the best in gaming hardware, entertainment, tabletop, merch, and toys, and how to get them for the best value, so you spend less time shopping and more time enjoying.

A power bank, also commonly referred to as a portable charger, is an essential purchase for anyone who‚Äôs on the go with a phone, tablet, or a gaming handheld like a Nintendo Switch or a Steam Deck. It lets you recharge your precious gadgets one or more times via a USB connection, so you can keep talking, texting, or gaming throughout the day.

Power banks range in price depending on a few factors: how compact it is, what kind of ports it has, how much battery capacity it contains (typically measured in mAh), and how quickly it can recharge your devices.

Best portable charger for your phone and tablet

Today‚Äôs phones and tablets may differ in terms of their peak wired charging speeds, yet we‚Äôve found some battery packs that should work well no matter what device you have. It‚Äôs true that some outliers, like Samsung‚Äôs Galaxy S23 phone, can recharge at 25 W or higher depending on the model, but many other Android phones and iPhones recharge via a wired connection at under 20 W ‚Äî even less when you‚Äôre charging wirelessly.

How to pick the best power bank/portable charger for you Get one that lists the Power Delivery capability (noted as ‚ÄúPD‚Äù in the specs), and it should ideally match, or come close to, the peak charging speeds (in watts) of the devices that you intend to charge with it. The batteries we recommend for phones and tablets are also a good pick for the Nintendo Switch. However, the Steam Deck needs more juice, as do some mightier laptops that can receive power via USB-C.

In terms of tablets, picking either of the two power bank options we recommend below should be a good fit for what you may have. For reference, all iPads currently ship with 20 W power adapters, and so far, tablets from other manufacturers like Samsung and Amazon haven‚Äôt deviated far from that charging speed.

Whichever you choose, it never hurts to get some extra USB-C-to-USB-C cables. You can get this two-pack at Amazon for $15.99, so you can keep one at home and then put the other in a bag you bring around during everyday travels.

Best power bank for your Switch

The Nintendo Switch console with detachable Joy-Cons can receive a maximum of 18 W through its USB-C charging port (the Switch Lite is slightly less demanding). So, the very same compact power bank we recommend for phones and tablets can be used to charge your Switch.

Same note as before: We suggest buying more charging cables than you‚Äôll immediately need (stow one permanently in the bag you frequently use). You can get this two-pack of 100 W-ready, six-foot-long, USB-C-to-C cables at Amazon for $15.99.

Related The best Nintendo Switch accessories

Best power bank for your Steam Deck

Each Steam Deck console includes a 45 W USB-C wall adapter, so it‚Äôs a good idea to find a power bank that can meet that power level when you‚Äôre on the go. Thankfully, some options exist that can do this. One thing to note during your search is that only batteries that support the PD 3.0 spec, including the two options below, can recharge the Steam Deck at its fastest speed.

Related The best Steam Deck accessories

Best portable charger for your laptop

The number of laptops that can recharge via USB-C is growing, making it possible to use the same charger to refill your laptop as you do your phone or Nintendo Switch. For instance, Apple‚Äôs entire MacBook lineup allows it, as do several popular Windows laptops, like the Dell XPS 13, Razer‚Äôs Blade gaming laptop, and more. The thing is, different laptops have different power requirements, so one power bank may not work well across multiple laptops.

If you have a 13-inch MacBook Air or Pro, or a similarly sized Windows laptop, the chances are very good that a 65 W power bank should be fast enough to recharge your laptop as you use it (check your power supply‚Äôs wattage to be sure). Keep in mind that if you‚Äôre trying to play games, or do other resource-intensive tasks, your battery may recharge slowly, or it may continue to discharge if your power bank isn‚Äôt powerful enough.

For more powerful laptops, there are bigger, more powerful batteries to match that can supply up to 140 W of recharging power. That‚Äôs currently a top-of-the-line spec, costing significantly more than our other options, and you‚Äôll even need a compatible USB-C-to-USB-C cable to reach the 140 W top speed, as well as a laptop that supports the PD 3.1 USB-C charging spec.

One of the chargers we recommend below can match the speed delivered by Apple‚Äôs 140 W wall charger that‚Äôs included with 16-inch MacBook Pro laptops. On the Windows side of things, most laptops don‚Äôt go above 90 or 100 W at peak USB-C recharging speed, so you should be set with our picks.

It might be tough to justify spending $100 to $150 on a power bank just to charge a laptop. I get it. However, it‚Äôs easier to justify getting one if you frequently travel with multiple power-guzzling devices that you‚Äôd like to recharge simultaneously, as these are but a few available that can manage multitasking.

Nine years ago, Michelle Andrews and Zara McDonald were both 20 and working entry-level jobs in Melbourne at women‚Äôs media company Mamamia. Covering late shifts, often on weekends, they‚Äôd regularly share an Uber home. A friendship soon grew out of their shared love of pop culture. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôd be watching the same TV shows and listening to the same podcasts,‚Äù says Andrews, now 29. Their back-seat chats eventually led to an idea: Shameless ‚Äì ‚Äúa pop culture podcast for smart people who love dumb stuff‚Äù. The story of how they came to leave Mamamia ‚Äì after having their idea rejected at the final hour ‚Äì has been told many times. But these days, it‚Äôs not a moment they think of often, unless they‚Äôre asked about it in an interview. ‚ÄúIt ended up being amazing for us that they didn‚Äôt want the show,‚Äù says Andrews. Fast-forward to today, and the women are now well known as the ‚ÄúShameless girls‚Äù ‚Äì co-founders of Shameless Media, a company built out of their passion for smart conversations about pop culture. ‚ÄúWe feel so far removed from that time,‚Äù adds McDonald, 29, reflecting on their start. Since launching Shameless Media ‚Äì the home of not just Shameless but also the Everybody Has a Secret, Shameless Book Club and Love etc. podcasts ‚Äì in 2019, the company has gone from strength to strength. Today, it has 1.1 million followers across social media, plus 1 million unique listeners and 2¬Ω million podcast downloads a month.

In those early days, McDonald and Andrews were self-funded, buying their own podcasting equipment and spending just $70 to print advertising flyers. Even now, McDonald and Andrews have never taken on any outside investment. Profitable from day one, Shameless Media now has 11 staff.

On the Sunday Life photo shoot in Sydney, the two friends‚Äô support for each other is as obvious as it is genuine. Together, they discuss outfit choices and every comment from either woman about not being able to make a particular item of clothing work is enthusiastically refuted by the other. The respect they have for each other is clear, and it‚Äôs why they work so well together. Since launching Shameless, their lives have been entwined. Since meeting, they have been through break-ups, engagements and now weddings. When Andrews tied the knot with her long-term partner Mitchell Rees last December, McDonald was a bridesmaid. Now, McDonald is planning her own wedding, to partner Oliver Keogh, which will take place next year. Years ago, when discussing when, or even if, they each wanted to have kids, it was a conversation they knew they needed to have not just as friends but as business partners. ‚ÄúHow do we do this and have a family if the whole business is relying on us showing up together at the same time?‚Äù Zara McDonald ‚ÄúI hate that we had to do this, but it was like, how do we have kids?‚Äù says McDonald. ‚ÄúHow do we do this and have a family if the whole business is relying on us showing up together at the same time?‚Äù

The only way to ensure it wouldn‚Äôt be an issue was to create a contingency plan. In their case, that plan involved expanding Shameless Media by growing the team and up-skilling junior employees. While neither Andrews nor McDonald sees kids in her near future, they found it reassuring to work towards a solution. Regardless of the topic of conversation, whether it be personal or work-focused, the two try to be completely honest with each other. ‚ÄúWe realised with every honest conversation we had, our relationship was so much better ‚Äì it was far more intimate,‚Äù says McDonald. The relationship McDonald and Andrews have with Shameless listeners is also based on trust. Their podcast episodes are meticulously well-researched, book recommendations are solid and the advice given via their Ask Shameless newsletter aims to always hit the mark.

It began with a shared interest in celebrity gossip and TV shows, before moving into more personal recommendations of books and podcasts, until eventually reaching the stage where life‚Äôs most personal questions can be asked and answered. Ask Shameless, which lands in more than 64,000 subscriber inboxes each Friday, answers reader questions about work, dating, friendship and more. The best of these advice columns have been published in a new book, 4am: Answers to the conundrums that keep you up at night. Andrews and McDonald‚Äôs second book feels markedly different to their first, The Space Between. Published in 2020, it looked to explore the complications of life in one‚Äôs 20s.

‚ÄúWe wrote it when we were so young,‚Äù reflects Andrews. ‚ÄúWe truly had internalised this belief that for our words to be worthy of attention, they had to mine the deepest, darkest events that have ever happened to us.‚Äù This feeling is one Andrews has spoken about before, referring to an essay she wrote for the book which included details of her sexual assault. ‚ÄúI wish I‚Äôd just saved that for myself,‚Äù she says, adding that while she wouldn‚Äôt take back the essay, she would take back some of the details.

In it, readers trust Andrews, McDonald and other Shameless columnists with their quandaries on everything from infidelity to sibling rivalry. The book comes at a time when many young women have trust issues. TikTok is serving eating-disorder content to those already struggling, influencers and celebrities post undisclosed advertisements, and algorithms work to push everything from egg-freezing to injectables. Everywhere young women look, someone is making money off them. Zara McDonald (left) wears Venroy mini dress, $200. Michelle Andrews (right) wears Venroy shirt, $280, and pants, $280.

Only five per cent of the letters submitted to the Ask Shameless inbox are published. But after reading hundreds of requests for advice in the past three years, Andrews and McDonald are in touch with the most prevalent issues plaguing women today. One of those, says Andrews, is that ‚Äúa lot of young women do not receive the basic level of affection, attention or love from their male partners‚Äù. While there are questions the pair don‚Äôt feel qualified to answer yet ‚Äì such as when to have kids ‚Äì there‚Äôs also a kind of magic in the fact that Shameless listeners have access to McDonald and Andrews while they‚Äôre still in the thick of these struggles themselves. Loading Building a brand on trust is both a big achievement and a risk. How worried are they about getting it wrong? Turns out, not very. Andrews and McDonald know what good advice looks like, and how to give it. ‚ÄúI think the best advice is often not a statement ‚Äì it‚Äôs a question,‚Äù says Andrews. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs listening to what someone‚Äôs dilemma is, then posing a question that helps them re-frame.‚Äù As two women who are constantly being asked for advice, what are the questions they ask themselves? ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs the next thing?‚Äù says Andrews, without hesitation. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm constantly wondering, what‚Äôs the next show that isn‚Äôt out there.‚Äù
