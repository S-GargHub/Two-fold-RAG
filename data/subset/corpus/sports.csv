sports,Christy Doran,2023-10-28T21:06:03+00:00,"STADE DE FRANCE – Twenty-eight years between drinks and drama was always on the cards between these two great foes. Little did we know just how much.

But just like that famous win at Ellis Park where Nelson Mandela handed over the William Webb Ellis Cup to Francois Pienaar, it was the Springboks who once again prevailed 12-11 in an instant classic.

Unlike the blue skies that greeted Johannesburg and the Boeing 747 plane that sent shivers down the spines of everyone in attendance in 1995, rain and dampness poured down on the Stade de France.

Yet, nothing was going to dampen this evening as 80,065 fans poured in.

In a match of controversy, where cards of yellow and red were handed out quicker than a game of Uno, thundering shots both legal and illegal were put on by rugby’s two greatest sides.

Sam Cane – the All Blacks captain – was forced to watch the match from the sidelines for 53 minutes after having his yellow card for a high shot on Jesse Kriel upgraded to red. His opposite in the number seven jersey, Siya Kolisi, was later shown a yellow card for a high shot on Ardie Savea, but returned.

Cheslin Kolbe – the magnificent winger who sealed their World Cup triumph four years earlier against England – meanwhile couldn’t bare to watch from the sidelines after being shown a yellow card for a deliberate knockdown in the 73rd minute.

It was that kind of evening, where the margins were tiny and the outcomes almighty.

“There are no ways I can explain it,” Kolisi said.

“I want to give credit to the All Blacks. They took us to the end, they took us to a dark place. It shows what kind of team they are, to fight with a man down from early in the game. They put us under so much pressure.

“Credit to my boys too for the fight. I am just grateful we could pull it off.”

Speaking of mighty, Pieter-Steph du Toit – the 2019 World Rugby player of the year – played his best match in four years as he spearheaded the Springboks’ physical onslaught. The back-rower made 28 tackles, each as bone-crunching as the next.

By claiming their third one-point knockout victory in a row, the Springboks moved into uncharted territory by leapfrogging the All Blacks by sealing their fourth World Cup. It was the second straight tournament the Springboks won in France, having beaten England at the same venue in 2007.

A missed Richie Mo’unga conversion following Beauden Barrett’s 58th minute try – the only five-pointer of the match – ultimately proved the difference, as Handre Pollard’s four three-pointers led the Springboks to World Cup glory.

The All Blacks had their chances, but their usual safe handling, a feature throughout the World Cup after their first-up loss to France, evaded them against the Springboks’ blitz defence in the wet conditions.

All night the All Blacks’ timing was off and the forced ball from Savea out wide just as the men in black saw space and looked to open up the Springboks in the 80th minute proved to be killer blow.

Wayne Barnes, who was booed relentlessly, called a scrum reset as the seconds ticked by.

Moments later, their hearts sunk as the Springboks managed to win the scrum and then hang onto the ball.

The victory was the perfect sign-off for the Springboks’ management, with director of rugby Rassie Erasmus set to follow head coach Jacques Nienaber out.

The duo will go down as the greatest coaching duo in rugby history, having led the Springboks to back-to-back World Cup triumphs.

“We came a long way with the players. We always planned for this World Cup, since 2018,” Nienaber said.

“Massive credit to our fans. They were special from South Africa, 62 million people, the videos we had to play from them. It was unbelievable.”

Veteran back-rower Duane Vermeulen will also call time on his illustrious career.

All Blacks coach Ian Foster’s tenure in charge has also come to an end, with Scott Robertson to take over following a bumpy four years in charge.

Robertson will have an almighty task on his hand, with multiple generational players including Dane Coles, Sam Whitelock, Brodie Retallick and Aaron Smith to call time on their international careers. Others like Ardie Savea, Mo’unga, Beauden Barrett and Shannon Frizell will also head to Japan.

While Foster didn’t want to take anything away from the Springboks’ win, he said the game had some issues to sort out regarding the officiating.

“I’m proud of our guys, to go down to that red card so early and fight our way back and give ourselves a chance is pretty special,” the departing All Blacks coach said.

“I don’t think it went wrong in any clear [place on the pitch], it was a real arm wrestle, both teams have their moment, incredibly proud of the way we fought and to get within a whisker of pulling it off is heart-breaking.

“This group is very proud to be All Blacks, very proud to play for their country and have worked incredibly hard to get here.

“While I am so proud of what we did and how we worked we have to give it to South Africa, they are a quality team. They have had a few close victories in this tournament and are a different class. It’s special for them but it equally hurts for us. I can’t ask for much more than we did, we couldn’t put more out on the park.”

Controversy was on display from the outset, as Frizell was shown a yellow card for an illegal cleanout on Springboks hooker Bongi Mbonambi. The incident saw the hooker, who was cleared earlier in the week by World Rugby following an alleged racial slur on England back-rower Tom Curry, replaced by Deon Fourie in the third minute.

The penalty allowed Pollard to step up and bang over three points.

The All Blacks were on the backfoot much of the opening quarter and, after Ethan de Groot was pinged for not rolling away, the Springboks moved further ahead after 12 minutes.

A wicked bounce following a lovely Jordie Barrett chip kick denied Savea a try soon after. But the All Blacks were on the scoreboard via Mo’unga moments later as Barnes was playing advantage.

But the Springboks restored their six-point lead soon after as Savea was pinged for not releasing. Barnes later apologised, with the No.8 having a split-second separation.

The Springboks’ rush defence caused the All Blacks problems all evening, as Damian de Allende and Kriel forced their opponents into errors. Will Jordan, the impressive young outside back who scored eight tries, had a difficult night and was replaced midway through the second half.

The biggest error was around the corner, as Kriel stepped back into the defence and Cane failed to drop his body height and clocked the centre in the jaw. He didn’t return.

The Springboks took a 12-3 lead after 34 minutes when the All Blacks once again failed to release on their goal line. Pollard licked his lips and said ‘thanks’.

The All Blacks managed to cut the deficit to 12-6 after 37 minutes when Eben Etzebeth was caught offside and denied his opponents some quick ball.

Foster’s men breathed a sigh of relief when Kolisi blew a chance out wide when he tucked the ball under his arms and went himself after Beauden Barrett failed to collect a high ball in the 42nd minute.

Minutes later and Kolisi was off, as he cannoned into Savea. He would later return, much to the anger of the New Zealanders in the crowd who were calling for justice.

Sensing an opportunity to strike against 14 men, the All Blacks kicked for the corner on a couple occasions out wide. It came back to haunt them, as their usually silky and composed skill sets failed them.

That much was true when the TMO intervened after Smith thought he had a try in his final Test, but an error at the lineout cancelled out the five-pointer.

Eventually the All Blacks did have a try, as Mark Telea, the All Blacks’ best and biggest attacking threat all night, managed to get on the outside and draw in two defenders before offloading to Beauden Barrett. But Mo’unga missed the conversion to leave them trailing by a point.

That lone point would prove the difference, as the Springboks celebrated a remarkable victory by a remarkable side.","THE GREATEST!

sports,Christy Doran,2023-10-18T20:55:55+00:00,"PARIS – The All Blacks have downplayed Rieko Ioane’s gestures towards Ireland fans and retiring great Johnny Sexton, as the three-time world champions said they have learned to “respect Argentina” ahead of their semi-final on Saturday (6am AEDT).

It comes as Michael Cheika embraced the underdog status and said he was hoping Los Pumas “inspired” Argentina “not by our results but by our ambition”, as the former Wallabies coach readies for another clash against the All Blacks and a second semi-final.

Facebook Twitter Whatsapp Reddit Email Share

Ioane copped a spray from Sexton following their 28-24 nail-biting win over Ireland.

It came after the lethal back cupped his ear at Irish supporters at the Stade de France after the final whistle, as well as putting his finger to his lips in a ‘shush gesture’.

Ian Foster, who made two changes to his starting side and three in total, was forced to defend his centre’s actions while twisting the knife into Sexton’s finish.

“It happens on most sporting parks when tensions are high and a lot at stake,” Foster said.

“Unfortunately recently it’s also included players saying a few things to referees. Is it right for the game? I don’t know. You don’t hear a lot of players complaining about it.”

Captain Sam Cane added: “It’s players’ different personalities and emotions running high in those moments. There’s always people who have different tactics but it’s always just left out there.”

Foster recalled Sam Whitelock to the starting side in the only change to the pack.

Whitelock, whose breakdown penalty win after 37 phases denied Ireland a match-winning penalty, has been recalled and will partner Scott Barrett in the second-row. Brodie Retallick will come off the bench.

Elsewhere, Mark Telea has been recalled ahead of Leicester Fainga’anuku. The tryscoring machine was axed for the quarter-final after missing a team curfew.

“That’s the team we think best for this week,” Foster said.

“Mark has done his time. He made a mistake and accepted what was happening but you don’t linger in that space. He’s been our form winger. We have got a faith in him and think he is in good place to play this game.

“We really enjoyed Leicester Fainga’anuku]’s game last week and he should be proud of that and its’s a tough selection. It’s a chance for us to get Mark on the park.”

The All Blacks are 18-point favourites for the opening semi-final.

It comes despite Argentina knocking over the All Blacks last year in Christchurch, as well as a maiden defeat in 2020 in Sydney.

“The past sets us up beautifully for both teams,” Foster said.

“We do know each other but we don’t know each other terms of a Rugby World Cup, so at this stage in the tournament it’s new territory for us and as we’ve seen World Cups are very different.”

“We have learnt to greatly respect Argentina. They have a rich history of overachieving at the World Cup and have done a fantastic job to get here at the same level we are, so it is going to be a heck of a game.”

Foster said the All Blacks, who suffered a shock semi-final loss to Eddie Jones’ England in 2019, never consider themselves favourites.

“Firstly, you’ve never heard us say we’re favourites,” he said.

‘We know these games are do or die. We’re going to have to improve our performance. The stage gets bigger at this time in the tournament and you’ve got to grow your game. That’s our strong focus. The best team on the night wins – Argentina has done that to us.”

Cheika however was happy to remind the All Blacks who were favourites.

“”New Zealand has always been an example in rugby, a benchmark. They make you think of high-level skills in a really open game but there are always threats in the lineout, mauls and rucks,” said Cheika, whose Wallabies lost in the 2015 final.

“You have to take the moments you are in the game and see them coming at you at different times.

Advertisement

“In the game in 2020 there were things you could pinpoint. You can’t say that one game means we can do it as there are a lot of games where we haven’t.

“That moment has to be just a part of it. What we have done since then, all the success and failures [matters in our preparation]. The other team are heavy favourites, everyone is expecting a New Zealand and South Africa final. We just have to focus on what is required.”

Cheika has maintained that his Los Pumas side was too tight earlier in the tournament but has begun to free themselves up since qualifying for the knockout stages – and rewarding their fans by doing so.

On inspiring the country?

“It’s not easy,” he said.

“We want to inspire not just by our results but by our ambition, by our ability to get back up and overcome obstacles.

“To inspire is not about results, it’s not just one player who played well; no, it’s about our behaviour in general, our ability to be ready to come back from difficult times and seizing our opportunities.

“There are not a lot of opportunities in life – us playing in a semi-final is even rarer and we want to have no regrets.”",‘It happens’: All Blacks defend star centre after spray as Cheika heaps pressure on ‘favourites’ New Zealand,https://www.theroar.com.au/2023/10/19/it-happens-all-blacks-defend-star-centre-after-spray-as-cheika-heaps-pressure-on-favourites-new-zealand/,The Roar | Sports Writers Blog
sports,Martin Derbyshire,2023-11-06T22:21:05+00:00,"Line shopping is the key that unlocks the best odds and lines at top sports betting sites.

The process is as simple as checking the lines and odds for your prospective bet at multiple online sports betting sites. The result is quite often better odds and improved lines.

What is line shopping, and why is it worth your time? Find the answers below in our complete guide to line shopping.

How do sportsbooks set odds and lines?

The best sportsbooks employ oddsmakers and oddsmaking services to set their lines and odds.

Other sports betting apps simply copy those lines. The oddsmakers and oddsmaking services use computer models and algorithms that consider analytics, statistics, injury and roster news, performance, matchup data, and more to develop the lines and odds.

Betting lines and odds are then subject to change based on the betting public’s reaction and any additional information that comes to light ahead of the game. Sportsbooks will move the line or change the odds if the public bets heavily on one side.

Every sportsbook’s goal is to even out the betting on both sides of every bet. That allows sportsbooks to earn the profit built into the odds and lines without worrying about which side wins.

The betting is rarely the same at every sportsbook. While one sportsbook may be forced to move a line or change the odds because of betting, another won’t. That’s when you’ll spot a difference between sportsbooks. This difference may allow you to book a bet at improved odds or a more favorable line.

The lines and odds may even be different right from the jump. Either way, the differences are why line shopping always makes sense. Shop around, and you can find opportunities to lay less, win more, and improve your chances.

Shop for the best lines at online sportsbooks

Below is a live odds feed that shows you the differences between lines and odds for the same bets at many of the top sportsbooks in the country. Look here for current opportunities.

What’s the best way to shop lines?

The easiest way to line-shop is to find something like the live odds feed above. It’s a one-stop shop. Shopping lines here will take just seconds.

Performing the task manually may take longer, but you can check with more sportsbooks or the chosen few you feel consistently offer the best lines and odds. The best way to do this is to download and install more than one of the best sports betting apps on your phone.

Then, tap around among the sportsbooks to compare lines and odds for the bets you plan.

Best sportsbooks for line shopping

The biggest brands in sports betting offer competitive lines in dozens of states. Shop around at the following top online sportsbooks to find the best prices on your bets.

Caesars Sportsbook

Caesars' odds and lines are consistently among the best in the country, making it a must-see when shopping lines. The point spreads here can be a half-point to two points better than the competition’s, and the moneyline odds may be more favorable.

BetMGM Sportsbook

The lines and odds at BetMGM are consistently competitive. Plus, sports betting promos and odds boosts abound, so you'll find a better price on many bets here.

DraftKings Sportsbook

DraftKings has more open betting markets than most online sportsbooks, and the lines and odds are always competitive.

FanDuel Sportsbook

FanDuel is committed to posting competitive odds and runs so many generous promos and odds boosts that it is always worth a look.

How to find the best lines and odds for any bet

Shopping around lets you find the best lines and odds for any bet. That means checking the posted lines and odds for the same bets at different sportsbooks.

You can do this for moneylines, point spreads, totals bets, prop bets, and more. Finding the best line or better odds on any bet is like finding money.

You can shop around using multiple sportsbook apps on your phone or live odds feeds like the one above. Pick a side, then use the drop-down menus and tabs to find the odds and lines for that bet.

Finally, bet when you see an opportunity at better odds or an improved line compared to the competition.

Line shopping for futures

People tend to bet futures at their favorite online sportsbook. However, shopping for better odds on any future bet is worth your time. Most game lines are similar at different sportsbooks, but the odds in futures markets can vary significantly.

Sportsbooks sometimes have higher liabilities for specific teams and offer better odds on others to lay that off. Timing is everything.

Get it right, and you can easily take advantage of changes in different futures markets due to liability. However, the only way to find these opportunities is shopping lines.

Can I get a better line or odds after I’ve already bet?

When you bet, you lock in the odds or line as currently posted. If they change, for better or worse, you’re stuck with the odds from when you wagered.

That’s precisely why you should go line shopping before you bet. Of course, if significant changes occur, you can take more action at the improved odds or more favorable line.

Is line shopping worth my time?

Because it can provide you the opportunity to lay less, win more, and improve your chances, line shopping is certainly worth your time. Plus, it doesn’t have to take up all that much of it.

Use the live odds feed above to do a basic survey. You’ll find it takes just seconds to compare lines and odds. Plus, download and install multiple licensed online sportsbook apps on your phone, and you can do a more thorough shop in just a few minutes.

Getting more points or laying fewer on a typical NFL point spread or NBA point spread might lead to winning a bet you’d otherwise lose. Plus, if you find better odds on any bet, you can potentially drop fewer dollars when you lose and earn more when you win.

Shopping lines will help you consistently find the best prices on your bets. It won't help you pick more winners, but it will improve your chances and lead to bigger wins and more affordable losses. That’s undoubtedly worth your time.

For example, you might like the Kansas City Chiefs to beat the Cincinnati Bengals in a mid-season NFL game. Say you look around and see that three of four licensed online sportsbooks in your state have the Chiefs as -3 favorites, but the fourth has them at just -2.5.

Let’s say the Chiefs win by exactly three, a distinct possibility since a single field goal decides most NFL games. Bets at the first three sportsbooks would push. However, you’d have a winner at the fourth. If you didn’t shop around, you’d never have found that half-point victory and be stuck with a push instead of a profit.

What is the Vegas line?

Las Vegas sportsbooks set the standard for lines and odds across the country. If a sportsbook is copying a line, it’s usually copying the Vegas line. Most online betting sites don’t stray too far from the Vegas line, using it as a foundation for setting all lines in every major sport.

If those lines do shift, it’s usually because of increased betting on one side of a bet. Shop lines locally, and you can take advantage when sportsbooks stray from the Vegas line.

Why do the lines move?

It’s worth reiterating that sportsbooks want an equal amount of money bet on each side of every bet. When that happens, they earn the small profit built into the odds without concern about who wins or loses.

Sportsbooks want even betting so much that they’ll move a line or change the odds to draw more bets to the other side to get it that way.

That’s when you’ll see a difference between the lines and odds. Every sportsbook jumps on board when a line moves or odds change for a legitimate reason, like an injury or roster move. It’ll be difficult for you to find value in that case.

But when a line moves or odds change because of betting patterns, only the sportsbook that saw the betting makes the change. That’s your opportunity right there.

Line shopping is a tool to help you spot changes due to betting patterns. Then, you can simply take advantage of movement in a line or changes in the odds.

Choose a side, shop around at online sportsbooks, compare the lines and odds, and then pounce when you find one that has something different and more favorable to your viewpoint.

sports,Sam Eggleston,2023-11-01T21:25:48+00:00,"The primary draw of the moneyline bet lies in its simplicity. Even those just dipping their toes into the world of sports betting for the first time can quickly get a handle on the basics of the moneyline.

On this page we'll unpack the ins and outs of moneyline betting in more detail.

What is a moneyline bet?

So, what's the essence of a moneyline bet? In this type of bet, the sole focus is identifying the winner.

The victory margin and the total points scored have no bearing. It doesn't matter if your chosen team clinches a win with a score of 2-1 or a blowout of 50-0; the payout remains unchanged.

In this way, the moneyline distills sports to their essence: cheering for a victor.

Every moneyline bet has a favorite and an underdog as determined by the sportsbook. In the context of moneyline betting, ""favorites"" and ""underdogs"" refer to the perceived stronger and weaker participants, respectively.

Favorites:

The favorite is the participant (be it a team or an individual) who is expected to win the event or matchup.

In moneyline odds, especially in American odds format, the favorite is usually represented with a minus (-) sign. For instance, if Team A is a favorite and is listed at -150, a bettor would need to wager $150 to win $100.

Underdogs:

The underdog is the participant deemed less likely to win compared to the opponent.

Underdogs in moneyline odds, particularly in the American odds format, are usually represented with a plus (+) sign. If Team B is an underdog and has odds of +130, a bettor would win $130 for every $100 they bet, should Team B win.

Moneyline odds formats

You'll typically encounter three types of odds when researching and handicapping across various platforms—decimal, fractional, and American.

Most listings on the best online sports betting sites predominantly use American Odds.

American Odds

You'll usually see these displayed as either a negative (-) or positive (+) number, symbolizing different implications in the betting world.

The negative numbers might seem a bit perplexing at first. They point to the team, player, or option considered the favorite to win.

This number can also represent wagers that are less than even money. Essentially, the negative figure tells you how much you need to bet to earn a profit of $100. We'll clarify with an example shortly.

Conversely, positive odds signal the underdog in the betting scenario or bets that offer more than even money. This figure shows how much profit you'll make on a $100 wager.

To illustrate with a moneyline bet: Imagine on a top NFL betting site the New England Patriots are listed as -110 favorites, while the New York Jets stand at +250.

You decide to back the favorite and bet $110 on the Pats. The Pats win, and you end up with $210.

That sum comprises your initial $110 bet and the $100 profit you've earned.

Fractional Odds

While you might occasionally encounter these odds, especially in contexts like horse racing, they're quite straightforward once you get the hang of them, even if they initially seem like a math problem.

These odds typically look like two numbers separated by a slash (/) or a dash (-), resembling a fraction. For instance, you might see 5/1 or 5-1.

Here's a simple way to interpret fractions: the first number (akin to the numerator in math) represents potential profit, while the second (akin to the denominator) indicates the amount you need to stake.

In other words, the denominator tells you how much you need to bet to earn a profit equivalent to the numerator.

For example, with 2/1 odds, you'd earn $2 for every $1 you wager. Conversely, with 4/9 odds, a bet of $9 would yield a $4 profit.

To further illustrate, if you placed a bet of $9 at 4/9 odds and won, you'd receive $13 in total: your initial $9 stake plus the $4 profit.

Decimal Odds

Decimals are to betting what the metric system is to measurements: straightforward and user-friendly. They present fewer intricacies compared to their American and fractional counterparts.

However, just as the metric system is not universally embraced in the US, decimal odds can also be overlooked there.

Fortunately, working with decimal odds is simple. To determine a bet's payout, you multiply the decimal odds by the amount you're betting.

For instance, if the odds on an NHL betting site have the Edmonton Oilers at 2.53 to beat the Detroit Red Wings, a $10 bet would yield a $25.30 return. This includes your initial $10 wager, along with a profit of $15.30.

It's essential to note that this calculation gives you the total payout, not just your earnings. If you're keen on tracking your profits from betting, remember to subtract your original stake from the payout to get an accurate figure.

Why do moneyline odds change?

Lines at the best sports betting apps change quickly due to two primary reasons:

Public betting

New information

Before setting odds for an event, oddsmakers gather extensive data. Once they finalize the odds, they release them to the public.

As a bettor, you can bet immediately or wait for potential shifts in the odds, although predicting these shifts is challenging.

For instance, when examining odds for the next Super Bowl champion released shortly after the previous Super Bowl, these odds are based mostly on the recently concluded season.

As the new season approaches and teams make changes, odds adjust based on perceived championship chances. As games progress, lines continue to evolve based on team performances.

Public betting can also sway lines. If too many wagers favor one outcome, sportsbooks adjust the odds to balance the bets. This ensures an even distribution of bets and reduces the sportsbook's financial risk.

Moneyline betting outcomes

When you’re placing a moneyline wager, several outcomes are possible. The most straightforward outcome is a win or a loss, determined by whether the team or individual you bet on is victorious or defeated.

There's also the possibility of a draw, which occurs if the event ends in a tie.

Moneyline win

Winning a moneyline bet is very straightforward. All you need to do is pick the team or individual who is going to win an event and choose correctly.

If you bet on a boxing match between Boxer A and Boxer B, and you've bet on Boxer B to win and he does, then your bet would be successful and you'd get paid based on the odds at the time you placed your wager.

Moneyline loss

When placing a moneyline wager, a loss simply means that the team or individual you bet on did not win the event or matchup.

For example, let's say on an NBA betting site you bet on a basketball game between Team A and Team B. You believe Team A will win, so you place a $100 moneyline wager on them. If Team B wins, your bet on Team A would be a loss.

Draw

In some sports, notably soccer, games can end in a draw, and bettors have the option to wager on this outcome. When placing a moneyline wager in such situations, you'll typically see three sets of odds: one for each team to win and one for the game to end in a draw.

For instance, consider a soccer match between Team A and Team B. The moneyline odds might look something like this:

Team A: +150

+150 Draw: +220

+220 Team B: +180

If you believe the game will end in a tie, you could place a $100 wager on the ""Draw"" option. If the match indeed concludes with a tied score, you would win based on the +220 odds. This means you'd receive $220 in profit on top of your $100 stake, totaling $320. However, if either Team A or Team B wins, you'd lose your $100 wager.

The Heat are the underdogs. If you place a $100 bet on the Heat and they win, your profit would be $130.

Moneyline odds in baseball

MLB moneyline odds for a game between the New York Yankees and the Boston Red Sox might look like this:

New York Yankees: -120

-120 Boston Red Sox: +100

The Yankees are slight favorites. If you bet $120 on the Yankees and they win, you'd earn a profit of $100. The Red Sox have even odds, shown by the +100. This means if you bet $100 on the Red Sox and they win, you'd also earn a profit of $100.

Moneyline odds in hockey

NHL moneyline odds for a game between the Toronto Maple Leafs and the Chicago Blackhawks might be displayed as:

Toronto Maple Leafs: -140

Tennis odds for a match between Serena Williams and Maria Sharapova might be displayed as:

Serena Williams: -150

-150 Maria Sharapova: +130

In this hypothetical matchup, Serena is the favorite to win. If you bet $150 on Williams and she wins, you would earn a profit of $100. Sharapova is the underdog. If you place a $100 wager on Sharapova and she manages to win, you'll receive a profit of $130.

Moneyline odds in golf

Let's consider some PGA tour odds at one of the best golf betting sites where you're betting on an individual golfer to win. The moneyline odds might be presented as:

Tiger Woods: +500

+500 Rory McIlroy: +600

In this hypothetical tournament scenario, neither golfer is a strong favorite, but the odds indicate their perceived chances to win. If you decide to bet $100 on Tiger Woods and he wins the tournament, you'd earn a profit of $500.

On the other hand, if you place a $100 wager on Rory McIlroy and he clinches the tournament victory, you'd secure a profit of $600.

It's important to note that in PGA and other golf tournaments, there are usually many players, so the odds can be much higher than in head-to-head sports matchups, given the broader field of competition.

Moneyline Betting FAQ

How do moneyline bets work?

Moneylines hinge on the outright winner of a game or event. They are presented with either a positive (+) or negative (-) sign:

A positive moneyline (+) indicates the underdog and represents the amount of profit on a $100 bet.

A negative moneyline (-) indicates the favorite and shows how much you need to bet to earn a $100 profit.

What happens if there’s a tie in a moneyline bet?

If there's a tie in a moneyline bet, it is typically referred to as a ""push."" When a push occurs, bettors are refunded their original wager. No money is won or lost. However, sports that typically have the possibility of a tie (like soccer) often provide bettors with the option to bet on a draw.

If the game ends in a draw and you haven't bet on that option, you would lose your bet. It's essential to understand the specific rules of the sportsbook and the sport you're betting on to know how ties are handled.

Does overtime count in my moneyline bet?

Yes, in most sports and with most sportsbooks (including new betting sites), overtime (or any extra time or tiebreakers) does count in a moneyline bet.

That said, always check the specific rules of the sportsbook you're using to ensure you understand their policies.

Why do moneyline odds change?

Moneyline odds change for several reasons.

Public Betting Patterns: If a significant amount of money is being placed on one team or participant, sportsbooks might adjust the odds to balance their liability. By making the odds less favorable for a heavily-bet team and more favorable for the less-bet team, they can encourage more even betting.

Who are the NBA RoY odds favorites?

Victor Wembanyama: Coach Gregg Popovich's Spurs have a gem in Victor Wembanyama, a generational talent and a strong Rookie of the Year contender. Even with a young roster and potential load management, Wembanyama's undeniable impact is evident.

His elite defense, highlighted by his 7-foot-4 height and 8-foot wingspan, allows him to dominate where others can't. Offensively, his agility and skill set are unparalleled for his size. If he refines his shooting and continues to adapt to the Spurs' style, as seen in his impressive NBA preseason performance, he'll be a force to reckon with.

Scoot Henderson: The Portland Trail Blazers have restructured, placing Henderson as Damian Lillard's successor. Supported by talents such as Anfernee Simons and Jerami Grant, much of the Blazers' fortunes hinge on Henderson.

After a stellar season with the G League Ignite, expectations for his rookie year are soaring. Known for his strength and agility, and with a promising defense, Henderson is set to become a fan favorite.

Chet Holmgren: The Oklahoma City Thunder anticipate a strong season, largely due to Holmgren. Boasting a 7-foot frame and notable skills, Holmgren stands out as a Rookie of the Year contender, underpinned by impressive stats and team impact.

His wingspan and defensive prowess will challenge opponents. Offensively, he capitalizes on mismatches and has diverse scoring abilities, from the paint to the 3-point line. His underrated passing syncs well with OKC's pace and style.

When is the best time for NBA ROTY odds?

The earlier you bet on NBA ROTY, the better the odds. But you’ll be doing so without much information that could be key in making an educated decision.

Conversely, if you wait for the data you need for an informed bet, the odds will tighten up, and you will see less of a return on your wager.

When the lines are first released for NBA ROTY honors, the season hasn’t even started yet, so there are no statistics, trends, or player news. The pre-season odds are so favorable because even the oddsmakers don’t have the data to craft more specific lines.

Once the season has started and you get to see how the various rookies are performing, you can gather the relevant data. But sportsbooks are also gathering this information, and they begin to tighten the NBA Rookie of the Year lines in response.

So, while you can better guess which player will hoist the Wilt Chamberlain Trophy, the odds will be tighter, and your potential return on your wager will be reduced.

Pros and cons of betting early on the NBA Rookie of the Year:

Pros:

You have an opportunity to find better value.

The betting odds are fresh and haven't been adjusted.

Cons:

There is a much higher risk as a player's performance, health, and team dynamic can change throughout the season.

You’ll find limited information to make an informed bet.

Pros and cons of waiting to bet on the NBA Rookie of the Year:

Pros:

There is a lot more information available to make an informed bet.

You don’t risk betting on a player not remotely in contention.

Cons:

There is a reduced opportunity to find value.

The odds may not be as favorable.

Keep in mind that it’s always important to take into consideration your risk tolerance while you weigh the potential rewards. No matter when you decide to make your wager, always gather as much information as possible before risking your hard-earned money.

sports,James Wallace,2023-12-12T21:49:56+00:00,"13 Dec 2023 02.36 GMT James Wallace That’s it from me this evening/morning. Time to haul myself out of the OBO armchair and skulk off for some kip. That was an intriguing game and sets up this T20I series nicely. A real statement has been laid down by Rovman Powell and his men, West Indies were up against it early doors with England crunching their way to 112-2 off the first ten overs but Jos Buttler’s side only managed to make 59 runs off the next ten, losing eight wickets along the way. A total of 171 was thirty or more shy of where England would have liked to have ended up and so it proved as West Indies peeled up their sleeves and showed how muscular their own batting card is – the home side cleared the ropes fourteen times compared to England’s six. Andre Russell and Rovman Powell found the stands with ease at the business end of the match to get West Indies over the line with eleven balls remaining. We’ll be back to cover the second match in Grenada on Thursday, do join us for that. Until then, thank you and goodnight.

Updated at 02.36 GMT

13 Dec 2023 02.28 GMT Andre Russell is Player of the Match: In his first T20I in over two years he took 3-29 and smashed 29* off just 14 deliveries with the game in the balance. He seems very pleased to be back in maroon. Life is so funny. Since when I got selected for the West Indies two weeks ago I’ve been dreaming of being man of the match.”



13 Dec 2023 02.09 GMT West Indies win by 4 wickets! Andre Russell smashes the winning runs off Sam Curran! A length ball is spanked over point for a one bounce four to give the home side the win, they go 1-0 up in the series.

Updated at 02.29 GMT

13 Dec 2023 02.07 GMT 18th over: West Indies 168-6 (Powell 31, Russell 25) Adil Rashid is recalled for his final over, can he turn the game back to England? Nope. ANDRE RUSSELL SMASHES THE RASHID GOOGLY CLEAN OUT OF THE GROUND! Huge SIX! The big man even allows himself a coy smile. He enjoyed that one. A dot the next ball is followed by a powerful drive all along the baize for four! Eleven in total off the over and West Indies now just need four runs.



13 Dec 2023 02.01 GMT 17th over: West Indies 157-6 (Powell 31, Russell 14) Tymal Mills is entrusted. Singles off the first two balls. Powell swipes a full ball into the deep to collect a couple. SIX! Mills goes short and Powell gets a mighty top edge for a maximum! Fortune favours the brave, the Windies skipper gave that everything and it could have gone anywhere. Mills sends one down the leg side – wide ball. Pressure on the bowler here… Shot! Short and wide from Mills and sent to the fence with Swiss clock timing by Powell. Sixteen off the over, looking terminal for Buttler and co. 15 needed from 18 balls.



13 Dec 2023 01.55 GMT 16th over: West Indies 141-6 (Powell 26, Russell 4) Livingstone continues. Four singles off the first four balls keeps the pressure on the West Indies. HOLD THAT THOUGHT. Rovman Powell crunches consecutive sixes down the ground with a shrug and swagger to make it sixteen off the over. The scales tip once more, England need to do away with one or both of Powell and Russell – there’s no way they don’t win this for West Indies if they are there at the end. 31 needed from 24 balls.



13 Dec 2023 01.51 GMT 15th over: West Indies 125-6 (Powell 12, Russell 2) Andre Russell the man to face the hattrick ball… Boo! A decent ball on the stumps is patted back by the big man. Drama in Barbados, Russell works for a couple. Ahmed takes his cap with a broad smile on his face – he hasn’t had it all his own way but finishes with 3-39 from his set of four. Advantage England? 47 needed from 30 balls.

Updated at 01.54 GMT

13 Dec 2023 01.47 GMT WICKET! Shepherd c Curran b Rehan Ahmed 0 (West Indies 123-6) Rehan Ahmed on a hattrick! Buttler brings Curran into slip and Shepherd pokes a leggie to him off his very first ball. Great stuff from Rehan who has turned the game England’s way in the space of a minute.



13 Dec 2023 01.45 GMT WICKET! Shai Hope c Brook b Rehan Ahmed 36 (West Indies 123-5) Ahmed is bunted for SIX by Shai Hope but strikes with the next ball as Hope holes out!



13 Dec 2023 01.44 GMT 14th over: West Indies 112-4 (Hope 27, Powell 10) Liam Livingstone instead of Rashid and he does well to keep it to singles, England trying to take this as deep as possible and hope West Indies fluff their lines at the death. West Indies need 55 from 36 balls.



13 Dec 2023 01.41 GMT 13th over: West Indies 112-4 (Hope 27, Powell 10) Rehan has two balls left to complete his over. The first ball is flayed for four by Powell behind point! Valuable runs for West Indies. Rehan’s final ball is a dot, defended by Powell into the off side. West Indies need 60 from 42 balls.

Updated at 01.42 GMT

13 Dec 2023 01.30 GMT Simon Burnton is our man in Barbados and he sends good news! “It’s a 9.35pm restart. We haven’t lost any overs.” We should be underway in about eight minutes. I believe that 10.10pm local time is the cut off for the match – that’ll be 2.10am here in London town. Excuse me whilst I head to the kitchen to microdose some Kenco.



13 Dec 2023 01.14 GMT Promising news – the rain seems to be tailing off and a rope is being dragged around the outfield to take off any excess water. I’ll bring news as soon as it wafts over from Barbados to my sofa.



13 Dec 2023 01.00 GMT Rain stops play (West Indies 108-4 and require 64 runs off 44 balls) What’s all this then? Out of nowhere the heavens crack like an inky brûlée and rain starts to pour. The players scurry off as the covers are hauled on. Crucially – West Indies are six runs ahead of the Duckworth Lewis Stern rate. IF the rain doesn’t abate – and it looks heavy at the moment – then the home side will take the spoils. 12.4 overs: West Indies 108-4 (Hope 27, Powell 6)

Updated at 01.09 GMT

13 Dec 2023 00.58 GMT 12th over: West Indies 102-4 (Hope 26, Hetmyer 1) Just a single and the wicket off the over, Shai Hope can’t break the legspin shackles. Windies skipper Rovman Powell is the new man and Buttler cranks the pressure by inserting a slip.

Updated at 01.04 GMT

13 Dec 2023 00.52 GMT WICKET! Hetmyer c Duckett b Rashid 1 (West Indies 101-4) Adil Rashid takes his 100th T20I wicket! A crucial one in the context of the game too – the dangerous Hetmyer is sent on his way for just a single as England look to ramp up the pressure heading into the nub end of this match. Hetmyer danced out of his crease and got a good piece of the length ball but it flew flat and hard to Duckett on the midwicket sponge. And he does it on his 100th T20I appearance! 💯#BBCCricket #WIvENG pic.twitter.com/LYhUBtNnUj — Test Match Special (@bbctms) December 13, 2023

Updated at 01.02 GMT

13 Dec 2023 00.49 GMT WICKET! Pooran c & b Rehan Ahmed 13 (West Indies 100-3) Rehan back into the attack after his first over was minced for n n n n nineteen. Got him! Pooran flicks back a full ball and Rehan takes a nifty catch tumbling away to his left. Shimron Hetymer is the new batter and he tucks a single into the leg side to open his account. The wicket has given Ahmed a confidence boost and he gets out of the over with three dots. 11th over: West Indies 101-3 (Hope 25, Hetmyer 1)



13 Dec 2023 00.43 GMT 10th over: West Indies 99-2 (Hope 25, Pooran 13) Rashid is given another after his excellent first over. The googly is spotted by Pooran and driven down the ground handsomely for SIX! A glide behind point bring a single, Hope returns the favour with a flick into the leg side. A short ball is panned into the deep by Pooran for a couple to end the over. Bon Jovi O’clock – West Indies need 73 from 60. Time for a quick slurp for the players and a knuckle stretch for me. Is there anybody alive out there?!



13 Dec 2023 00.37 GMT 9th over: West Indies 87-2 (Hope 23, Pooran 3) Will the wickets slow the Windies as they did England? Rehan is replaced by Tymal Mills who starts with another wide. Rusty stuff so far from the southpaw seamer. That’s better – a series of slower balls and back of the hand trickery restricts Pooran and Hope before the final ball is top edged over Buttler’s head for a one bounce four. West Indies need 85 from 66 balls.



13 Dec 2023 00.32 GMT WICKET! Kyle Mayers c Brook b Rashid 35 (West Indies 79-3) The sorcerer follows his apprentice and bags a wicket first ball! That’s Rashid’s 99th T20I wicket – in truth it was a bit of a drag down but from the front of the hand so it skidded onto Mayers who didn’t time it and was caught by Brook in the deep. England needed that BIG TIME. A masterclass from Rashid in the rest of the over, Nicholas Pooran is the new man and his clip for one is the only run from the over. 8th over: West Indies 79-2 (Hope 19, Pooran 1)

Updated at 00.56 GMT

13 Dec 2023 00.28 GMT 7th over: West Indies 78-1 (Mayers 35, Hope 19) Rehan to Kyle Mayers. First ball is dragged down and launched over the midwicket boundary for SIX. Pressure on the young leggie. What a shot! Mayers holds the pose as he lofts a supreme drive down the ground for SIX more. Brutal elegance. Rehan comes back well with two sharply turning leggies. Bosh! Shai Hope gets in on the act and smears a length ball over mid on for the third six of the over. It’s a learning curve for the tyro spinner but that doesn’t make it any less bruising.



13 Dec 2023 00.23 GMT 6th over: West Indies 59-1 (Mayers 22, Hope 13) Curran is called back, Mills granted just the one over for the time being. Two slower balls bring two soothing dots for England. A single each to Mayers and Hope. Curran does very well to get out of the over with just three runs conceded. Powerplay complete. How long till we see some spin from Rehan? Not long at all, he’s on for the next over.



13 Dec 2023 00.20 GMT 5th over: West Indies 56-1 (Mayers 20, Hope 12) Woakes continues, after five balls he’s gone for just three runs. Can he get out of the over cheaply? No – A length ball is clubbed down the ground for SIX with a minimum of fuss by Shai Hope. West Indies have come out of the traps as well as England did, one over of the Powerplay left.



13 Dec 2023 00.16 GMT 4th over: West Indies 47-1 (Mayers 18, Hope 5) Tymal Mills comes onto bowl for England for the first time in eighteen months, he has plenty of T20 skills up his sleeve, can he showcase them here? Hmmm, a couple of wides slanted down the leg side isn’t the best of starts. Mills lets out a hearty groan at the second. Two full balls are worked for singles… Kablammo! Mills to Mayers – short ball – pulled onto the roof for SIX! What a shot, new ball please! DROP! And it is Ben Duckett who shells it! It would have been even better than the first grab but the ball smashes into his palm as he leaps to his right and comes straight out. They stick or they don’t. It’s all happening.



13 Dec 2023 00.10 GMT 3rd over: West Indies 36-1 (Mayers 10, Hope 4) Shai Hope is the new man and digs out a Woakes yorker and somehow manages to crunch it away down the ground for four. The replay of the Duckett catch is extremely enjoyable, Woakes owes him one for that as it was a poor ball outside off stump.



13 Dec 2023 00.07 GMT WICKET! Brandon King c Duckett b Woakes 22 (West Indies 32-1) Chris Woakes into the attack to replace the beleaguered Sam Curran. OH. MY. LORDY. Ben Duckett flies to his left at backward point to pull off a spectacular diving catch off a full blooded cut shot from King. Stunner!



13 Dec 2023 00.03 GMT 2nd over: West Indies 30-0 (King 21, Mayers 9) Will Jacks to bowl his workmanlike spin at the other end. Uh-Oh! He drops short and Kyle Mayers murders it, the ball lands on the roof of the stadium. That deserved everything it got. Mayers cuts for three behind point and then King skips jauntily out of his crease to skim the ball for four down the ground!



12 Dec 2023 23.59 GMT 1st over: West Indies 16-0 (King 16, Mayers) Brandon King gets the home side off to a blistering start, sending Sam Curran down the ground for four and swiping a brace of SIXES over mid-wicket. Game on!



12 Dec 2023 23.56 GMT No sooner have I sploshed some water on me teabag… the players emerge. West Indies need 172 to win!



12 Dec 2023 23.48 GMT An innings of two halves for England From 77 for no loss to 171 all out with three balls to spare. England's recent white ball approach is a variable one yielding mixed...often frustrating results #WIvENG — Aatif Nawaz (@AatifNawaz) December 12, 2023



12 Dec 2023 23.47 GMT Time to stick the kettle on and raid the fridge before West Indies start their chase. 3-19 for Andre Russell on his comeback for West Indies, balancing the attack perfectly.



Russell at his best adds so much to West Indies's side. With him at 7, and Holder, Shepherd and Hosein to follow, West Indies bat incredibly deep — Tim Wigmore (@timwig) December 12, 2023

Updated at 23.48 GMT

12 Dec 2023 23.46 GMT England all out 171! Tymal Mills gets a gossamer thin edge through to Pooran and England are all out with three deliveries to spare! What a turnaround for West Indies who were staring down the barrel with England flying 77-0 after six overs.



12 Dec 2023 23.44 GMT WICKET! Rashid b Joseph 0 (England 170-9) Rashid goes to swipe Joseph in the final over and hacks the ball onto his timbers. England nine down…



12 Dec 2023 23.42 GMT WICKET! Ahmed c Powell b Russell 1 (England 169-8) Rehan Ahmed follows shortly after, trying to smear a length ball down the ground he can only find Powell lurking ten yards in from the sponge. Russell gets two in the over and finishes his spell and his first T20I in two years with figures of 3-19. Nicely done. 19th over: England 169-8 (Woakes 2, Rashid 0)



12 Dec 2023 23.37 GMT WICKET! Livingstone b Russell 27 (England 167-7) Livingstone chops a cutter from Russell onto his stumps!

sports,Rob Smyth,2023-12-21T19:39:01+00:00,"6d ago 23.36 GMT Jos Buttler’s reaction We probably didn’t adapt quickly enough with the bat – I thought 16o w0uld have been a decent score on a used wicket. It was a fantastic bowling effort; we did well to hang in the game as long as we did. Phil Salt has had a brilliant series. We found out lots about ourselves as a team. [On the stop-clock experiment] It was only in the last game that we really noticed it. It’s good to keep the game moving.



6d ago 23.19 GMT England’s miserable white-ball year ends with another series defeat. Plenty of good has come from this series, though, most notably the performance of Phil Salt. While there are a few slots to fill, most notably at No3, they are in reasonable shape ahead of nexr year’s World Cup.

Updated at 23.20 GMT

6d ago 23.16 GMT I suppose it’s appropriate that it ended with a six, the 120th of the series. Hope played a gem of an innings there, calmly anchoring West Indies in an increasingly nervous chase with a run-a-ball 43. England fought admirably to defend a below-par total; but for Hope, they would probably have done it.

Updated at 23.34 GMT

6d ago 23.13 GMT 19.1 overs: West Indies 127-6 (Hope 37, Holder 4) Holder inside edges Woakes this far wide of leg stump for three runs. It would have been four but for an outstanding stop from Rehan Ahmed.



6d ago 23.12 GMT 19th over; West Indies 124-6 (Hope 37, Holder 1) Holder is almost run out first ball! He took a very dodgy single to mid-off and was well short of the crease when Curran just failed to gather Rashid’s throw. Nine to win from six balls, Chris Woakes to bowl them.



6d ago 23.10 GMT WICKET! West Indies 123-6 (Russell c Livingstone b Curran 3) Oh my. Russell slugs a low full toss straight down the throat of Livingstone at long-on, and England – who have been behind the game throughout this innings – are again dreaming of an improbable victory. West Indies need 10 from 7 balls.



6d ago 23.09 GMT 18.4 overs: West Indies 123-5 (Hope 37, Russell 3) Sam Curran concedes only one run from the first four balls of a superb penultimate over. The ball is getting very wet, though, so there’s a short break in play while England call for a dry towel. West Indies need 10 from 8 balls.



6d ago 23.04 GMT 18th over: West Indies 122-5 (Hope 36, Russell 3) Jos Buttler gambles by continuing with Rehan Ahmed, who has been relatively expensive. It doesn’t come off: Hope skims a back cut between short third and backward point for four to move the requirement back below a run a ball. It’s very hard to see how England can with this now.



6d ago 23.00 GMT 17th over: West Indies 114-5 (Hope 30, Russell 1) The wicket England really need is that of Shai Hope, who is quietly guiding West Indies towards the finish line.



6d ago 22.57 GMT WICKET! West Indies 113-5 (Powell c Rashid b Topley 8) England haven’t given this up. Powell edges Topley to short third man, where Rashid takes a smart low catch to his left. West Indies need 20 from 21 balls. Reece Topley (right) celebrates the dismissal of Rovman Powell. Photograph: Randy Brooks/AFP/Getty Images

Updated at 23.07 GMT

6d ago 22.54 GMT 16th over: West Indies 112-4 (Hope 29, Powell 8) Hope, who is playing an exemplary innings, opens the face to steer Rehan for his first boundary. Rehan has struggled as the series has progressed, an d later in the over Powell muscles him over long-on for six. West Indies are 21 runs away from a hat-trick of T20 series wins this year: South Africa away, India and England at home.



6d ago 22.50 GMT 15th over: West Indies 99-4 (Hope 23, Powell 1) Rashid finishes with figures of 4-0-21-2. He’s had a great series: eight wickets at 15 with an absurd economy rate of 6.26. But he’s going to end on the losing side.



6d ago 22.48 GMT WICKET! West Indies 95-4 (Rutherford c Curran b Rashid 30) Buttler brings back Rashid for his final over, knowing it’s now or never for England, and gets an immediate reward. Rutherford smashes a drive towards short extra, where Curran dives to his left to take a superb catch. It’s not the despair, Laura…



6d ago 22.45 GMT 14th over: West Indies 94-3 (Hope 19, Rutherford 30) West Indies are rushing towards a series victory. Rutherford hooks the new bowler Sam Curran for six more, and there are 11 from the over in total. Rutherford has 30 from 23 balls, Hope 19 from 28. They’re playing their roles to perfection.



6d ago 22.40 GMT 13th over: West Indies 83-3 (Hope 17, Rutherford 21) Rehan Ahmed returns, perhaps in the hope of tempting Rutherford into one big shot too many. Instead it’s Shai Hope, who is happily playing the anchor role, who faces five of the six deliveries. England are running out of time.



6d ago 22.37 GMT 12th over: West Indies 80-3 (Hope 15, Rutherford 20) England appeal unsuccessfully for caught behind when Rutherford misses a swipe at Rashid. There’s only one review left and they decide not to risk it. A good job too; there was nothing on UltraEdge. Out of nothing Rutherford launches a full ball from Rashid down the ground for six, almost knocking himself off his feet in the process. West Indies are managing an awkward chase pretty well.



6d ago 22.33 GMT 11th over: West Indies 71-3 (Hope 14, Rutherford 12) After 23 balls without a West Indian boundary, Rutherford lifts Moeen handsomely over extra cover for four. That’s an excellent shot which keeps West Indies in control of the run-chase.

Updated at 22.33 GMT

6d ago 22.28 GMT 10th over: West Indies 62-3 (Hope 12, Rutherford 5) West Indies know how dangerous Rashid is and are content to sit on him. I think that was Charles’ plan as well, but then he saw a low full toss and his brain went rogue. Time for drinks, after which West Indies need 71 from 60 balls.



6d ago 22.25 GMT Rutherford is not out! I need someone else’s glasses: it was comfortably missing leg stump and England have lost a review.



6d ago 22.25 GMT ENGLAND REVIEW FOR LBW AGAINST RUTHERFORD! This looks really close. Rutherford pushed around a legbreak from Rashid and was hit on the pad in front of middle and leg.



6d ago 22.24 GMT 9th over: West Indies 58-3 (Hope 11, Rutherford 2) Moeen replaces Rehan and rushes through a pretty good over, four singles from it. West Indies are still on top but another wicket would make things very interesting.



6d ago 22.21 GMT WICKET! West Indies 54-3 (Charles c Buttler b Rashid 27) Adil Rashid strikes straight away. On this occasion it had nothing to do with his bowling, but maybe a little to do with his aura. He accidentally bowled a very wide, dipping full toss to Charles, who clunked it low to Jos Buttler at short extra cover. Adil Rashid (right) celebrates the dismissal of Johnson Charles (left).

Updated at 22.43 GMT

6d ago 22.17 GMT 7th over: West Indies 51-2 (Charles 26, Hope 7) Rehan Ahmed’s first over disappears for 12. It started quite gently, with four singles and a two off the first five balls, but then Charles clattered a no-nonsense straight six. “We’re not going to win this, Rob,” writes Guy Hornsby. “But I’m just here to say I’m still watching for Woakes’ seam position and Rehan’s googly. That is all.”



6d ago 22.13 GMT 6th over: West Indies 39-2 (Charles 16, Hope 5) Charles mistimes a short ball from Woakes just short of Moeen in the covers. In the end Moeen does well to save the boundary. This has been a good fightback by England, with only nine runs scored in the last three overs.



6d ago 22.09 GMT 5th over: West Indies 37-2 (Charles 15, Hope 4) Topley continues, which makes sense because the spinners will be doing most of the work after the Powerplay, and concedes only three runs. He has quietly had a good series and is comfortably the most economical seamer on either side.



6d ago 22.05 GMT 4th over: West Indies 34-2 (Charles 15, Hope 1) England needed early wickets to have a realistic chance of victory. One more in the Powerplay, before they bring on Adil Rashid, would put them right back in the game.



6d ago 22.03 GMT WICKET! West Indies 33-2 (Pooran b Woakes 10) UltraEdge shows Pooran did edge that ball from Topley – but it doesn’t matter because Woakes has got him! Pooran tried to ride the bounce of an awkward delivery that cramped him for room, took the inside of an angled bat and ricocheted onto the stumps. Nicholas Pooran looks glum as his bails go flying.

Updated at 22.15 GMT

6d ago 21.59 GMT 3rd over: West Indies 30-1 (Charles 13, Pooran 9) Nicholas Pooran strolls to the crease and launches his second ball over midwicket for six. And why not. England thought he had edged the next ball to the keeper, though eventually they ran out of time to review. West Indies need 103 from 17 overs. “Evening Rob,” says Kim Thonger. “Jolly exciting this game, in a damaged sort of way. It occurs to me perhaps T20 internationals need a complete rebrand. May I propose we rename them Ecky Thump. The term was Introduced in Kung Fu Kapers, a 1975 episode of BBC comedy The Goodies. In the episode, ‘ecky thump’ is a secret Lancastrian martial art using black puddings as a weapon. I’m not suggesting we go as far introducing black puddings immediately. A phased withdrawal of the cricket bat will cause less fuss.” But what would you call The Hundred? Bloody Eck?

6d ago 21.54 GMT WICKET! West Indies 20-1 (King c Buttler b Topley 3) One down, nine to go. Brandon King slogs Topley miles in the air towards mid-on, where Buttler takes a simple catch. Jos Buttler takes the catch to dismiss Brandon King, and the first West Indies wicket is gone. Photograph: Randy Brooks/AFP/Getty Images King traipses off the pitch.

Updated at 22.14 GMT

6d ago 21.54 GMT 2nd over: West Indies 20-0 (King 3, Charles 13) Johnson Charles was playher of the match when West Indies beat England at the T20 World Cup 11 years ago. Charles walloped 84 off 56 balls that day, and he looks like he fancies something similar here. He pulls Woakes for a big six, albeit with a hint of top-edge, and glides a boundary past short third man. West Indies are off to a flyer.



6d ago 21.49 GMT 1st over: West Indies 7-0 (King 1, Charles 2) There’s some early inswing to the right-handers for Reece Topley. Brandon King survives an LBW appeal first ball – it was missing leg – before another inswinger to Johnson Charles runs away for four leg-byes. Every boundary hurts when the target is so low, even in the first over.



6d ago 21.45 GMT After a very short break, the players are back on the field.



6d ago 21.39 GMT The difference two days make Tuesday, Tarouba England 267-3, 19 sixes

Thursday, Taroura England 132 all out, five sixes

Updated at 21.45 GMT

6d ago 21.36 GMT WICKET! England 132 all out (Curran c Rutherford b Holder 12) Sam Curran clouts the next ball to long-off to end an increasingly miserable England innings. They were 109 for four after 14 overs, and then the house fell down. West Indies need 133 to win the series.

Updated at 21.38 GMT

6d ago 21.33 GMT WICKET! England 132-9 (Rashid run out 1) Adil Rashid sacrifices himself, just like in the 2019 World Cup final, so that Curran can stay on strike. Four balls remaining.



6d ago 21.31 GMT 19th over: England 129-8 (Curran 9, Rashid 1) The hat-trick ball is another attempted yorker that Rashid flicks wide of Russell for a single. He would have had three wickets in four balls had Hosein taken a tricky low chance at third man to dismiss Curran. Russell, who bowled really well, finishes with two for 25.

sports,CBS Sports Staff,2023-10-13T21:17:17+00:00,"Kentucky sports betting has thrived since retail and online sportsbooks launched in September 2023.

The betting menu for Kentuckians is exhaustive in that they are able to legally wager on all major professional, collegiate and international sports, unlike other sports betting states. With excitement building among customers in the state for Kentucky sports gambling, it's feasible that Kentucky generates over $1 billion in Kentucky sports betting handle by the end of 2023.

Sports Betting on Kentucky (and Nearby) Teams

Kentucky Wildcats: One of the most iconic college basketball programs in the nation, the Kentucky Wildcats should be an extremely popular betting option for Bluegrass State residents. The eight-time national champions have been led by legendary coach John Calipari since 2010 and they have appeared in four Final Fours during his tenure, recording a national title in 2012. The program's 2,021-637 all-time record is the best in college basketball history. Though best known for its basketball prowess, Kentucky has also found more success on the gridiron in recent years in the SEC, including a dozen bowl appearances since 2006.

Louisville Cardinals: The Wildcats have the historic edge, but Louisville basketball won the more recent national title, cutting down the nets in 2013. They've been to 10 Final Fours and own the 12th-best record (1,726-874) in college basketball history. Louisville has also become a bigger name in the college football world in the past couple decades. Well known for 2013 Heisman winner Lamar Jackson, Louisville transitioned to the ACC in 2014 and the Cardinals have finished in the AP Top 25 seven times since 2004.

Western Kentucky Hilltoppers: Though they don't have the widespread following of UK or Louisville, the Hilltoppers have a nice fanbase in the southern portion of the state and they have the overall athletic success to demand attention in the betting market. A longtime Division I-AA (now known as FCS) power, WKU fully transitioned to the FBS level in 2009 and they've had nine winning seasons since that point. In men's basketball, WKU has made the NCAA Tournament 23 times and its 1,622-720 all-time mark ranks 14th in history, just a couple spots behind Louisville.

Cincinnati Bengals: With no ""Big Four"" professional sports teams playing within state lines, many Kentucky residents look just north of the state's border to cheer on the neighboring Cincinnati Bengals. A franchise long known for its futility in the early days of existence became more of a contender under Marvin Lewis with seven playoff appearances between 2005-15. The franchise got another jolt more recently with stars such as Joe Burrow and Ja'Marr Chase leading Cincinnati to a Super Bowl appearance in 2021 and an AFC title game appearance in 2022. The Indianapolis Colts and Tennessee Titans are also NFL franchises located within short drives of portions of Kentucky.

Cincinnati Reds: The state's MLB allegiances are a bit more split with the St. Louis Cardinals also drawing a big following, particularly in the western portion of the state, but the Reds are largely considered the most popular team for Kentucky residents. The Reds won modern-era titles in 1975, 1976 and 1990, but haven't advanced past the NLCS since that point. They've largely struggled in recent years, but the 2023 team has pushed for a playoff spot all season, just in time to draw the attention of new Kentucky sports bettors.

Top Kentucky betting terms for new bettors

Against the spread: Instead of betting on an exact winner, the widely-popular spread bet levels the playing field by allowing you to wager on how many points a team will win by. In basketball, if Kentucky is the 7.5-point favorite against Louisville then Kentucky can cover the spread if it wins by 8 or more points. However, Louisville as the 7.5-point underdog can cover the spread by winning outright or losing by 7 or fewer points.

Money line: Think of this as an elevated outright bet, with odds adjusted to reflect a favored team and an underdog. If Kentucky is listed as a -200 favorite against Florida, you'd need to bet $200 to return $100 on Kentucky to win. That means that Florida as the +200 underdog would return $200 on a $100 bet if that team wins.

Outright bet: This is the easiest wager that can be placed, and it's perfect for betting on one of Kentucky's biggest sporting events: Horse racing. With an outright bet, bettors choose one athlete -- or thoroughbred -- to win an entire sporting event.

Over/Under: If team sports is more your thing, placing an Over/Under bet is the way to go. Kentucky sportsbooks will post an estimated total of both team's final scores in a game, and you wager on whether the actual final will be higher or lower than the estimate. So if the If the Over/Under for a Kentucky vs. Louisville basketball game is 125.5, you would wager on the final total being Over 126 or Under 125.

Player prop: Kentucky is one of the 18 states that allows you to place prop bets on collegiate athletes. Sportsbooks will project what a player's stat will be at the end of a game, and you will wager whether the player will end that game over or under that projection. Popular player props include how many touchdown passes a quarterback will throw or how many three-point shots a basketball player will hit.

Underdog: The underdog is the team deemed less likely to win the game based on the odds. A bet on an underdog typically yields a larger return than a bet on the favorite.

Favorite: On the other hand, a favorite is the team that is deemed more likely to win the game. Bettors often pay a premium for betting on a favorite but they're also the team that more often wins the game outright.

Consensus odds: These odds are generally defined as an average of all available betting markets. Different sportsbooks may price markets variably based on the action they've taken or their own interpretation of information.

Futures: While money line, against the spread and over/under bets are all single-game bets, futures markets encompass almost anything that falls outside of that spectrum. Futures bets include total regular-season wins, championship odds, MVP odds and more.

Parlay: This popular betting style is a little more complex. A parlay requires you to include two or more bets within a single wager, and all of your bets must win for the parlay to be a winner. For example, if you wager $100 on a three-leg parlay at 6 to 1 odds, you could win $600 if all three legs of the bet are winners.

Juice: Also known as ""The Vig"" or vigorish, juice is effectively the tax that oddsmakers charge for handling a wager. If a book determines a game is a virtual coinflip, they may price both options at -110 to give themselves a 10% rake on all the action.

Push: A push is a bet where neither the bettor or the sportsbook wins. If an over/under for total points in a football game is set at 44 and both teams combine to score exactly 44 points, the result is a push and the principle is returned to the bettor.

Live/in-game betting: Many sportsbooks now offer live/in-game wagering that allows you to make bets on several different markets in real-time. In basketball, you can bet on the outcome of a quarter, individual statistics and live-updated spreads/totals.

You can bet on sports in states like Ohio, New York, and Arizona.","2023 Kentucky online sports betting sites: Best legal sportsbooks, promos, bonuses, mobile apps, how to bet",https://www.cbssports.com/general/news/2023-kentucky-online-sports-betting-sites-best-legal-sportsbooks-promos-bonuses-mobile-apps-how-to-bet/,CBSSports.com

FanDuel Sportsbook welcome offer pros and cons

Also unlike other offers, it doesn’t matter if your initial wager wins or loses, you get the bonus either way

You don’t have to use your Bonus Bets all at once (unless you want to), as you can divide up how you use the Bonus Bets any way you like

Cons

You can’t just withdraw the Bonus Bets, but you have to wager them

What is the welcome offer at FanDuel Sportsbook VT?

Those signing up at FanDuel Sportsbook Vermont by Jan. 10, 2024 will find $100 in Bonus Bets in their accounts when the site launches on Jan. 11. In addition, FanDuel Sportsbook VT will also feature the same welcome offer it has in other states, inviting new sign-ups to bet at least $5 and get $200 in Bonus Bets. Be aware that sometimes FanDuel add perks to that offer, such as they did at the start of the NBA season when they threw in a free three-month subscription to NBA League Pass.

What can I win with the FanDuel Sportsbook welcome offer?

With the FanDuel offer, whatever you win with your Bonus Bets is yours to keep. If you can make some successful bets, that should mean a nice profit given the fact that with the prelive offer you received $100 Bonus Bets for free, and with the welcome offer you only have to make a $5 bet up front in order to receive the $200 in Bonus Bets.

What makes the FanDuel Sportsbook welcome offer special?

The FanDuel Sportsbook offer is great for many reasons. It is simple and easy to claim and use. You don’t have to make a large wager up front to receive the bonus, and it also doesn’t matter if your first bet wins or loses as you get the bonus either way. Finally, $200 in bonus bets is quite generous and if you make some winning bets you’ll be able to have a nice bankroll right away without any significant expense. And with the $100 in Bonus Bets for those signing up by Jan. 10, the offer is even more generous.

DraftKings Vermont promo code

DraftKings is likewise already known to Vermont sports fans thanks to its popular DFS site, and many will surely be gravitating to the DraftKings Sportsbook as well. DraftKings also has a prelive offer already available to Vermont users. Be aware, though, that those who accept the prelive offer will not be eligible for DraftKings' welcome offer later on.

If you use our links and sign up for a DraftKings Sportsbook VT account between now and the moment the site goes live on Jan. 11, you will receive $200 in Bonus Bets, issued as eight $25 Bonus Bets. You'll have to wager these (i.e., you can't withdraw them), and you must do so within 7 days or they'll expire.

If you choose to wait and instead take the welcome offer, you'll find DraftKings Sportsbook actually has a multi-part offer worth up to $1,200. The offer includes a deposit match bonus worth up to $1,000, a $50 Bonus Bet just for depositing at least $5, and another $150 in Bonus Bets for making a first wager of at least $5.

You also don’t have to worry about winning or losing your first wager to get a bonus as with other sites’ offers

Cons

The 20% deposit match bonus worth up to $1,000 might sound good, but with a 25x wagering requirement it is truthfully only useful to high-stakes bettors

You only get a week to use the $150 in Bonus Bets awarded for making your first wager of at least $5

You only receive winnings and not the bet amounts when you use Bonus Bets

Depending on how much in Bonus Bets you gather, you can win whatever you earn by placing successful wagers with them.

DraftKings Sportsbook outdoes other sites with multiple offers rather than just one. Also, the $200 total in Bonus Bets you can receive just for depositing and wagering $5 is the best deal around, and you don’t even have to win or lose your first bet. The deposit match bonus offer is unique as well, although not all new users will likely try to take advantage of it.

Fanatics Vermont promo code

Fanatics Sportsbook is already scheduled to launch in Vermont in Jan. 2024. We are still awaiting word on what the Fanatics Sportsbook VT welcome offer will be. The site is live in several other states

In the past, Fanatics has featured different welcome offers for new sign-ups. These have included variations on the “bet-and-get” welcome offers described above. Fanatics has featured a bet $5, get $200 in Bonus Bets offer before.

ESPN Bet Vermont promo code

ESPN Bet Sportsbook has also applied to operate an online sportsbook in Vermont, and so it could soon be among the new online wagering options for Vermont bettors as well.

ESPN Bet brings a very familiar brand to sports fans, but a relatively new one when it comes to online sports betting. After acquiring the old Barstool Sportsbook earlier in the year, ESPN Bet Sportsbook launched the rebranded site in 17 different states in Nov. 2023. The site has already begun taking advantage of various tie-ins with the renowned sports programming network which has helped in the effort to establish the site in the overall marketplace.

In other states, the ESPN Bet welcome offer has included a 100% deposit match bonus worth up to $1,000 (with a 20x wagering requirement). ESPN Bet has also run a welcome promo that invites new sign-ups to place a wager of any amount and receive $200 in Bonus Bets split into four $50 Bonus Bets.

Here are a couple of other online sports betting sites that are thriving in other states, one or both of which could potentially come to Vermont eventually.

Caesars Vermont promo code

Caesars Sportsbook has become one of the most popular online sportsbooks in the US in several states, and it should prove a favorite in Vermont as well.

sports,Kyle Bonn,2023-10-07T21:30:00+00:00,"Inter Miami were in simply too big of a hole in the MLS playoff race, one which even Lionel Messi couldn’t drag them out of.

With two matches remaining in the season, Inter Miami have been officially eliminated from the MLS playoff race, with Supporters’ Shield winners FC Cincinnati dealing the deathblow with a 1-0 victory at DRV PNK Stadium.

The match had every hallmark of what made Inter Miami a flawed side when Lionel Messi arrived. Inter Miami utterly dominated the first half, but could not find the breakthrough, instead hitting the woodwork three separate times in the opening half-hour and four overall in the match. On the other end, Drake Callender was nothing short of sensational in goal, but even his heroics were just not enough to stymie the electric counter-attack that FC Cincinnati possess.

Messi, who had missed the last four games due to injury, returned to play 35 minutes off the bench, but by the time he stepped on the pitch, Inter Miami’s early dominance in the match had come and gone. Messi played a part, but he was unable to fully change the tide of the game.

Eventually, Alvaro Barreal’s 78th-minute goal ended any hope that Inter Miami had to complete a stunning playoff charge, and the defeat coupled with CF Montreal’s big 4-1 victory over Portland means Inter Miami are officially out of the postseason running.

The Sporting News followed the Inter Miami vs. FC Cincinnati match live, providing score updates, commentary and highlights as they happened.

Inter Miami vs FC Cincinnati live updates, highlights, commentary

FULLTIME: Inter Miami 0-1 FC Cincinnati

Inter Miami are made to rue their early missed chances, as Alvaro Barreal's 78th-minute goal is enough to secure victory for FC Cincinnati.

In the process, Inter Miami are officially OUT of the MLS playoff race, as tonight's defeat coupled with CF Montreal's 4-0 victory over Portland are enough to see them eliminated from contention.

Messi joined Inter Miami with the club bottom of the Eastern Conference, and the gap was just too big to overcome. Messi's injury certainly played a role, but even so, there was just not enough room for error.

Inter Miami vs FC Cincinnati: Second Half

90+3 min: With five minutes of added time on the board, Lionel Messi draws another foul in a very dangerous position, this one much more obvious for the official to make. It's just outside the penalty area from a central position, and Messi stands over it yet again.

His effort on goal is close to finding the top-left corner, but it's just high, clipping off the very top of the crossbar. Officially the fourth time they've hit the woodwork, although this one wasn't quite as dramatic.

89th min: Lionel Messi draws a very contentious foul by Yuya Kubo whose tackle from behind looked clean but draws a whistle regardless. Messi's delivery from a deep central position is floated in and headed out by Matt Miazga for a corner.

The ensuing set-piece is played short and eventually comes to Messi whose deep delivery is seeking the far corner but nervously tapped wide by Roman Celentano. Eventually, a foul by Messi ends the chance and leaves Santiago Arias rolling around on the ground.

88th min: Two more changes for FC Cincinnati as Dominique Badji enters for Luciano Acosta, whose night is done a few minutes early despite trailing by a goal in the Golden Boot race. Malik Pinto also comes on for Brandon Vazquez.

Teammates Acosta and Aaron Boupendza are jawing at each other as the change is made, which might be an alarming sign for FC Cincinnati with the playoffs on the horizon.

84th min: Roman Celentano absorbs a yellow card for time wasting as he stands over a goal kick, much to the delight of the home crowd.

79th min: GOAL! FC CINCINNATI! Drake Callender makes another sensational save, but this time he can't keep Inter Miami level! Callender parries Yuya Kubo's initial effort, but he drives it right into the path of Alvaro Barreal, and he buries the follow-up low into the far corner, and now Inter Miami are in very hot water!

CF Montreal are leading the Portland Timbers 3-0, and therefore Inter Miami must win or they are officially OUT of the playoff race!

Álvaro Barreal off the rebound to give @fccincinnati the lead late against Inter Miami. pic.twitter.com/DpZEQ2O01H — Major League Soccer (@MLS) October 8, 2023

76th min: Two more changes for Inter Miami, as Josef Martinez is curiously withdrawn, replaced by Nick Stefanelli. Robert Taylor also enters for DeAndre Yedlin. They have to win to stay alive in the MLS playoff race.

67th min: Chance, FC Cincinnati! ANOTHER BONKERS SAVE BY DRAKE CALLENDER! HE'S UNBEATABLE TONIGHT! Aaron Boupendza crosses to Brandon Vazquez on the counter, and while the latter is clean through on goal, Callender comes across his goal to make a sensational stop!

The flag goes up, meaning it won't count as a save, but the replay looked incredibly close, so Callender's stop means that VAR does not have a chance to intervene.

65th min: Chance, FC Cincinnati! Inter Miami have hit the post three times, but now it's FC Cincinnati who have struck the woodwork! Brandon Vazquez gets his head to a corner but it comes off the post.

64th min: Inter Miami have to remain wary of the vicious FC Cincinnati counter-attack, and here a lovely Luciano Acosta switch laterally across the top of the penalty area finds Alvaro Barreal in space, but his hit is blocked.

Pat Noonan makes his second change of the match, bringing Yuya Kubo on for Junior Moreno in midfield.

58th min: Lionel Messi's influence has been immediate, and he earns a dangerous free-kick just outside the penalty area, well within his range. Messi appears to be struggling to get good footing on this field, but it's the shirt pull from Miazga which brings him down.

Messi takes it but puts it way over the crossbar. A bit rusty?

57th min: Jean Mota has a shot from distance, and it looks to be a vicious knuckler with some dip, but it goes just wide.

55th min: HERE COMES LIONEL MESSI! He will enter with around 35 minutes to save Inter Miami's season, replacing Tomas Aviles in a very attacking change. Jean Mota also comes on to replace David Ruiz, which is harsh as the young midfielder had been very good.

50th min: Chance, FC Cincinnati! DRAKE CALLENDER MAKES A MASSIVE DOUBLE SAVE! FC Cincinnati are RIGHT on the doorstep, but he comes up huge twice! Aaron Boupendza is the most aggrieved, as his follow-up came from directly in front of the goal but he was stymied by Callender's outstretched right foot!

47th min: Luciano Acosta is fouled on the edge of the attacking third, and it gives FC Cincinnati a free-kick early in the second half. Alvaro Barreal's delivery is floated way high in the air and falls to the far post, but after a nervy moment it's cleared.

Lionel Messi begins to warm up on the touchline, and he may be brought on soon to help Inter Miami save their postseason chances.

Kickoff: The second half is underway, and there are no changes from Inter Miami, which means Lionel Messi remains on the bench for now. With their playoff hopes now squarely on the line, it's a huge call from Gerardo Martino not to bring Messi on now, and it could speak to how fit he truly is.

FC Cincinnati make one change, as Sergio Santos comes off, replaced by Aaron Boupendza up front.

HALFTIME: Inter Miami 0-0 FC Cincinnati

Needing victory in this match to ensure they remain in the MLS playoff picture, Inter Miami completely dominated the confirmed 2023 regular season champs but somehow did not manage to capitalize on their overwhelming pressure. Inter Miami were so unlucky not to cash in on multiple occasions, hitting the woodwork an insane three times, all in the first 30 minutes. Lionel Messi may yet have a job to do tonight, currently available off the bench.

FC Cincinnati had one really good look that they missed as well but otherwise were on their heels the entire 45 minutes. Head coach Pat Noonan tells the broadcast he feels FC Cincinnati had ""a lack of courage on the ball"" that half, ""as bad as its been all year.""

Elsewhere, Inter Miami will be nervous about other results from around the league. Most painful is the 2-0 lead for CF Montreal over Portland, which would be a big blow to Inter Miami, meaning they would be eliminated with anything less than a win tonight.

Inter Miami vs FC Cincinnati: First Half

43rd min: There's a goal mouth scrap that sees Roman Celentano scrambling wildly on the doorstep as the ball bounces around awkwardly, but nobody can get on the end of it for Inter Miami.

38th min: While Inter Miami haven't generated any clear-cut chances since the Celentano save on the half-hour mark, they've remained in complete control of this match. The broadcast shows Lionel Messi on the bench, and he looks very antsy, like he wants to enter the game badly.

Some Inter Miami players are called off the touchline to warm up, but Messi isn't one of them.

30th min: Chance, Inter Miami! Facundo Farias forces Roman Celentano into a full-stretch save! A right-footed blast sees the FC Cincinnati goalkeeper make his first big stop. It's an utter siege from Inter Miami through the opening half-hour! Supporters' Shield winners FC Cincinnati have barely survived thus far!

28th min: Obinna Nwobodo is booked for a very late tackle on Facundo Farias in transition. He has to watch himself, as he gives the referee a sarcastic applause, which is a good way to draw the official's ire and get sent off.

26th min: Inter Miami have another good set-piece opportunity as the rain begins to fall hard at Inter Miami. It's really coming down in South Florida, and more could be on the way. Sergio Busquets takes it and blasts it straight into the wall.

Inter Miami fans chant ""Mess, Messi"" as they have a free kick! pic.twitter.com/VkyvULPUHp — Mundo Albiceleste ⭐🌟⭐🇦🇷 (@MundoAlbicelest) October 8, 2023

24th min: Chance, Inter Miami! THEY'VE HIT THE WOODWORK AGAIN! Benja Cremaschi is fed through on a one-two with Josef Martinez, and with the outside of his right foot, he bends it around Matt Miazga but clatters the near post. The THIRD time Inter Miami have hit the bar in under a half-hour! How unlucky??

22nd min: Chance, Inter Miami! Inter Miami hit the woodwork again! Josef Martinez, who has been electric so far, rips a shot from a tight angle about 15 yards out, and while it beats Roman Celentano, it also clatters the far post and deflects out! So close again for the hosts!

22' | Josef takes a chance and it hits the post🤯#MIAvCIN | 0-0 pic.twitter.com/BbD0dWKnzP — Inter Miami CF (@InterMiamiCF) October 8, 2023

20th min: Josef Martinez's hold-up play creates a chance for a charging Benja Cremaschi, but he puts his driven effort wide.

14th min: Inter Miami have a very dangerous free-kick as Josef Martinez is bundled over from behind by Junior Moreno. The ball is shaded right of the middle just inches outside the penalty area, and it'll be Facundo Farias to take with his fellow Argentine Lionel Messi on the bench. The floated delivery find the head of a teammate, but the shot is weak and easily caught by Roman Celentano.

12th min: Chance, FC Cincinnati! WHAT A SAVE DRAKE CALLENDER! Cincinnati hit on the counter again, as Brandon Vazquez brilliantly settles a ball from deep and finds Sergio Santos. The Cincinnati forward is tackled by Tomas Aviles as he gets his shot off, and that may have put him off just enough to allow Callender to make a diving, full-stretch stop.

End-to-end stuff so far!

9th min: Chance, Inter Miami! Oh no, Tomas Aviles has missed with the goal gaping! On a corner, the initial header drops in Aviles's lap, and he produces a finish of real quality, whipping his leg horizontally at the bouncing ball up near his hip, but he crashes the shot off the crossbar! It had serious pace and should have bulged the net!

Chance, FC Cincinnati! Just seconds after Aviles hit the woodwork, FC Cincinnati counter with real venom, and Sergio Santos puts his chance wide! He's pressured while making a one-on-one run, and the delivery from the right flashes wide of the near post as he slides to meet it.

Both teams will believe they should be in front!

8th min: Inter Miami have held the attacking possession in the opening stage of the match, looking to break down FC Cincinnati early, but Matt Miazga holds firm before he's fouled as Josef Martinez undercuts him in the air.

3rd min: An early free-kick for Inter Miami from about 35 yards away shaded way right, and with Lionel Messi on the bench, Noah Allen stands over the ball. The play is off the training ground, as his delivery goes vertically to try and create a lateral cross opportunity for DeAndre Yedlin, but it's overcooked and completely wasted over the end line. Yikes.

Kickoff: The match is under way at DRV PNK Stadium! One club's status for the postseason is as assured as possible, while the other team's status is far from certain.

5 mins to kickoff: While there is no active protest happening from the Inter Miami supporter section, they are also taking more muted measures to make their feelings known. They have made a collective effort not to be their usual cheerful selves before kickoff, sitting quietly instead of waving flags and making noise.

With such a massive game on hand, this is a very clear sign of frustration with the enormous increase in ticket prices next season. Inter Miami's home field advantage tonight will be significantly hampered.

Not sure how much can be appreciated via the photo, but La Familia — Inter Miami’s supporters’ groups — are mostly sitting here before kickoff.

15 mins to kickoff: Interestingly, while tonight's match should kick off without any negative attention, it seems the club just managed to get off the ground without a hitch. According to Michelle Kaufman of the Miami Herald, the supporter groups had planned a protest regarding 2024 season ticket prices, but the club offered to meet with them this coming week so they called it off until that can take place.

A reminder, this match officially kicks off at 7:39 p.m. ET so there will be a slight delay from the advertised 7:30 p.m. time.

30 mins to kickoff: Lionel Messi's availability for Inter Miami is a welcome sight for the club, as they take the field today with their backs against the wall. Inter Miami must win tonight to ensure they remain alive in the playoff race. A draw or a loss, however, would see them vulnerable to outside results.

If Inter Miami do not win, two of the following three possible outcomes would trigger their elimination from playoff contention: CF Montreal beats Portland Timbers; NYCFC wins versus D.C. United; and Chicago Fire picks up points against Charlotte FC.

Those are all conceivable results, and therefore Inter Miami will wish to keep it in their own hands just a little longer. They'll eventually need other results to go their way to climb the table, but for now, their survival is solely up to them.

45 mins to kickoff: Lineups are in, and Lionel Messi is on the bench for Inter Miami.

For FC Cincinnati, Luciano Acosta starts despite the match being meaningless from a tangible standpoint, understandable considering he is chasing the Golden Boot. Ian Murphy comes in for Yerson Mosquera at the back, while Aaron Boupendza is rotated out up front with Brandon Vazquez and Sergio Santos starting together up front.

1 hour to kickoff: With lineups still yet to be released, let's take a look at one player who is, in fact, an MVP candidate for this year.

FC Cincinnati forward Luciano Acosta is one back of Denis Bouanga for the MLS goal scoring lead with two matches left, sitting on 16 for the year. With 13 assists alongside that, his 29 total goal contributions are best in the league, above the 27 of Thiago Almada and 25 of Hany Mukhtar. Acosta ranks as the second-highest rated player by WhoScored this season across all of Major League Soccer.

You wonder if he's going to be rested tonight with the Supporters' Shield and No. 1 seed locked up. It would be devastating for him to be injured in a meaningless game, regardless of the opponent.

""Luciano Acosta's the MVP... He's been an unbelievable player for us this year."" @fccincinnati goalkeeper @roman_413 had nothing but praise for @LuchoAcosta94 and Pat Noonan 🟠🔵 pic.twitter.com/Xyp2ozr7n5 — CBS Sports Golazo ⚽️ (@CBSSportsGolazo) October 3, 2023

1 hour 15 mins to kick: Lionel Messi was nominated for not only MLS Newcomer of the Year for the 2023 season, but also 2023 MLS MVP.

Laughable doesn't even begin to describe that blatant PR move, considering that most of the damage Messi has done for Inter Miami has come in Cup competitions. He has one goal and two assists in 247 minutes of play in actual MLS competition. Lionel Messi has been fun, but let's hope the league doesn't make a mockery of itself by actually giving Messi either honor.

1 hour 30 mins to kick: As if Inter Miami's predicament tonight wasn't difficult enough, requiring a victory to keep their playoff hopes alive, it will have to come against the best team in Major League Soccer through the 2023 regular season.

FC Cincinnati won the Supporters' Shield as the regular season champion, confirmed on Wednesday despite suffering defeat. It's been an exceptional season for the club, and they won't stop here just because they have nothing tangible left to gain over the final few matches.

1 hour 45 mins to kick: It's Fan Appreciation Night at DRV PNK Stadium, where they're giving out Inter Miami bucket hats to the first few fans through the gates.

That's nice and all, but the best way to appreciate the fans would be to not price out the loyal supporters from season tickets next year. Instead, Inter Miami has jacked 2024 membership rates to put the club amongst some of the most expensive tickets in not just MLS, but the world.

While there will certainly be folks who can afford those high-demand tickets, many of those individuals won't be the same fans who have supported the club from its inception in 2020. This means Inter Miami have chosen to secure maximum profit at the expense of its fanbase, and a high turnover amongst the regular in-person support from this season to next is likely.

2 hours to kickoff: A report from well-connected Argentine journalist Gaston Edul last night indicated that Inter Miami are likely to have Lionel Messi back for this match in some capacity. Edul reported that ""the idea is for Leo Messi to get minutes when Inter Miami plays FC Cincinnati"".

That makes it sound like Messi will only be available off the bench, but it's better than nothing to have a game-changer like him available at all.

Inter Miami vs FC Cincinnati lineups & team news

There was a report that Lionel Messi could finally make his return from injury, and while it felt unlikely that Messi would start three days after missing out entirely, he appears on the bench today and could be available for a second half appearance if required.

Jordi Alba remains sidelined with a hamstring injury, missing since his injury just minutes before Messi, and without a publicly known timeline for a return. Also missing is striker Leonardo Campana who was absent from the midweek defeat to the Chicago Fire with a muscle injury, although Gerardo Martino described his issue as ""minor.""

Important midfielder Gregore, who has missed most of the season with a foot injury, is back in training and should return to the field at some point, although when is not known. Defender Tomas Aviles is back from suspension and starts in the three center-back system.

Inter Miami starting lineup (5-3-2): Callender (GK) — Yedlin, Aviles, Kryvtsov, Miller, Allen — Ruiz, Busquets, Cremaschi — Farias, Martinez.

Inter Miami subs (12): Dos Santos (GK), Sailor, Taylor, Mota, Arroyo, Ulloa, Robinson, Messi, Stefanelli.

Defender Alvas Powell is suspended for the match after being sent off against the New York Red Bulls last time out, with Santiago Arias stepping in at right-back.

FC Cincinnati are otherwise light on availability concerns, with only a leg injury for Arquimides Ordonez and a long-term injury to young midfielder Stiven Jimenez to worry about.

Talisman forward Luciano Acosta was partially rested midweek, coming off the bench to score the team's only goal against the Red Bulls in 32 minutes of play, so he is ready to go as he chases the league's Golden Boot award. Also rested midweek was Alvaro Barreal who leads the team in minutes and also logged just 32 of them on Wednesday.

FC Cincinnati starting lineup (5-3-2): Celentano (GK) — Arias, Hagglund, Miazga, Murphy, Barreal — Nwobodo, Acosta, Moreno — Vazquez, Santos.

FC Cincinnati subs (9): Kann (GK), Kubo, Mosquera, Angulo, Badji, Pinto, Halsey, Valenzuela, Boupendza.

sports,Andy Hunter,2023-11-24T22:30:32+00:00,"Sean Dyche is confident Everton’s season will not be derailed by their 10-point penalty for breaching Premier League financial rules but has warned his players that they cannot rely on the club’s appeal to rescue them from another relegation battle.

The Everton manager said he was shocked and aggrieved by an independent commission’s decision to impose the biggest sporting sanction in Premier League history for a £19.5m overspend in 2021-22. Dyche was ill while on holiday in Dubai when informed of the punishment by Everton’s director of football, Kevin Thelwell. He described the deduction as both disproportionate and unjust.

Dyche addressed the first-team squad at Everton’s Finch Farm training ground on Friday morning, once they had all returned from international duty. Players reacted to last Friday’s news by sharing defiant messages on their WhatsApp group. After a run of six wins in nine games in all competitions, that had lifted Everton to 14th in the table prior to being plunged back to 19th, their resolve to maintain momentum and haul the club out of danger was relayed to the manager at Friday’s meeting.

“The feeling was very positive in the sense of building on the mentality that’s been there lately,” said Dyche. “We all spoke about that, saying this hasn’t changed it and it’s building regardless of this current situation. The players are clear-minded. They have their WhatsApp group and when the news broke they put it straight on there: ‘Right lads, just another challenge, this is how we take it on’. The group is taking ownership and that’s a powerful thing.

“I got from them the sense that: ‘What we’re building, we don’t let anything disrupt that and we don’t let anything get in the way’. You can’t guarantee it’s made a difference [to players’ resolve] yet because we haven’t played any games. All I know is that the players know what we’re doing. They’ve referenced that to me probably for the last six weeks.”

Everton’s appeal against the 10-point deduction will be heard by a different three-person panel before the end of the season. Dyche, however, wants his team to forget about the appeal and accept the reality of being joint-bottom of the Premier League on four points. That outlook, he believes, will help Everton focus on hauling themselves out of the relegation zone.

On the prospect of survival, Dyche said: “I’ve never lacked confidence in my own ability, in my staff’s ability or the players’ ability. I’ve never lacked confidence since I’ve been here and, let’s face it, I’ve had some pretty tough times. But it’s not just about confidence. You’ve got to win games, and this is just another big challenge.

“It is currently a momentary thing because we don’t know what the appeal brings, we don’t know how that changes things again. But until that period, and I have made it clear to the players, be under no illusions because there are no guarantees things will change so we have to commit to what’s going on now as if that is the reality. It might be changed but, until it’s changed, we have to commit to this reality. There are no guarantees that what goes before guarantees what comes next. We have to keep pushing like we have been doing because we have lost 10 points and we have to get them back as quick as we can.”

Everton fans have a series of protests against the Premier League planned for Sunday’s home game against Manchester United, when a win could possibly lift Dyche’s team out of the bottom three. After several years of division at Goodison Park, certainly in terms of the fanbase and the club’s hierarchy, the punishment has created a collective siege mentality that Dyche wants his team to utilise.

He said: “I couldn’t wait [for Sunday] anyway because obviously we are on a good run of form – forget about all this. But I will be amazed if the Evertonians are not right on song. I’ll be very surprised if they are not, knowing what I do. I don’t know them yet but I am learning about Evertonians and how they commit to the club and the cause. I’m getting deeper in my knowledge of that and I’ll be very surprised if they are not right there with us. It doesn’t guarantee you’ll win but it gives you a better chance when they are right behind the players going: ‘Come on then, let’s take it on again’.

“I sense that the underbelly, the fans with the depth of knowledge about Everton who remember the hard-fought years and what it has been built upon – not every Evertonian just knows moneyed years – they remember when they had to fight and work to build a team and a mentality. I think they can sense it again. That’s what I think. I think they sense we are getting back to an earthiness, a determined Everton group of players who will really have a go.”

Dyche declined to comment on the implications of Everton’s punishment for Manchester City, who have been charged with 115 financial breaches by the Premier League, and deny any wrongdoing, and Chelsea, who are also under investigation by the football authorities.","Everton players and fans will be fired up by points penalty, asserts Sean Dyche",https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/nov/24/everton-players-and-fans-will-be-fired-up-by-points-penalty-asserts-sean-dyche,The Guardian
sports,Kyle Bonn,2023-10-12T21:11:00+00:00,"Argentina continue their start to CONMEBOL 2026 World Cup qualifying with a home date against Paraguay, the first of two qualifiers for the world champions in this international break.

Lionel Messi has been dealing with fitness concerns the past few weeks, missing significant time for his club Inter Miami, but he is on the roster and expected to play a part for the national team. According to a report from Argentina, Messi will not start tonight's match, but he is likely to play much or all of the second half.

He is helping to usher in a youth movement up front for Argentina, with Julian Alvarez and Alejandro Garnacho considered the future of the forward line. With Angel Di Maria not fit for duty this month, that will be even more in the spotlight here and in the follow-up in Peru.

Paraguay were not close to qualifying for the last World Cup, unable to reach a FIFA tournament since 2010. However, with the 2026 World Cup field — and by extension, qualifying across all federations — expanding this cycle, Los Guaranies will consider themselves real contenders for a spot and thus points will be at a premium in every match.

Argentina vs Paraguay starting lineups & team news

Argentina head coach Lionel Scaloni named a bloated 36-man squad for the matches against Paraguay and Peru this month, but Angel Di Maria, Paulo Dybala, and Juan Foyth were forced to withdraw due to injury. Lisandro Martinez is also unavailable after having to undergo another foot operation.

Now that Inter Miami's playoff run is officially over, Argentina can feel a little better about deploying Lionel Messi at full 90-minute use despite his recent fitness issues, knowing his club season is nearly over and he'll have months of rest upcoming. Messi missed the last match against Bolivia, and missed four Inter Miami games after, but he returned for a half-hour of action in their final fixture before the international break. However, he doesn't start, but is reportedly fit enough to come off the bench for most or all of the second half.

Nicolas Tagliafico started both matches in September, and while Marcos Acuna is back with the team following an injury, the former retains his starting spot. Messi's club teammate Facundo Farias was also included on the roster but it'd be surprising if he saw the field.

Argentina starting lineup (4-3-3): E. Martinez (GK) — Molina, Romero, Otamendi, Tagliafico — De Paul, Mac Allister, E. Fernandez — J. Alvarez, L. Martinez, N. Gonzalez.

New Paraguay head coach Daniel Garnero, making his debut, has rung the changes after falling to Venezuela last time out, making five alterations to that starting lineup. The entire midfield is swapped out, while Adam Bareiro takes over at striker, earning his debut international cap in place of Gabriel Avalos.

Forward Miguel Almiron is Paraguay's most prominent goalscoring threat and is in good form, with three goals in his past five matches for Newcastle United.

Paraguay have questions at goalkeeper, as mainstay Antony Silva has been phased out, leaving three inexperienced internationals currently on the roster. New York Red Bulls starter Carlos Coronel earned his first two caps in the September matches and he remains in net here. Lionel Messi's Inter Miami teammate Diego Gomez was named to the Paraguay roster but was forced to withdraw due to injury.

Paraguay starting lineup (5-4-1): C. Coronel (GK) — I. Ramirez, G. Gomez, Balbuena, Alonso, Espinoza — R Sanchez, Campuzano, Almiron, Bareiro — Sosa.

sports,The New York Times,2023-11-15T21:40:47+00:00,"Chelsea Women had created a frenzy. On Nov. 4, the English club released a statement saying their coach Emma Hayes was leaving at the end of the season to “pursue a new opportunity outside of the Women’s Super League and club football.” Hayes had just entered her second decade in charge of the club, and few knew where she would land next.

Advertisement

That same day The Athletic, among others, reported that Hayes’ next job would be with the U.S. women’s national team, leading a four-time World Cup and Olympic gold medal-winning program into a new era. On Tuesday, U.S. Soccer made her appointment official.

Hayes, who previously won six WSL titles in England, will become the 10th full-time coach of the U.S., but not until her final season with Chelsea is complete next May. Sporting director Matt Crocker made the final decision to hire Hayes after a search process that began in August, following the team’s surprising exit in the round of 16 at the World Cup and the subsequent departure of head coach Vlatko Andonovski.

“She has tremendous energy and an insatiable will to win,” U.S. Soccer president Cindy Parlow Cone said in a statement. “Her experience in the USA, her understanding of our soccer landscape and her appreciation of what it means to coach this team makes her a natural fit for this role and we could not be more pleased to have her leading our women’s national team forward.”

Though Hayes is seen as one of the world’s top coaches in women’s soccer, the appointment still comes as something of a surprise. Here’s how the deal got done.

Details of the deal

At least part of the surprise surrounding Hayes’ hire – and the six-month runway before she officially takes charge – is down to U.S. Soccer’s own messaging. Crocker, in a September meeting with U.S. reporters along with Cone and U.S. Soccer CEO J.T. Batson, said he hoped to have a new head coach in place by December.

But the initial contact with Hayes was made a couple of months ago, early into the search, with all three top-level executives from U.S. Soccer involved in those talks. The trio also described the interview process to journalists in that September meeting – a U.S. soccer statement describes it as involving “psychometrics and abstract reasoning tests, in-depth discussions of strategy, coaching philosophy and the current player pool, as well as evaluation on the reactions to pressure, culture-building and interactions with players and staff.” USMNT coach Gregg Berhalter went through a similar process, including an abstract reasoning test, when he was re-hired by Crocker earlier in 2023.

The hiring process included multiple rounds of evaluation, with the list of candidates becoming smaller each time. The first pass was driven purely by data, which was then whittled down to a double-digit list Crocker was considering as of September, and then a final shortlist, which also included Tony Gustavsson, head coach of Australia. Multiple sources confirmed both Hayes and Gustavsson flew to the U.S. for interviews.

One source who was briefed on the situation said the federation had also checked in on the availability of Sarina Wiegman, despite clear messaging from both the English FA and Wiegman herself in August. “I’m staying out of it. I’ve heard it (from the press officer) but no, I’m with England and I’m really happy with England, and I have a contract until 2025,” Wiegman said. A representative from her camp declined to comment for this story.

Crocker said in September that the final interviews would include lengthy technical and tactical assessments, as well as questions to determine the candidates’ cultural fit. He and the federation stayed fairly consistent on their desired start date since the head coach role opened in August, but that became one of the major concessions made by U.S. Soccer in selecting Hayes.

Hayes will remain exclusively with Chelsea through the end of their WSL campaign and the Champions League season. She will not work with the U.S. in international windows.

“I’m here until the end,” she said in her press conference on Friday. “I haven’t died, I haven’t gone anywhere. I’m here, doing this job. My full focus and attention is on what I do for Chelsea.”

Advertisement

Hayes could be tied up with Chelsea as late as May 25 if the London club makes the Champions League final; notably, an international window that would theoretically be Hayes’ first in charge begins just two days later, on May 27.

However, there are ways in which the arrangement will benefit U.S. Soccer. The federation won’t owe any compensation to Chelsea, and Hayes will be fully committed to the program, with a move to Chicago in the works for next year following the completion of her time in London. Eventually, she’s expected to relocate to Atlanta thanks to U.S. Soccer’s planned combined headquarters and national training facility in Georgia. As of yet, there’s no targeted date set for the move.

Hayes, too, will benefit in ways other than compensation and prestige. She spoke to reporters about looking forward to spending more time with her five-year-old son, Harry. She has never been to one of his sports days, picked him up from school or taken him to an after-school club and she wants to do that.

The main visible wrinkle in the process was Chelsea’s surprise move of announcing Hayes’ departure on Saturday, Nov. 4. With the contract not yet finalized and U.S. Soccer board approval still needed, Chelsea issued their statement at 11 a.m. ET in the U.S. in which it noted she would leave at the end of the season “to pursue a new opportunity outside of the WSL and club football.” The club feared that the news was starting to leak and wanted to share the news on its own. This began the race to confirm Hayes had been selected as the USWNT head coach.

Talks between U.S. Soccer and Hayes’ representatives continued even after Chelsea’s press release. The federation’s board convened late on Saturday, Nov. 4 to approve the selection, even without the final details of the contract settled or signed.

At the end of it all, the sides have agreed to a deal that will make Hayes the highest-paid women’s football coach in the world — though her salary is not tied to equal compensation with Berhalter. While her salary is in the same range as the USMNT head coach, it’s thought to be a reflection of the market value for Hayes. With reports that Chelsea was prepared to quadruple her salary to keep her, Hayes herself danced around the details in her first media availability with the club.

“I believe in private conversations,” she said. “Of course, I’m disappointed to hear things being said in the press. I want to make sure I maintain my own professionalism in everything I do.”

U.S Soccer’s annual financial reports reveal the salaries of their head coaches and other executives. While Berhalter received a new contract this year, his previous deal that ran from April 2021 to March 2022, earned him $1.6 million, including $300,000 in bonuses. During that same time, Andonovski earned $446,495, of which only $50,000 was bonus money. With Hayes expected to earn close to $2 million per year in her deal, this will likely create a knock-on effect for other international women’s coaches negotiating their next contracts.

U.S. Soccer’s rollout of their new head coach has not been an easy one for the federation’s communications staff, considering that Hayes is essentially unavailable for any formal ceremonies or media appearances until her time with Chelsea is complete.

“This is a huge honor to be given the opportunity to coach the most incredible team in world football history,” she said in a statement on Tuesday. “The feelings and connection I have for this team and for this country run deep. I’ve dreamed about coaching the USA for a long time so to get this opportunity is a dream come true. I know there is work to do to achieve our goals of winning consistently at the highest levels. To get there, it will require dedication, devotion and collaboration from the players, staff and everyone at the U.S. Soccer Federation.”

Looking ahead for the USWNT

Hayes’ appointment will have an immediate impact, even if she’s not immediately present. The particulars around timing and the plan moving forward have been one of the areas of discussion between Hayes and her representatives, Chelsea and U.S. Soccer that has continued through the start of November.

Unless the situation changes drastically, Hayes will only have two camps, including four friendlies, with the USWNT ahead of the 2024 Olympics in Paris. She’ll miss three international windows between Tuesday’s announcement and her planned start date, including the 2024 CONCACAF Gold Cup in February and March.

U.S. Soccer has a plan in place for the transition. Current interim head coach Twila Kilgore will continue in the role through May and will remain as a permanent assistant coach under Hayes after the swap is complete. U.S. Soccer said that Kilgore and the rest of the technical staff are working on a handoff plan for Hayes.

“This is a unique situation, but the team is in safe hands with Twila,” Crocker said. “Her stewardship will be crucial during this period as we are focused on success at the Olympics.

It’s still an extremely tight turn for the Olympics, with 18 days for Hayes to get situated with the team ahead of the tournament, between the two international windows from May 27 to June 4, then July 8 to 16. The Olympic tournament will start on July 25.

There are, of course, logistical questions about roster selection over the next few months. Some of those may be answered relatively soon, with the roster for the upcoming camp that begins at the end of the month imminent. The greater challenge will likely be ongoing player evaluation over the next six months, at a time of great transition within the squad. The specifics of how that will work without Hayes’ involvement remain a mystery. It would be understandable for players to feel like they are still auditioning for an absent director until May rolls around, while still knowing they must perform at the USWNT standard.

Along these same lines, there is at least the suggestion that the federation could be willing to sacrifice coherent preparation for this upcoming Olympic tournament to focus more on the longer-term project of the 2027 World Cup. That itself represents a marked change from the expectations and pressure of constant performance and winning that the team is known for.

Is that a good or a bad thing? Perhaps a little bit of both. The USWNT shouldn’t be ruled out of contention for the Olympics by any stretch, but this past summer’s World Cup did reveal that the problems facing the team are far more foundational than just poor coaching decisions or the strange midfield chemistry. Balancing realism with the pressure to win feels like a much more sustainable path forward for the USWNT.

What’s next for Chelsea?

Questions surrounding Hayes’ future have cropped up previously in her tenure at Chelsea. She was linked to several jobs in the men’s English Football League in the past and has always been interested in managing Spain’s national team, although there was never an official conversation with Spain’s federation. So it was a question of when, not if, Hayes would leave. Still, news of her decision came as a shock to her staff and players.

A few staff members were told on the morning of Nov. 4 before Chelsea’s away game at Aston Villa kicked off at 12.30 p.m. UK time. Most of the other staff members found out with the players in the post-match meeting minutes before the official club statement, which Hayes had no hand in writing and did not even see before publication, was released at 3 p.m.

England and Chelsea captain Millie Bright was “devastated,” and most players were understandably sad — many of whom owe their career progression to Hayes — but know they still have a job to do this season.

“It’s been a bit of a whirlwind. As a player and a person, I was devastated. I’ve been here nine years under Emma and the things I’ve learned,” Bright said. “She’s a mentor, a coach, a friend, a life coach. It’s more than just football playing under her.”

Hayes’ American assistant Denise Reddy, born in New Jersey, is likely to follow her across the pond. The former United States Under-20 coach has remained faithful to her friend of 20 years and voluntarily quit her job as assistant at Chicago Red Stars in 2010 when Hayes was fired as head coach. Chelsea’s general manager Paul Green will stay at the club. It is unclear whether any other members of Chelsea’s technical staff are expected to depart.

GO DEEPER What next for Chelsea after Emma Hayes?

The relentless nature of managing a club takes its toll and after what will be 12 years at Chelsea come the end of the season, Hayes, a single parent whose father died last month, decided that it was the right time for a change, professionally and personally.

“The biggest factors are my son, leaving at the top and giving the club enough time to be able to transition without there being too much disruption,” she said in her press conference.

The club has received several applications regarding Hayes’ replacement but has not yet started an official recruitment process. She will meet with Chelsea’s technical directors once a week to create a succession plan and will have a say in who takes the job after her.

There is the possibility of Hayes retaining a connection to the club via some sort of ambassadorial role, but it’s likely contingent upon a lack of conflict with the USWNT role and responsibilities. Under American Todd Boehly’s co-ownership, expanding Chelsea’s profile and reach in the U.S. would make sense, especially with USWNT internationals Catarina Macario and Mia Fishel playing their club football there — and CBS Sports holding WSL rights.

There is, for now, an immediate task for Hayes to focus on. Chelsea faces off against Real Madrid on Wednesday for their first match of the UWCL Champions League group stage. Her full American arrival will not come for another half a year after that.

sports,David Hytner,2023-10-20T21:30:28+00:00,"It was the moment when Reece James simply could not handle the frustration. Named by Mauricio Pochettino as the Chelsea captain, James had not played since the opening weekend draw with Liverpool at Stamford Bridge when he injured a hamstring. Now, he seethed from the sideline as his team lost 1-0 at home to Aston Villa, a game in which his replacement, Malo Gusto, was controversially sent off.

It was 24 September, Chelsea’s second home Premier League defeat on the spin after the one against Nottingham Forest and they were booed off again. James would lose his cool with an official in the tunnel and, when a Football Association charge was announced three days later for abusive conduct, it felt like only a matter of time before he was given a one-match ban.

It did not come in time for Chelsea’s visit to Fulham on 2 October, when James was still injured. That would have been too simple. Rather for their next game at Burnley on 7 October when, according to Pochettino, James was back in contention for selection.

The 23-year-old was not called up by England for the internationals over this past window and the idea was that he would work to be ready for Saturday’s home derby against Arsenal. And yet there have been stories of an injury setback, even that he may need surgery to get to the root of his hamstring issues.

Pochettino bustled his way through those questions on Friday and the best read on James’s status was that he would be back in the squad for Arsenal, most likely as a substitute. Gusto is available again after his own suspension. “It [James’s hamstring] is much better,” Pochettino said. “He is progressing well, still not at his best, 100%. But maybe to help the team at some point …. maybe, he is close to be there.”

It has not been straightforward and it seems to remain that way. Yet there were two takeaways from Pochettino on James – with a common thread running through them. First, James could be like a coiled spring when he finally returns to action. And second, Pochettino was in no mood to criticise him for his indiscipline. On the contrary. He was happier to talk up James’s passion.

“It’s part of the business,” Pochettino said. “He was upset about the situation [against Villa] and then you need to understand that he is so committed to this project from the beginning. He feels really bad because he cannot help the team [because of his injury].

“He made a mistake, we all make them and he was really sorry about it. I think he’s not going to repeat the situation. This is a young guy that wants to play football. He was frustrated and he made a mistake. That’s it. Finish.”

Pochettino made James his captain because of “his personality, his leadership, the respect he has from the club and his teammates … he has Chelsea DNA”. He described him as an appointment “for the present and the future – we cannot change captain every season, every six months”.

It is also easy to imagine that Pochettino sees something of himself in James; the self-belief, the running on the emotions of a match day. Pochettino made the point that he had got himself booked for dissent during the Burnley game. And then there is his connection with the Arsenal manager, Mikel Arteta; there are similarities, albeit this relationship is rather deeper, going back to their time together as players at Paris Saint-Germain.

There is a reason why Pochettino calls Arteta “family”. They joined PSG at the same time, early 2001; Pochettino was 28, Arteta 18. They hit it off immediately, Pochettino wowed by Arteta’s charisma and his reading of the game. “Already, he was a coach,” Pochettino said, and he has no qualms with what some perceive as Arteta’s histrionic touchline behaviour.

“It’s how you are and about your character,” Pochettino said. “He feels football. I am 51 and still sometimes I feel that decisions are no good or unfair. You are competitive. Like with Mikel or myself or other coaches that played football, in our minds, we still believe we can play. Still, we have the animal instinct. We cannot be thinkers.”

For Pochettino, it must be about channeling the emotion in the right way and not suppressing it. More broadly, he is in a better place after the wins at Fulham and Burnley, which followed the Carabao Cup victory over Brighton on the day that James was charged.

Arsenal represent an acid test of the progress and the start of a daunting run in the league; after them, Chelsea face Brentford, Tottenham, Manchester City, Newcastle, Brighton and Manchester United. Pochettino, though, pushed back against the notion that he was seeking a first statement win at the club, something to ignite his tenure. All he wants are points to drive his team up from 11th in the table.

Pochettino has appeared mired in a selection crisis since his arrival at Chelsea; James only one element of it and he will be without seven others through injury against Arsenal.

“The moment we have all the squad at a high level and fit, we can say: ‘OK, we are going to Arsenal, Manchester City and we are going to beat you.’ At the moment, with the circumstances, I don’t think this game is going to be a statement to say: ‘Be careful, Chelsea is coming,’ or something like this.”",Pochettino looks past James mistake and stakes future on his ‘Chelsea DNA’,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/oct/20/pochettino-reece-james-mistake-future-chelsea-dna-arsenal,The Guardian
sports,,2023-10-20T21:30:00+00:00,"Mauricio Pochettino and Mikel Arteta meet as head coaches for the first time on Saturday - but the Chelsea and Arsenal bosses know each other inside out. ""He's part of my family,"" says the Argentinean.

Rewind to 2001 and Arteta - just a teenager - had arrived at Paris Saint-Germain on loan from Barcelona's B side. It was his first experience in the first team of a top-flight side and he was struggling to come to terms with the transition.

Fortunately, PSG had another new recruit. Pochettino - 10 years Arteta's senior - took the Spaniard under his wing.

""It was my first professional opportunity in Paris and we arrived at the same time and lived together in a hotel for three months,"" Arteta said on Friday.

""He was critical, he has been one of the most influential people in my career, firstly as a player, he took me under the arm and looked after me like a little child, a little brother.

""He was a big part of the success I had in Paris. It was because of him because he really looked after me, gave me a lot of confidence and a lot of advice.""

Pochettino has equally fond recollections of that period and says the signs were already there that Arteta would make a successful coach in the future.

""Amazing memories. We share values and the passion for football,"" Pochettino said.

""He's part of my family from day one. We arrived in Paris together and we spent time together with our families, first of all in the hotel and then we lived very close.

""It was an amazing history. He's not surprised me with what he's doing because he was a coach already at 17!

""He was really good with how he saw football. He can be one of the greatest managers in the world.""

Image: Mikel Arteta and Mauricio Pochettino will meet for the first time as opposition managers when Arsenal go to Chelsea on Saturday

Picking out Arteta's strengths, Pochettino explained why he thinks the Gunners boss is destined for the top.

""What Arsenal are showing is because he's one of the best,"" Pochettino said. ""I don't care if he's young or not young - he's one of the best coaches in the world.

""It's not only about being good tactically - it's about how you manage people, the media, the owners, the sporting director. It's not only about being clever.""

Live: SNF

Arteta - who labelled Pochettino's early work at Chelsea as 'phenomenal' - revealed in his press conference ahead of his side's trip to Stamford Bridge that Pochettino's influence continued from those early days through his career as a player and into coaching.

""I went from playing Ligue 1 to a week later Champions League in Milan, I was all over the place,"" said Arteta. ""I didn't speak the language, it was my first professional club and I needed someone to be close to me, give me confidence, give me support, because I was thrown in there and they said 'play, you're in the starting XI'.

""So he was coaching me, talking to me. Really, really inspirational. He was really supportive. I was living with him for 2-3 months so that period was key in my career to be able to make it.

""He's an expert at giving you confidence and then keeping you on your toes all the time and being really harsh on me every time I was doing something: 'Where have you been last night?!' He really looked after me.

""The way he understood the game was phenomenal. I used to have him at my back and he was constantly coaching me. Very proud of what he has done and the way he has done it throughout his coaching career.

""I'm so grateful for what he did for me and the way he guided me in those early years. He got something else out of me that was needed in that period to make it and stayed with me in my football career as a player and coach.""

Pochettino is relishing the prospect of going head-to-head with Arteta on Saturday - although admitted there would be no favours for an old friend when the first whistle blows.

""It's going to be really nice because my love for him is there,"" said the Chelsea boss.

""He's more than a friend - he's family. It's going to be strange. But we are really competitive and you want to win. You want to destroy the opponent!""

Arteta shared a similar sentiment.

""It's great that after those years we're in this situation where you face each other and we're both managing great clubs in the best league in the world. it doesn't get better than that.

""On game day? Go for him! He is going to do the same. We are both winners.""

Friends reunited

It won't just be Pochettino and Arteta seeing familiar faces on Saturday. The derby will be the first time Kai Havertz and Jorginho have gone back to play at Stamford Bridge since leaving Chelsea for Arsenal.

""I'm sure they'll be excited,"" said Arteta. ""They were there and they talked really highly about the club. I'm sure it'll be a special day for them.""

Havertz will command particular focus after his early struggles at Arsenal. With just one goal in 12 appearances for the club there are questions about his form and role.

Armando Broja will miss Chelsea's game against Arsenal due to ""irritation"" in his knee. Late checks will be made on the fitness of Reece James, Axel Disasi and Nicolas Jackson, while Benoit Badiashile could return from a long-term injury.

Enzo Fernandez and Moises Caicedo should be available despite travelling to South America during the international break.

Ben Chilwell, Carney Chukwuemeka, Christopher Nkunku, Romeo Lavia, Wesley Fofana and Trevoh Chalobah remain unavailable.

Arsenal will make a late call on the fitness of Bukayo Saka, William Saliba and Leandro Trossard.

Saka missed the win over Man City before the international break after limping out of both the Champions League defeat at Lens and previous win over Bournemouth. He was also unavailable for England duty.

Meanwhile, Saliba was forced to withdraw from the France squad to rest a 'chronic toe injury', despite a starring role in that win over City. Trossard came off at half-time in that match and missed Belgium's games with a hamstring issue.

sports,Travis Pulver,2023-12-05T20:45:25+00:00,"NFL award longshots can be easy to overlook since each has a favorite(s). The longshot may be playing well, but other players have commanded the spotlight, making it easier for them to go unnoticed.

Whatever the reason, they have not gotten the credit they deserve. However, with five weeks left in the regular season, there is plenty of time for a longshot to become a contender.

But if you wait too long before placing a bet, your payout will be a lot less than if you were to roll the dice on a longshot right now.

Longshots to consider for NFL MVP, OPOY, DPOY, Coach of the Year and Comeback POY

There is always a reason why a player or several players have relatively short odds — they've been the best at their position throughout the season. Consequently, there is just as good a reason why longshots have odds as long as they do.

So, keep your bets small, or use a bonus bet (if you have one available), on longshots. If they do go on to win, smile all the way to the bank while you tell everyone, ""I told you so.""

RELATED: Best NFL Betting sites | How to bet on the NFL

NFL MVP

Current favorite(s): Brock Purdy , Dak Prescott , Jalen Hurts

, Dak Prescott , Jalen Hurts Longshot(s): C.J. Stroud , Jared Goff

The MVP often ends up being someone, typically the quarterback, from one of the top-seeded teams. Hence, Brock Purdy, Dak Prescott and Jalen Hurts sit atop betting boards after Week 13.

But, by that logic, Jared Goff should be in the conversation. He has played well this season — his Lions are 9-3, poised to win the NFC South and in contention for the No. 1 seed in the conference.

Compared to the 49ers, Cowboys and Eagles, Goff and the Lions may have the easiest schedule to finish the season.

But bettors should also pay attention to C.J. Stroud. He leads the league in passing yards, is one of four quarterbacks eho have started the whole season with a passer rating over 100, and his touchdown to interception ratio is the best in the NFL (4 to 1)

As for the value of his play, Stroud has taken one of the worst teams in the NFL (11 total wins the last three seasons) and turned it into a playoff contender and potential division champion.

Offensive Player of the Year

Current favorite: Tyreek Hill

Longshot: CeeDee Lamb

There's a good reason why Tyreek Hill is such a heavy favorite to win OPOY. The Dolphins wide receiver is on track to become the first player with 2,000-plus receiving yards in a single season.

But there is a solid chance he does not hit that mark. Of Miami's five remaining opponents, four have pass defenses ranked in the league's top eight. If he slows down, someone like CeeDee Lamb could catch up.

Based on his current season average, Lamb is on track for close to 1,600 yards, but based on his production over the last seven games, he could finish with closer to 1,800 yards.

He will probably need Hill to fade down the stretch to have a shot. But if Hill does and he continues to produce, Lamb could steal OPOY from Hill.

Defensive Player of the Year

Current favorite(s): Micah Parsons , Myles Garrett , and T.J. Watt

, Myles Garrett , and T.J. Watt Longshot: Danielle Hunter

Hunter leads the league in tackles for a loss and is third in sacks with 13.5 (behind Khalil Mack and Watt). Not only has he produced at a high level, but his play has been instrumental in the Vikings turning things around after a 1-4 start.

He may not have the name recognition that Parsons, Garrett and Watt have, but he has played as well, if not better, this season. If he can continue to produce, he at least deserves to be in the conversation, if not win.

Coach of the Year

Current favorite: Dan Campbell +200 (via DraftKings)

Longshot: Sean Payton +2200 (via DraftKings)

Campbell has done a tremendous job with the Lions, but it is fair to wonder if he's the betting favorite because of how well he has done his job this season or over the last two. This year, the team benefited from the groundwork laid last season.

If there were a reward for the best coach over two seasons, he would deserve it. As for this season, not so much.

Sean Payton should be at the forefront of the conversation. It's one thing to turn around a team that was dreadful last season. But he has taken one that got off to a horrible start and turned things around in-season.

Oh — and he has resurrected Russell Wilson's career.

That alone should put him at the top of the list, but he may need to get Denver into the playoffs to convince voters.

Comeback Player of the Year

Current favorite: Demar Hamlin

Longshot: Russell Wilson

Coming back from a life-threatening injury like a cardiac arrest makes Hamlin a great candidate to win CPOY. However, it would be understandable if voters were to look elsewhere since Hamlin has seldom been active on game day and rarely seen the field.

It will depend on how vital voters deem playing to be.

Wilson was supposed to be the next great franchise quarterback for the Broncos when they acquired him prior to last season. But rather than lead the team back to prominence, Wilson was terrible and so was Denver.

This season, Wilson has played well even when the Broncos have not. He is not producing mind-blowing stat lines, but he is keeping his team competitive, playing efficiently and not making many mistakes.

Until his three-interception day last week, he had the best touchdown-to-interception ratio in the league. But even with those picks, his is still second-best.","NFL awards odds: Six longshots bettors should consider for MVP, OPOY, DPOY and more",https://www.sportingnews.com/us/betting/news/nfl-awards-odds-longshots-mvp-opoy-dpoy/ed7dc8b5ba19eb3e71c53349,Sporting News
sports,Heath Cummings,2023-12-19T20:51:32+00:00,"There will be many difficult decisions to be made in Week 16. It is the Fantasy Football semifinals in most leagues and there is a certain finality to every decision. There's no shortage of things to stress over as a Fantasy manager. Whether or not you start Rashee Rice shouldn't be one of them. While Rice is just WR29 on the season, that's mostly due to a slow start, and his hot start has pushed him into must-start, borderline top-12 territory.

The Chiefs' star rookie has four straight games with at least nine targets and he's scored at least 14 PPR Fantasy points in all of those games. Since Week 12, only Deebo Samuel and CeeDee Lamb have scored more PPR Fantasy points that Rice.

On paper, the matchup doesn't look great, because the Raiders have been above average in terms of limiting the Fantasy production of wide receivers. But this hot stretch started against the Raiders, when Rice scored 24.7 PPR Fantasy points against them in Week 12. They are playing a style of defense that limits big plays but allows throws underneath which fits Rice and his 4.3 ADOT perfectly. While the Raiders have surrendered the 11th-fewest passing yards this season, they've given up the fourth-most yards after the catch.

If Rice is on your roster, he's in your starting lineup. You have plenty of other things to stress about.

sports,Dave Richard,2023-10-12T21:23:16+00:00,"Fantasy Football is all about the matchups. Even though you drafted your team with certain hopes and intentions, your weekly lineup decisions shouldn't be determined by the order you picked your players in. You need to check who your players play and make sure you've got the right guys in -- and the wrong guys out.

It's too early to be absolutely sure on which matchups will be easy and which ones will be tough, but we can take some educated guesses based on healthy personnel, defensive schemes, track records and key details of offenses. The things we know can help us minimize the impact of the things we don't know. This should lead to better decisions being made.

We'll go through every game and highlight the players who aren't obvious starts and sits (because you don't need to be told to start Justin Jefferson). You should feel more comfortable starting or sitting players based on the information given, and feeling comfortable with your Fantasy lineup before the games start is the best feeling in the world.

It's also important to have a keen eye for matchups dictated by the remaining schedule. I am now updating my projected Strength of Schedule rankings our broken down by position available on SportsLine. My objective is to break down how the schedule affects every Fantasy relevant player for the upcoming four weeks, the playoff stretch and the entire season. You'll also be able to find my key takeaways on which players you should buy low, sell high and more trade advice.

Sit Him (Lineup Decisions) Projections powered by Sportsline Jaleel McLaughlin RB DEN Denver • #38

Age: 23 • Experience: Rookie Weekly Breakdown MATCHUP @ KC KC -10.5 O/U 47 OPP VS RB 6th PROJ PTS 11.8 RB RNK 26th YTD Stats RUYDS 160 REC 7 REYDS 46 TD 3 FPTS/G 9.3 There isn't a Broncos running back you'll have much confidence in starting because they'll all split the proverbial pie too much. I'd start McLaughlin over Williams, but I would rather start Brian Robinson, Alexander Mattison, Rachaad White, Jerome Ford and Rhamondre Stevenson.

LAST WEEK: Despite splitting first-half snaps almost evenly and losing out on second-half snaps considerably, McLaughlin made three splash plays of 21, 22 and 38 yards including a touchdown on a tipped-then-secured designed screen that pierced through the middle of the Jets defense. Those three touches were his best -- his other nine touches each failed to exceed 3 yards. And as mentioned two sentences ago, he played just 10 snaps in the second half when the Broncos were trailing.

FILM: McLaughlin has good vision and speed, both of which were essential in reading the Jets defense at the first and second levels and choosing the correct paths to run on his big plays. His lateral agility was a differentiator on his touchdown catch. McLaughlin's worst asset is his power as he just won't finish runs with physicality like his backfield mates do. But the biggest detriment is that he can't consistently overcome bad blocking, which has been a consistent problem for the Denver O-line all year and certainly something that impacted Javonte Williams in his first handful of games.

WHEN TRAILING: When the Jets were up by eight or more points in the second half, McLauglhin played 4 of 15 snaps and had two carries. That's in line with a trend we've seen from Denver all year: Of the 117 snaps they've played when down by eight or more points, McLaughlin has played 26 snaps (13 touches, seven at Chicago), Williams has played 27 snaps (15 touches, almost all against Miami) and Samaje Perine has played 58 snaps (13 touches) -- more than both backs combined. The only guy who's averaged a strong number on the ground in this specific situation? You guessed it -- McLaughlin (6.1 yards per carry).

CHIEFS: Tend to build leads on their opponents. They also have given up just four rushing plays of 12-plus yards this season, and that includes a fake punt run by the Vikings last week. Kansas City has given up one rushing TD to a running back this season. Impressive numbers considering they're giving up 4.5 yards per carry and rank in the bottom-10 in yards before contact and yards after contact. The secret? Teams don't run the ball that much against them (16.4 attempts per game, fourth-fewest) because ... they tend to build leads on their opponents.

CHIEFS: David Montgomery and Alexander Mattison are the only two running backs to tally at least 10 Fantasy points (PPR or non-PPR) against Kansas City this year. Both scored.

BRONCOS: When McLaughlin, Williams and Perine were all part of the Broncos game plan in their Week 3 blowout loss, Williams had the most work (13 touches) and the most PPR points (8.5). The only time a Denver back had 15-plus touches came in Week 1 when Williams had 17 against the Raiders (and had 9.7 PPR points, a season-high).

But Tennessee's run defense has weakened a bit and the Ravens could be apt to take advantage. Of course there's upside for Flowers to haul in a couple of long targets, and that really is what keeps him in the flex conversation. But I would rather start Christian Kirk, Marquise Brown, Michael Pittman and Jakobi Meyers as WR2 options this week.

Sneaky Sleeper in PPR (Lineup Decisions) Projections powered by Sportsline Justice Hill RB BAL Baltimore • #43

Age: 26 • Experience: 5 yrs. Weekly Breakdown MATCHUP @ TEN BAL -4 O/U 41 OPP VS RB 14th PROJ PTS 7.5 RB RNK 29th YTD Stats RUYDS 115 REC 7 REYDS 25 TD 3 FPTS/G 9.3 It's a little gutsy to go with Hill, who has been inefficient for much of the year. We're counting on the Ravens outsmarting the big size of the Titans defensive line and utilizing Hill for his speed along the edges and in the passing game. His high-value touch share is the icing on the cake and hopefully can lead to him scoring just over 12 PPR points for the second week in a row. I'd take my chances with him over low-upside running backs like Gus Edwards, Antonio Gibson and Jonathan Taylor (for now he's low-upside).

LAST WEEK: I surmised that Flowers would be targeted more if the Ravens run game couldn't get going. Sure enough, it didn't, and Flowers saw a season-high 11 targets at Pittsburgh. Unfortunately, Flowers underwhelmingly caught just five balls for 73 yards with two drops that would have pushed his yardage over 100 had he held on to both targets.

AIR YARDS: Flowers was targeted downfield more last week than in any game this season with a 15.27 Average Depth of Target (ADOT). It was the first time he had a double-digit ADOT and more than six targets. He lined up wide on the majority of snaps (66.7%) and hitches were still his route of choice but there was more diversity there than before. It's also notable Flowers did this while sharing the field with Odell Beckham and Rashod Bateman back on the field.

TITANS: Run defense started the season strong but got smashed last week by Zack Moss and the Colts to the tune of 6.3 yards per carry and four explosive runs (they had allowed two total headed into the game). Moss beat a stacked box on his 56-yard TD scamper. And even when Richardson wasn't on the field the Colts averaged 4.7 yards per run against Tennessee.

TITANS PAST TWO: Against the Bengals and Colts, the Titans allowed at least 2.79 yards before contact per rush in each game and were decimated by zone-scheme runs (at least 6.0 rush yards per carry by RBs).

RAVENS RUN GAME: Have called zone runs half as many times as power runs even though they average a half-yard better per carry on zone runs. They'd be smart to do more of that this week against Tennessee. Hill has the team's best rushing average and highest rush EPA on zone runs.

HILL: In the three games he's played the most snaps in (Weeks 1, 2 and 5), he's played 24 of a possible 43 third-down snaps (56%) and 14 of 20 snaps inside the 10. He's smaller than Gus Edwards, but faster and more versatile, and it's given him extended opportunities for high-value touches.

TITANS PASS DEFENSE: Rank in the bottom-five in catch rate allowed to outside wide receivers (75.8%) but handle them well otherwise (12.5 yards per catch, 3.34 YAC/reception are both top-10). They're equally adept versus hitch routes and WR screens, Flowers' two most-run routes. Tennessee has allowed exactly 50% of pass attempts of 15-plus Air Yards to all wide receivers be completed for a bottom-five yards per catch allowed rate, but they're league average in YAC/reception and touchdowns allowed on those throws, and the numbers are a little bit better for them if you discount four hiccups in Week 1.

Sit Him (Lineup Decisions) Projections powered by Sportsline Terry McLaurin WR WAS Washington • #17

Age: 28 • Experience: 5 yrs. Weekly Breakdown MATCHUP @ ATL ATL -2.5 O/U 42.5 OPP VS WR 6th PROJ PTS 12.1 WR RNK 37th YTD Stats REC 25 TAR 31 REYDS 261 TD 1 FPTS/G 11.4 The only two games McLaurin posted good numbers in were Washington's 35-33 win over Denver in Week 2 and Washington's 34-31 OT loss to Philadelphia in Week 4. This matchup has an over/under of 42.5 points, tied for fourth-lowest of the week. Tack on the ascending secondary the Falcons seem to have and the Commanders' diffusion of targets and McLaurin is at best a low-end flex. I'd rather roll the dice on Drake London, Tyler Lockett or Garrett Wilson.

LAST WEEK: Hopeful that his target edge over his teammates would keep growing, and even in a favorable game script where the Commanders were trailing by three scores before halftime, McLaurin only saw five targets against the Bears' heavy zone coverage.

FILM: On the 10 third-down routes McLaurin ran last week, he drew extra coverage on four of them, got open on two of them (Howell threw elsewhere) and was a decoy on Curtis Samuel's touchdown. What happened? Sam Howell was getting rid of the ball quickly and to shorter distances as the Bears were getting some pressure on him. By the end of the game McLaurin's body language seemed dispirited.

COMMANDERS: Throw to their wideouts on 58.7% of their targets, which is below league average (but not as bad as, say, the Falcons at 36.4%). What makes that number worse is that McLaurin has just one more target (31) than Jahan Dotson (30), who has three more targets than Curtis Samuel (27). They're all nearly even after five games and each of them has had a turn leading in targets at least once.

FALCONS: Are expected to play a heavy dose of zone coverage, if only because the Commanders have struggled to be explosive against zone coverage this year. Atlanta also gave a full dose of snaps last week to outside cornerback Jeff Okudah, who wasn't flawless but does offer another sizable body to help against stronger perimeter receivers. Between Okudah and A.J. Terrell there isn't a matchup that's great for McLaurin.

McLAURIN: Has an impressive 91.3% catch rate versus zone coverage this year, but is averaging just 9.3 yards per catch with it on a sub-9.0 ADOT. His target share is below 20% regardless of the kind of coverage he sees.

Start Him (Lineup Decisions) Projections powered by Sportsline Logan Thomas TE WAS Washington • #82

Age: 32 • Experience: 9 yrs. Weekly Breakdown MATCHUP @ ATL ATL -2.5 O/U 42.5 OPP VS TE 31st PROJ PTS 8.4 TE RNK 11th YTD Stats REC 18 TAR 25 REYDS 183 TD 2 FPTS/G 11.6 Streaming Thomas is worth the risk considering how the Falcons have let up numbers to tight ends. The Commanders clearly value the position in their offense, Thomas sees the most throws from Howell, and if Atlanta plays heavy zone coverage then it should mean a bunch of underneath throws for Thomas to take in. You're hoping for at least seven targets here, which is possible. He's worth the nod over Jake Ferguson, Dalton Schultz and Tyler Conklin, and it's close in full PPR over Kyle Pitts.

LAST WEEK: Thomas was a big-time benefactor of the Commanders chasing points against Chicago's heavy zone coverage, seeing 10 of his 11 targets once the Bears built a 17-point lead in the first half. A 24-yard catch on the final play of the first half against prevent defense didn't hurt either.

FALCONS: See the third-most targets per game to tight ends (9.0) which in turn has made them bottom-five in raw stats like total catches and yards allowed. But they float around league average in catch rate allowed (77.8%, below league average) and yards per catch (8.9, better than league average). However, no team has allowed more first-down receptions to tight ends (17). Keep in mind, this defense hasn't seen tight ends better than Evan Engram, Sam LaPorta or Dalton Schultz.

COMMANDERS: Throw to their tight ends on 26.3% of their throws, fourth-most in football. But that hasn't always meant a huge target share for Thomas. In Weeks 1 and 5 he saw at least 22.9% of Sam Howell's targets. He left Week 2 after suffering a concussion and was absent in Week 3; then was not part of the game plan much in Week 4 (7.7% target share against Philadelphia). Perhaps it's all health related and Thomas' volume from last week will stick.

ZONE COVERAGE: Atlanta usually plays a lot of zone coverage early on and if it works they stick with it for the whole game (Week 5 was an example of that). In Weeks 3 and 4 against the Lions and Jaguars they played much more man coverage, especially when they needed a fourth-quarter turnover. And because Howell is much less explosive against zone looks, I expect the Falcons to stick with zone much more this week.

Start Him (Lineup Decisions) Projections powered by Sportsline Kyle Pitts TE ATL Atlanta • #8

Age: 23 • Experience: 3 yrs. Weekly Breakdown MATCHUP vs WAS ATL -2.5 O/U 42.5 OPP VS TE 10th PROJ PTS 10.3 TE RNK 9th YTD Stats REC 18 TAR 32 REYDS 208 TD 0 FPTS/G 7.8 If last week had been Week 1 then I would have been encouraged by Pitts' performance and would probably keep expectations high. But we've seen four really measly weeks from Pitts before Week 5, so forgive me for not rushing back to him as a must-start tight end. The truth is that the matchup is a little tougher for him and for Ridder, plus teams have beaten the Commanders on deep shots to wide receivers, not lumbering tight ends, so I'm not convinced Pitts will maintain his target share or develop more explosive plays. He's still worth trotting out there over Logan Thomas, Dallas Goedert and Cole Kmet, but keep expectations around 70 yards on six catches.

LAST WEEK: Came alive against the Texans' zone-heavy defense with season-highs in targets (11), catches (seven) and yards (87). This was his second game of his last three where his target share was over 23%. It was nice to see him as a key part of the offense, but I can't help but notice he played a season-low 53% of the snaps.

FILM: Two things helped Pitts out: One, he looked a little quicker off the snap and a little faster when running straight. He's still lumbering when he changes directions in his routes but perhaps he's slowly getting healthier. Two, Desmond Ridder seemed very comfortable throwing into tighter windows to Pitts in zone coverage as the two had some good timing down, mainly on dig and out-breaking routes.

PITTS: Continues to harvest a high ADOT -- last week it was 11.36 yards and on the season it's 11.72, the highest among all qualifying tight ends. He also has the lowest catch rate (56.3%) and worst YAC/reception average (1.33 yards) among all qualifying tight ends. Of his 208 yards, just 24 have come after the catch.

COMMANDERS: Play zone coverage at a slightly lower-than-league-average rate, typically turning to man coverage as soon as games get sideways (like in the second quarter last week or the fourth quarter against the Bills). Opponents average 32.0 pass attempts per game against them, ninth-fewest in football, and against tight ends that line up in the slot or out wide like Pitts, the Commanders rank among the top-five in yards per catch, YAC/reception and have yet to allow a reception of 20-plus yards.

DEEP PASSES: The Commanders have allowed the seventh-most receptions of throws that traveled 15-plus Air Yards this season with 19. Of those 19, only two were caught by tight ends (Cole Kmet, Dallas Goedert) and neither went for more than 23 yards.

Sit Him (Lineup Decisions) Projections powered by Sportsline K.J. Osborn WR MIN Minnesota • #17

Age: 26 • Experience: 4 yrs. Weekly Breakdown MATCHUP @ CHI MIN -2.5 O/U 44.5 OPP VS WR 20th PROJ PTS 10.7 WR RNK 33rd YTD Stats REC 13 TAR 26 REYDS 166 TD 2 FPTS/G 8.3 No doubt there's some potential here, but some hunches keep me from falling for Osborn this week. One: I think the Vikings will try to get their run game going since they don't have Justin Jefferson. Two: Jordan Addison is far more explosive and T.J. Hockenson has been a much more relied-upon weapon. They should have more targets than Osborn. And the expected zone coverage Chicago will play further will limit Osborn unless he sees more targets than expected. He has more upside than Jerry Jeudy, Jahan Dotson and Tutu Atwell but I'd rather take a shot on Drake London, Terry McLaurin or Chris Godwin.

LAST WEEK: Over 19 snaps without Justin Jefferson last week, Osborn ran 18 routes and caught both of his two targets for 30 total yards. The receiving average was delightful, but the small-sample target share (12.5%) was saddening. What's funny is that Osborn's target share was much higher when Jefferson was playing (23.3%) but his receiving average tanked (6.3).

FILM: Osborn didn't beat coverage with his speed last week and his burst and agility were just OK. His 22-yard catch came on a Kirk Cousins scramble where he waited in a spot and Cousins hit him, then Osborn ran inside instead of outside where he might have been able to score. He also ducked under an end-zone target instead of leaping for it. It's worth noting that a 36-yard crosser he ran against the Chargers flies in the face of this as he separated from man coverage with speed and technique, then turned upfield and ran outside before racing past a defender and diving for the pylon.

OSBORN: Has a 50% catch rate on the year and that includes whether he faces zone coverage or man coverage. He sees more targets per route run against man coverage and averages more yards per catch and yards after catch against man coverage. Over his career, targets do seem to come more frequently against man coverage and he has been more explosive with them.

BEARS: Play zone coverage at the fourth-highest rate of any defense this season (79.2%). And because Cousins is much more explosive of a passer against man coverage, expect Chicago to keep up their zone defense.

HISTORY: In 20 career games with at least five targets, Osborn has scored at least 12 PPR points in 13 of them. Eleven of those 13 involved him catching a touchdown. Osborn has two career games with over 100 yards -- and one came last January at Chicago.

Start Him (Lineup Decisions) Projections powered by Sportsline Cole Kmet TE CHI Chicago • #85

Age: 24 • Experience: 4 yrs. If you start Kmet, you're buying into his role as Fields' change-up to D.J. Moore -- and in the case of this week, a change-up to the Bears' depleted run game. I especially like his red-zone role and his touchdown opportunities. I'm ready to chance it with Kmet over Kyle Pitts, George Kittle and Dallas Goedert.

LAST WEEK: Kmet kept rolling as Justin Fields' second-favorite target, turning five throws into a 5-42-1 stat line versus a Commanders defense that had shut down the Cardinals, Bills and Eagles tight ends to start the season.

PAST TWO GAMES: Really since the Bears told Chase Claypool to take a hike, Kmet has become a focal point of the offense. He's averaged seven targets per game with a 24.6% target share to go along with four red-zome targets and three end-zone targets. He's second to D.J. Moore in all of those categories except red-zone targets, where he's first -- and by a lot (no one else has more than one, including Moore).

BEARS: May need Kmet as a short-area target to help make up for some of the run game as the Bears are expected to not only be without Khalil Herbert but also rookie Roschon Johnson. In an effort not to overwork their backs, who won't have it easy against the Vikings, Kmet could handle more short-area throws than normal. His ADOT over the past two games has been 7.64, which isn't far from his season average of 6.69.

VIKINGS: Allow the fewest yards per catch to rival tigh ends (5.9 yards), even keeping a lid on Travis Kelce last week (6.7 yards per catch). But they've also seen the fourth-lowest ADOT from tight ends (5.0 yards per target), almost as if teams know they won't be able to succeed on downfield shots against them (zero completions of 20-plus yards from tight ends). These numbers are tough but if Kmet gets the target volume we've seen him have over the past couple of weeks he can still put up palatable numbers. And, tight ends have scored three times in the Vikings past three games.

Flex Starter (Lineup Decisions) Projections powered by Sportsline Tyler Lockett WR SEA Seattle • #16

Age: 31 • Experience: 9 yrs. Weekly Breakdown MATCHUP @ CIN CIN -2.5 O/U 45 OPP VS WR 11th PROJ PTS 11.9 WR RNK 36th YTD Stats REC 17 TAR 27 REYDS 157 TD 2 FPTS/G 11.7 If you start Lockett, you're doing it for his upside and on the hope that Smith can have a minor resurgence against man coverage. It may also come to pass that the Seahawks are trailing in the game and thus have to throw. Consider Lockett more of a top-30 receiver who you should sit for Zay Flowers and Gabe Davis but start over Chris Godwin, Nico Collins, Garrett Wilson and Drake London.

BENGALS: Consistently tailor their defensive coverage to the weaknesses of the offenses they face. So when a quarterback struggles against zone coverage, they'll play more zone. This worked in their favor in all but one game this year (Ravens, Week 2). Cincinnati also has turned on the juice for their pass rush, getting a pressure rate of over 40% in each of their past three games, all versus teams with suspect offensive lines.

BENGALS: Are expected to be without top cornerback Chidobe Awuzie, and they also are rotating one of their safety spots between Nick Scott and Jordan Battle. D.J. Turner is expected to replace Awuzie.

GENO SMITH: Has a 47.8% completion rate and a lowly 4.1 yards per attempt average against man coverage so far this season. He's also barely thrown deep (4.3% of his attempts went 20-plus Air Yards). A huge reason for the low numbers is because his pass protection has been dreadful. The anticipated return of left tackle Charles Cross should help him have more time, which in turn helps his receivers.

OUTSIDE WRs: Have caught just 50% of their targets against the Bengals this season, third-lowest in football. However, when those receivers have caught the ball they've averaged 17.9 yards per catch, which is the third-most in the league. The Bengals defense has really only let up big games to receivers who catch touchdowns.

LOCKETT: Already the team leader in target share for the season, Lockett sees more targets on a route-run basis against man coverage (28%) compared to zone (21%). He also does better with them, averaging a full 2.0 more yards per catch and with a much higher explosive play rate (14.3% compared to 5.0% against zone).

Sneaky Sleeper (Lineup Decisions) Projections powered by Sportsline Jeff Wilson RB MIA Miami • #23

Weekly Breakdown MATCHUP vs CAR MIA -13.5 O/U 48.5 OPP VS RB 31st PROJ PTS 7 RB RNK NR YTD Stats RUYDS 0 REC 0 REYDS 0 TD 0 FPTS/G 0 Once it's clear that Wilson will play, the matchup combined with the Dolphins' approach to utilize multiple backs should put Wilson in position to have some good opportunities. Remember, Wilson's injury was to his abdomen, not his legs, so there might not be much of a limit on how much work he'll do (though it's unlikely he'll have a ton of touches). I'd take my chances with him over Samaje Perine, Jerick McKinnon and Antonio Gibson.

WILSON: Started practicing this week after being sidelined with finger and abdomen injuries since late August. He and his fresh legs are back just in time as rookie sensation De'Von Achane hit Injured Reserve this week with a knee injury.

DOLPHINS: Aren't quite the bastion of rushing that some headlines have made them out to be, but they're just over league average in rush rate at 43.7% and above league average in RB runs per game at 22.6. All of these numbers are weighted heavily by their 50-point win over Denver in Week 3 when they ran the ball 42 times with their running backs. Their 7.6 yard per carry average is due to Achane's breakout start more than anything else.

McDANIEL: Prefers to use two running backs from game to game, and in Miami's past three games there's been a relatively close split in carries between two backs (18 and 13 in Week 3, 8 and 7 in Week 4, 11 and 10 in Week 5).

LAST YEAR: Wilson was efficient in his eight games in Miami, averaging 4.7 yards per carry with three touchdowns and just over 60 total yards per matchup. That includes two games he barely played in (under 20 snaps) -- take those out and he averaged 78.2 total yards per game.

SALVON AHMED? Was a healthy scratch last week and figures to be no better than a special-teams player this week. In fact, in the seven games Raheem Mostert, Wilson and Ahmed were all active for with the Dolphins last year, Ahmed played 18 offensive snaps and 25 special-teams snaps. Wilson played 213 offensive snaps and 10 special-teams snaps.

PANTHERS: Rank in the bottom five against running backs in rush yards per carry allowed (5.2), rushing touchdowns allowed (right), explosive run rate allowed (9.8%), yards before contact per rush allowed (2.26). Every running back with at least 10 carries against the Panthers this season has posted at least nine non-PPR points. There's been one every game, but multiple running backs have had 10-plus non-PPR points in two games through five weeks.

It's purely a hunch but because Taylor is still ramping up and it takes as many as four weeks to ""get right,"" Moss should lead the way and could see as many as 15 touches. I'd start Moss as an RB2 over Rhamondre Stevenson, Emari Demercado and Taylor.

I'd view Taylor as at best a bye-week replacement with an eye on his Week 9 matchup at Carolina as his breakout game.

LAST WEEK: The Colts eased Jonathan Taylor back into action after sitting out the first four games and barely practicing at all. He played just 16% of the snaps to Zack Moss' 80%, and Moss handled nearly every third down, fourth down and snap inside the 10-yard line. Of note, Taylor played just three second-half snaps.

FILM: Taylor looked as big and strong as I remember, and he wasn't shy about contact at all. I liked how he fought for yardage on pretty much every carry. He did seem rusty when it came to processing his blocking and figuring out where to run -- it felt more like he ran up the backs of his linemen more than scan for space to make cuts and elude defenders. It was a good first step.

FILM: Moss, meanwhile, had consistently great vision and used his combination of speed and power to crash through the Titans' front, especially when they stacked the box against him on his 56-yard touchdown run. There's nothing to suggest Moss is struggling, which means his playing time doesn't figure to dwindle.

THIS WEEK: Colts coach Shane Steichen said he's ramping up Taylor's workload in practice, and the official team website believes Taylor's snap share will increase both this week and as the season goes on. But Moss still figures to be the lead back and handle a majority of high-value touches.

JAGUARS: Last week's showing against a Bills run defense that was disinterested in running the ball helped push their run defense numbers to new heights. On the season they've given up one touchdown on the ground, 3.6 yards per carry, a 6.0% explosive run rate and 2.27 yards after contact per rush to running backs. Only the explosive run rate doesn't register among the top-six across the league.

It also helps the cause that the Jaguars aren't exactly terrible against the run (3.6 yards per carry allowed), meaning that the Colts can't easily dominate on the ground for four quarters. He's best as a low-end WR2 in PPR leagues but no better than a flex in half- and non-PPR. For example, I'd start Zay Flowers, Tyler Lockett and Amari Cooper over Pittman in non-PPR, but not in PPR.

WEEK 1: Came alive in the second half against the Jaguars and finished with a season-high 97 yards on eight catches with a well-documented 39-yard catch-and-run for a touchdown.

SINCE WEEK 1: Has been above 14 PPR points once (Week 3 at Baltimore, a game Gardner Minshew started). Over the past two weeks Pittman has totaled just 12 targets against the Rams and Titans for six catches and 67 yards. It's a far cry from Week 1.

MINSHEW: Clearly more of a developed downfield thrower than Anthony Richardson and has thrown at Pittman on 26.4% of his routes run including four red-zone targets and an end-zone target. Even last week when Minshew played less than a half Pittman saw a target once every five routes he ran with Minshew.

JAGUARS: Rank fifth with a 77.7% zone coverage rate, and they've consistently played a lot of zone in every game. They were also busted up by outside receivers (over 17.0 yards per catch) last week against Buffalo and two weeks ago against the Texans. Pittman tends to play outside more than in the slot. Finally, an outside receiver has scored at least once against the Jags in every game this season, including Pittman back in Week 1.

PITTMAN: Tends to do better against zone coverage than man, though he was much better last year than this year. This year he's actually been about even in catch rate and yards per catch against man and zone coverage but does have a higher explosive play rate against zone (9.7% compared to 6.7% against man). That tracks back to last year, by the way -- his explosive play rate was nearly twice as high against zone than man.

Flex Starter In PPR (Lineup Decisions) Projections powered by Sportsline Nico Collins WR HOU Houston • #12

Age: 24 • Experience: 3 yrs. Weekly Breakdown MATCHUP vs NO NO -1.5 O/U 42.5 OPP VS WR 14th PROJ PTS 12.8 WR RNK 23rd YTD Stats REC 25 TAR 36 REYDS 467 TD 3 FPTS/G 17.9 I'm not sure the Saints will back off of their aggressive man-to-man coverage even if Stroud's stats suggest they should, and that could open the door for Collins to pick up some targets. Unfortunately, neither of his matchups are particularly favorable. I could see Collins getting a lot of short targets and for that reason alone I'd be OK starting him as a flex option in PPR ahead of Tyler Lockett and Chris Godwin, but behind Jakobi Meyers, Jaylen Waddle and Gabe Davis.

LAST WEEK: Even in a game where the Texans lost Tank Dell to a concussion before the half, Collins couldn't get much going. That included in the second half when he saw one target and couldn't catch it. He definitely wasn't shadowed by anyone and was almost never double-teamed, though there were a couple of routes where a safety was in proximity. It could have had more to do with the Texans attacking the middle of the field against the Falcons' zone coverage.

SAINTS: Have played the fifth-fewest snaps of zone coverage this season and have ignored tendencies some quarterbacks have had through the early portion of the season. It's just what they like to do. Stud cornerback Marshon Lattimore has not followed receivers much this season, playing 87% of his snaps at right cornerback (to the left of the quarterback). Their other primary outside corner, Paulson Adebo, has allowed a 50% catch rate on the season with minimal YAC.

COLLINS: It's minor but Collins does see a higher target per route run rate against man coverage (25%) than zone (22.2%). He also has a higher catch rate (87.5%) and higher receiving average (23.3) against man than zone (65.4% and 17.8). However, he's run nearly four times as many routes against zone coverage compared to man.

MATCHUPS: It's also worth pointing out that Collins' two really big games came in Week 2 (vs. Indianapolis) and Week 4 (vs. Pittsburgh), both teams that rank in the bottom-10 in Fantasy points allowed to wide receivers. The Saints are in the top half.

STROUD: Has been outstanding against man coverage all year, completing a higher rate of passes (67.6%) for 3.5 more yards per attempt (11.1) than versus zone (7.6). However, he is nowhere near as impressive when he's pressured, completing 48.1% of his throws for a weak 4.3 yards per attempt.

The Cowboys wound up paying the price through the air for playing a ton of zone coverage instead. It was suggested by a friend that they didn't want to get burned by long runs by Christian McCaffrey. I guess that worked. The combination of the 49ers defense running hot and the Browns offense figuring to get stuffed should make for at least a game script for Purdy to have decent numbers. I'm not making the mistake again of benching Purdy -- I'd start him over Trevor Lawrence, Geno Smith and Jared Goff.

LAST WEEK: Took on one of the toughest pass rushes in football and slayed them for four touchdowns on just 24 pass attempts. Of his seven incompletions, one was dropped, two were batted at the line of scrimmage, another was a throwaway and two more were defensed. Purdy was off-target on 0.0% of his throws.

FANTASY: Has hit at least 20 Fantasy points in 9 of his 10 regular-season starts, and it really should be 10 for 10 because of a touchdown that was ruled a lateral back in Week 2. If you include the two playoff games he completed, Purdy has delivered at least 20 in 10 of 12 games. And in six of those 10 he hit at least 23 Fantasy points including each of his past three games.

BROWNS: Have played the least amount of zone coverage snaps of any team in football this season, and they've done it consistently. There isn't a game this season where they've played even 65% of zone coverage snaps, and there have been only three quarters when they've called more than 70% of their snaps in zone coverage. Plus the Browns just saw the Cowboys play 90% of their snaps in zone coverage and Purdy cooked them like BBQ chicken.

PURDY: Has been sensational against both man and zone coverages this season. His completion rate and yards per attempt are noticeably higher against zone, but five of his seven passing touchdowns have come versus man coverage. However, Purdy's been at his worst when pressured (like most quarterbacks), completing 50% of his throws for 6.7 yards per attempt with a gaudy 15.9% off-target rate. These stats are actually better than they were last week.

BROWNS: Rank third in pass rush pressure rate at 41.5% and blitz at an above-average 29.3% rate. Granted, the Cowboys ranked higher than that last week and got beat anyway.

LAMAR JACKSON: Faced the Browns in their last game, saw a ton of man coverage and was pressured a bunch and he still threw two touchdowns and completed 79% of his throws for 9.8 yards per attempt. And he did it without his starting left tackle and two of his top receivers. His defense turning over an ill-prepared Browns offense helped a bunch.

In PPR you can hope for another game with five catches, which honestly isn't a stretch since he just had one against a good defense two games ago. Maybe he's good enough to start as an end-of-the-barrel RB2, but I'd feel better going with Rachaad White, Alexander Mattison or D'Onta Foreman.

SINCE CHUBB GOT HURT: Ford has averaged 4.3 yards per rush and 7.7 yards per catch with three total touchdowns (including the catch he had on the play after the Chubb injury). His 69-yard cross-field run at Pittsburgh has certainly helped his numbers out; without it he has zero touches of 20-plus yards and his only run for more than 10 yards came with a holding penalty.

SNAPS: Ford has yet to dominate snaps at running back for the Browns, playing right around 60% in Weeks 3 and 4. In fact, Ford does not have more than 14 touches in a single game since taking over for Chubb, but it's been just two games.

HERE COME THE 49ERS: On the year they've held enemy running backs to 3.7 yards per carry with an explosive run rate of 1.7% (which somehow is only second-best in football). The only rush defense metrics they're not top-five in are Defensive Rush EPA (just below league average), yards before contact per rush (0.88 yards, they're sixth), yards after contact per rush (2.80, just above league average). They even lead the NFL in fewest missed tackles. Tony Pollard had an 8-29-0 rushing stat line against them last week.

WHAT ABOUT THROUGH THE AIR? Even though the 49ers see the fifth-most RB targets per game, they're better than league average in catch rate allowed (75%) and top-10 in both yards per catch (5.7) and YAC/reception (6.10) allowed to running backs. Pollard caught 4 of 5 passes for 35 yards last week.

P.J. WALKER: Has thrown 17.2% of his career pass attempts to running backs. For 2023, the NFL league average of QB throws to running backs is 18.2%, so he's just below the current league average.

Sit Him (Lineup Decisions) Projections powered by Sportsline Amari Cooper WR CLE Cleveland • #2

Age: 29 • Experience: 9 yrs. If you start Cooper, you should not only have lower expectations but basically pray to the Fantasy Gods for some garbage production or ludicrous target volume. It's hard to trust Cooper to come through for a reliable stat line, and there's a lot of downside for a single-digit-point week. He's at best a low-end No. 3 receiver; I'd rather start Tyler Lockett, Chris Godwin or Drake London.

LAST GAME: With rookie Dorian Thompson-Robinson at quarterback, Cooper saw six targets and caught one for 16 yards. Half of the six targets were uncatchable. In his previous three with Deshaun Watson he had at least seven targets in each, and at least 16 PPR points in the past two.

SINCE THEN: Watson hasn't practiced with the team. P.J. Walker was named the starter despite being on the team's practice squad and took reps this week in preparation for their game against the Niners.

WALKER: Was cut by the Bears after the preseason before linking up with Cleveland. Has five career passing touchdowns in 15 games (seven starts). He's had multiple passing scores in one NFL game. Only twice has a receiver had 100 yards from Walker (both by D.J. Moore, once in 2020, once in 2022). Two other times has a WR had at least 70 yards (Curtis Samuel in 2020, Terrace Marshall in 2022). In his NFL career, Walker has thrown specifically to wide receivers on 71.2% of his throws, which basically the only good thing you can take away from this paragraph.

COOPER: In effectively 30 career games without Dak Prescott, Derek Carr or Deshaun Watson on the field (meaning he played with a backup), Cooper has 13 touchdowns (seven from Brissett) and seven with 100-plus yards (four with Brissett). More importantly, Cooper had at least 15 PPR points in 13 of the 30 games (six with Brissett), so 43% of the time.

BRISSETT VS WALKER: Comparing their play over the past four seasons, Brissett had a considerably higher completion rate (63% to 57.5%) with a lower interception rate (1.7% to 4.8%) and lower off-target rate (10.3% to 18.9%). Brissett didn't throw downfield as much as Walker, contributing to a higher ADOT for Walker, but not by much (8.8 to 8.3). Both quarterbacks were right around 6.5 yards per pass attempt.

49ERS: Oh yeah, the matchup isn't great. No team allows fewer yards per catch to wideouts than the Niners (9.7), and they're thrown at a ton by offenses that have to play from behind. Only three receivers -- Puka Nacua (20 targets), Marquise Brown (10 targets) and Michael Wilson (two touchdowns) have had more than 15 PPR points against them. And only one other receiver -- Tutu Atwell (nine target) -- had more than 12 PPR points.

Some might say dumping Elliott and giving more work to Stevenson would make sense, but Elliott actually has a higher rushing average and better before/after contact rates than Stevenson does! Maybe the Patriots will turn to another running back in hopes of finding anything that can help take pressure off of their depleted passing game. I can't recommend Stevenson as a start until we see proof of him playing well -- a favorable road matchup alone isn't enough. I'd rather start Jerome Ford, Zack Moss and D'Onta Foreman.

LAST WEEK: Was the first time Stevenson did not have 16 or more touches in a game. He had eight carries and no receptions. He also played a season-low 50% of the snaps but did handle 10 of 16 snaps on third/fourth downs. Stevenson started and played the first two series, then Elliott started off the next two series, but they rotated in and out for each other the whole game. Elliott continued to be the Patriots RB of choice in the two-minute offense to end the first half.

STEVENSON: Nothing has changed in terms of his efficiency. We can blame the offensive line to some degree but Stevenson has averaged 0.97 yards before contact per rush this season. That ranks 30th out of 41 qualifying running backs. And if you think that's bad then consider his yards after contact per rush average of 1.79, which is dead last among those same 41 qualifiers.

EXPLOSIVE RUNS: Stevenson has one (1) explosive carry of 12 or more yards. It was against Miami. It went 12 yards. This is a big change from 2022 when he had 21 explosive runs and an explosive run rate of 10%, which was eighth-best.

RECEIVING: Is averaging 3.6 targets per game and catching 67% of them but is getting just 7.3 yards per catch and has one (1) explosive catch of 16 or more yards. That one went for 32 yards against the Eagles in Week 1. Since then his longest reception has been for seven yards.

PATRIOTS: Have run one (1) play inside the opponents' five-yard line this entire season. That should help explain the lack of touchdowns for Stevenson.

RAIDERS: Rank in the bottom 10 versus RBs in yards per carry allowed (4.3) and yards after contact per rush allowed (3.04). But they're also in the top-10 in most rush attempts by RBs faced (24.4 per game) and they've given up just three rushing touchdowns and an explosive run on 4.9% of their snaps (that's actually 10th best). And would you believe only one running back has scored more than 15 PPR points against the Raiders this season? It's James Cook.

Think of Demercado as a candidate for 10 PPR points and perhaps four non-PPR points. I'd rather start both Colts RBs, Javonte Williams and Chuba Hubbard if Miles Sanders is out.

LAST WEEK: After James Conner left with an injury, Demercado played 100% of the Cardinals snaps. They could have used veteran RB Corey Clement to help him out but kept him on special-teams duty. And Demercado actually played fairly well, flashing solid speed and physicality on his runs with some patience blended in. He's not as big as Conner but he played kind of like him.

THIS WEEK: Arizona released a depth chart with second-year back Keaontay Ingram as the first stringer. It is expected that Ingram will work with Demercado in the Cardinals backfield this week.

INGRAM: Through 15 regular-season games over two years, Ingram has averaged 1.9 rush yards per carry. His career-long run is 13 yards. This past preseason Ingram did rock for 4.4 yards per run but no carry went more than 11 yards. His 2022 preseason wasn't better than his 2023 preseason.

THIRD DOWNS: Demercado has worked as the Cardinals third-down guy since Week 2, playing 74% of those snaps. He's also had some reps in their two-minute offense. It's not a stretch to say he's been Arizona's passing downs RB. That should remain as part of his role moving forward. But honestly, unless Ingram gets a hot hand early, Demercado should be given a chance to work running downs too.

RAMS: Have taken a step forward as a decent run defense. In their past three games, they're holding running backs to 3.6 yards per carry and are better than league average in yards before and after contact as well as in missed tackles. A rival running back has 13-plus PPR points in three of their past four games, but each of those backs had at least 20 touches. No one looks like even a 12-touch back for the Cardinals.

But the Buccaneers defense deserves some credit for holding up against their opponents. Plus, Goff's two big games came against bad secondaries and suspect pass rushes. This one is a little tougher. I think Goff is good enough to start ahead of Trevor Lawrence, Sam Howell and Geno Smith, but I would put Matthew Stafford and Brock Purdy ahead of him.

LAST WEEK: Even without two of his most explosive targets, Goff exploited the Panthers defense for 236 yards and four total touchdowns on 28 pass attempts. And in the one specific area where you might have thought David Montgomery would have gotten the ball -- inside the 5 -- Goff threw two of his scores and dove for another.

BUCCANEERS: Have been zone-heavy in three games but went man-to-man in an attempt to get back into their game against the Eagles in Week 3 and couldn't help their cause. That's their only loss on the season. The Bucs also blitz at the third-highest rate in football (41%) but even so they don't get a ton of pass rush pressure on the quarterback.

GOFF: Has proven to be a little bit better against man coverage than zone this season, but his stats against both coverages are just fine (his QB rating against both are over 105 each). He has a better TD rate and attacks downfield a little more when he sees zone coverage. As for when he's blitzed, Goff's completion rate is sensational either way (over 68%) but naturally he has better numbers when he is not blitzed. The difference is noticeable but not detrimental.

ROAD WOES: I have to bring it up even though I don't like bringing it up -- since arriving in Detroit, Goff has topped 20 Fantasy points (six points per passing touchdown) twice in 16 road games.

BUCCANEERS: Only one quarterback, Jalen Hurts, has posted over 20 Fantasy points this season on the Bucs. And only one quarterback, Kirk Cousins (on 44 attempts) threw two touchdowns against them.

If the game were in Detroit I wouldn't hesitate to call Goff a must-start. But the Buccaneers defense deserves some credit for holding up against their opponents. Plus, Goff's two big games came against bad secondaries and suspect pass rushes. This one is a little tougher.

If he couldn't put up a monster game against the Broncos, it's a tough sell that he'll do so against the Eagles. I do think volume will be in his favor, so counting on him for close to 16 PPR points (half that in non-PPR) is fair. That gives him flex appeal over Nico Collins and Tyler Lockett, but not over Jakobi Meyers, Zay Flowers or Gabe Davis.

LAST WEEK: Coming off the heels of what felt like a step in the right direction, Wilson couldn't take advantage of a favorable matchup against the Broncos. He led the Jets in targets (seven) but was second behind Tyler Conklin in catches and yards. Wilson's 26.9% target share was a season low. Getting shadowed by Patrick Surtain on all but one of his targets didn't help, nor did having a pass bounce off his hands within five yards of the end zone.

ZACH WILSON: Was off-target on 15.4% of his throws for the second consecutive week even though he had a higher completion rate (73.1%) and passing yard average (7.7 yards per attempt). It's a byproduct of Wilson attempting just 26 throws after putting the ball up 39 times the game before.

UNCATCHABLE: Of the 43 targets Garrett Wilson has seen from Zach Wilson, 14 of them (33%) have been uncatchable.

EAGLES: Have let up a slew of receiving numbers by virtue of seeing so many passes thrown against them (27.4 targets per game just to wide receivers). So naturally they rank in the bottom five in catches allowed, YAC allowed and touchdowns allowed. But on per-target metrics they're doing all right. A 60.6% completion rate allowed is 10th-best, 11.4 yards per catch allowed is seventh-best and 4.06 YAC/reception is on par with the league average.

PASS RUSH: As overworked as the Eagles secondary has been, their pass rush has been solid. Against soft O-lines in Washington and L.A., the Eagles have put pressure on at a rate of 37.6% and have blitzed 33.3% of snaps. Given the state of the Jets offensive line after losing guard Alijah Vera-Tucker to a season-ending injury, it wouldn't be a surprise if the Eagles were to spook Zach Wilson frequently, leading to shorter throws, off-target throws and sacks.

LET'S DO MATH: If the Jets are forced to throw much more than they did last week, say it's 39 times, then roughly 30% of those targets will go to Garrett Wilson. That's 12 targets. That's great. But of those 12, one-third figure to be uncatchable, meaning that we're looking at eight receptions at best for Wilson. And even though Wilson is averaging 8.7 yards per catch on the season, he deserves the benefit of at least 10.0 yards per catch since the Eagles are allowing 11.4 yards per catch to receivers. So maybe he can deliver just past 15 PPR points. Not too shabby.

That includes the Bills, who could easily drape a second defender near him to force the Giants quarterback (whoever it is) to throw elsewhere. Waller is a low-end starter in the same range as Kyle Pitts and Cole Kmet -- and only ahead of them because of the volume we're hoping he gets.

LAST WEEK: Waller was a focal point of the Giants offense and caught 8 of 11 targets for 86 yards at Miami. Four of the targets came from Tyrod Taylor (for 3-31-0), all in the fourth quarter. That was a 33% target share just from Taylor. And Waller could have had a bigger game as he was close to corralling some deep targets from Daniel Jones.

TAYLOR: Has a career target rate of 22.4% to his tight ends, which is real nice. As recently as 2020 he leaned on Hunter Henry while with the Chargers, and even in two of his hey-day years with the Bills did he work tightly with Charles Clay. He shouldn't be a detriment.

THIS SEASON: Waller has the highest target share on the G-Men, but it's 20.8%. His ADOT also sits at 8.9, and both that number and the target share got lifted up by the Giants' decision to force-feed targets to Waller last week. He also ran more downfield routes than we're used to seeing. If the Giants stick with this then Waller can meet some of his lofty expectations. But I think if Brian Daboll had it his way he'd try to find explosive plays from all of his receivers and spread the ball around.

BILLS: Got their first test against tight ends last week in Evan Engram and swarmed him -- he caught 4 of 8 targets for 28 yards. He is used similarly to Waller, which makes Buffalo's game plan for slowing Waller down easy to carry over this week. Their pass rush should also impact the Giants passing game and may force Waller to run shorter routes so he gets open quicker.

The Cowboys might pivot to a slower approach with Tony Pollard handling the run game more than he has been over the past couple of games. That could take pressure off of Prescott, but it doesn't mean he'll unload statistically. I'd rather start Sam Howell, Jared Goff and Matthew Stafford.

LAST WEEK: A nightmare scenario as Prescott tried to get aggressive on downfield throws early and missed until he hit KaVontae Turpin for a 26-yard touchdown. Then Prescott HAD to throw deep to try and climb back into the game and got sloppy on two of his interceptions (a third bounced off of Michael Gallup's hands). He didn't even play the last 12 minutes of the game and the Cowboys got blown out.

THIS SEASON: Prescott's completion rate is fine (69.4%) and his off-target rate is low (8.1%). So what's the problem? Prescott's ADOT is 6.5, ranking 28th among 33 qualifying quarterbacks. He's actually second-to-last in pass attempts of 10-plus Air Yards; only Daniel Jones has thrown fewer. And the scary part is that his ADOT was over a yard lower (5.4) going into last week's game, so the Cowboys tried to let him air it out and the plan completely backfired.

O-LINE: It's possible that injuries that go as far back as to Week 2 along with some declining play from Tyler Biadasz and Terence Steele could be contributing factors for Prescott's low ADOT. He doesn't want to get hit, so he's getting the ball out as fast as he can. Even against the 49ers he sped up his motion and overshot those targets. He's just not as comfortable and the offense isn't adjusting well enough.

CHARGERS: Traditionally play a good amount of zone coverage but have changed it up more often this season and used more man-to-man, including versus Miami in Week 1. But despite some headliners in the front seven and 16 sacks in their past three games, the Chargers rank fourth-worst in pass rush pressure rate at 29.5% this season. They also blitz at about the league average rate. In theory this should not be a difficult matchup for Prescott, but

KELLEN MOORE: Prescott's QB coach and/or playcaller for the prior five seasons will be coaching the Chargers offense on Sunday, but he's sure to have spilled the beans on Prescott's tendencies. We've seen offensive coordinators come back to wreck their old teams all the time and could see it again on Sunday.

sports,Associated Press,2023-12-03T22:11:26+00:00,"Brock Purdy threw for 314 yards and four touchdowns, Deebo Samuel scored three TDs and Eagles quarterback Jalen Hurts was checked for a concussion in the San Francisco 49ers’ 42-19 win over Philadelphia on Sunday.

The fiery NFC championship game rematch also featured 49ers’ touchdowns on six straight possessions and a pair of ejections that showed this year’s title game may not run again through Philly, after all.

49ers' Dre Greenlaw has been disqualified from tonight's game after this incident on the Eagles sideline. pic.twitter.com/2N4W17N8u9 — FOX Sports: NFL (@NFLonFOX) December 3, 2023

The 49ers (9-3) left Philly 10 months ago battered in the NFC championship game behind injuries to Purdy and his backup, and they never stood a chance in a 31-7 loss. The 49ers spent an offseason chirping at the Birds – Samuel called one Eagles cornerback “trash” – and then entered the Linc as a rare betting favorite against a 10-win team at home.

The Eagles (10-2) suffered a scare when Hurts jogged off the field in the fourth and went straight to the locker room. He was cleared to play and returned to action with about 10 minutes left. It was not immediately clear when Hurts was injured.

By the time last season’s NFL MVP runner-up returned, the Eagles trailed 35-13 and were on their way toward their first home loss of the season. Hurts did hit DeVonta Smith for a two-yard TD on his return drive. He finished 26-of-45 passing for 298 yards. Purdy put the finishing touches on the win with a 46-yard TD to Samuel.

Perhaps all that braggadocio paid off for the 49ers. Hard feelings spilled into the game, highlighted by a scrap in the third quarter that got 49ers linebacker Dre Greenlaw and the the Eagles’ chief security officer tossed.

Dom DiSandro, a constant presence on the Eagles’ sideline, pulled Greenlaw off Smith after a reception. Greenlaw popped up and reached over two officials to touch DiSandro’s face with a closed fist. Greenlaw was ejected. DiSandro, a cult hero in Philly for his ever-present backup when Eagles are out in public, also was told to leave and walked to the locker room to a roaring ovation.

Los Angeles Chargers 6-0 New England Patriots

Justin Herbert threw for 212 yards and set up a pair of Cameron Dicker field goals that were all the Los Angeles Chargers (5-7) needed for their first shutout in six years. Keenan Allen came back from a thigh injury to catch five passes for 58 yards. But the only scoring the Chargers could manage was a pair of 38-yard field goals in the second quarter. New England made a quarterback switch, benching Mac Jones in favor of Bailey Zappe. But the Patriots (2-10) still lost their fifth straight game. For the first time in franchise history, the Patriots have been shut out at home twice in a season. Zappe was sacked five times – two by Khalil Mack, giving him a career-high 15 for the season and 99 in his career. Zappe was 13 for 25 for 141 yards; he did avoid an interception for the first time in three games, the previous two in relief of Jones.

Tyreek Hill had two touchdowns among his 157 yards receiving to help the Miami Dolphins rout the Washington Commanders 45-15. The AFC East-leading Dolphins are 9-3 for the first time since 2001. Tua Tagovailoa was turnover-free after giving the ball away four times over the past two games. De’Von Achane ran for two touchdowns in his return after missing five of the past six with a knee injury. The Commanders have lost four in a row. Washington’s Sam Howell threw a pick-6 for a third consecutive game.

Detroit Lions 33–28 New Orleans Saints

Sam LaPorta had career highs of nine catches for 140 yards, including an early touchdown and a crucial first-down snag in the final minutes, and the Detroit Lions beat the reeling New Orleans Saints. Detroit improved to 9-3, their best record through 12 games since they went 10-2 in 1962. The Saints lost quarterback Derek Carr in the fourth quarter to back, shoulder and head injuries. Carr was hurt on a penalized hit by Bruce Irvin. New Orleans fell to 5-7, behind first-place Atlanta in the NFC South.

Kansas City Chiefs 19-27 Green Bay Packers

The Green Bay Packers picked up their fourth win in five games as they beat the defending Super Bowl champions. The 6-6 Packers are now in the NFC wildcard places after Sunday night’s win.

Denver Broncos 17-22 Houston Texans

Nico Collins had a career-high 191 yards receiving and a fourth-quarter touchdown, and Jimmie Ward intercepted Denver’s Russell Wilson in the end zone with nine seconds left to left to help the Houston (7-5) Texans hold on for a win over the Broncos. Ward leapt in front of intended receiver Lucas Krull to secure the fourth victory in five games for Houston and snap a five-game winning streak for Denver (6-6). Wilson was intercepted a season-high three times, all of them after halftime. Derek Stingley Jr had the first two picks for the Texans. Rookie CJ Stroud threw for 274 yards for Houston.

Indianapolis Colts 31-28 Tennessee Titans

Gardner Minshew threw a four-yard touchdown pass to Michael Pittman with 2:31 left in overtime and the Indianapolis Colts (7-5) beat the Tennessee Titans (4-8) for their fourth straight victory. The Colts had to score a touchdown after Nick Folk made a 46-yard field goal with 4:19 left in overtime to put Tennessee up. Tennessee lost their first true home game this season and have yet to win consecutive games. The Titans blew a 17-7 lead. Nick Folk missed his first extra point this season with 5:26 left in regulation, which would have put Tennessee up 26-25.

Miami Dolphins 45–15 Washington Commanders

Tyreek Hill had two touchdowns among his 157 receiving yards to help the Miami Dolphins rout the Washington Commanders (4-9). The AFC East-leading Dolphins are 9-3 for the first time since 2001. Tua Tagovailoa was turnover-free after giving the ball away four times over the past two games. De’Von Achane ran for two touchdowns in his return after missing five of the past six with a knee injury. The Commanders have lost four in a row. Washington’s Sam Howell threw a pick-six for a third consecutive game.

Atlanta Falcons 13-8 New York Jets

Desmond Ridder threw a 20-yard touchdown pass to MyCole Pruitt and the Atlanta Falcons took over sole possession of first place in the NFC South by slogging their way to an ugly victory over the punchless New York Jets.

The Falcons (6-6) have back-to-back wins for the first time since opening the season with victories over Carolina and Green Bay. Atlanta entered tied atop the division with New Orleans, who lost to Detroit.

But this game appealed only to fans of sloppy play, punting and penalty flags. The Jets (4-8) got an early safety but couldn’t get anything going – again – on offense in losing their fifth straight game. New York even pulled quarterback Tim Boyle and replaced him with Trevor Siemian in the fourth quarter to try to provide a spark, but it was more of the same misery in what appeared a half-filled MetLife Stadium.

Cleveland Browns 19–36 Los Angeles Rams

Matthew Stafford threw three touchdown passes, Puka Nacua became the first Rams rookie wide receiver to reach 1,000 yards in a season, and Los Angeles extended their winning streak to three games. The Rams have won three straight for the first time since winning the Super Bowl after the 2021 season. At 6-6, they are back in the playoff race after dropping three straight before their bye week. Joe Flacco was 23 of 44 for 254 yards with two touchdowns and an interception in his Browns debut. Cleveland fell to 7-5 and occupy the final playoff spot in the AFC.

Arizona Cardinals 24–10 Pittsburgh Steelers

James Conner ran for 105 yards and a pair of touchdowns against his old team as the Arizona Cardinals beat the Pittsburgh Steelers. It was the Cardinals’ first win at Pittsburgh since 1969. Arizona took control late in the first half with a 99-yard touchdown drive that ended with a five-yard strike from Kyler Murray to Trey McBride. The Cardinals led the rest of the way, enduring a pair of lengthy delays due to severe weather. The Steelers lost starting quarterback Kenny Pickett to an ankle injury late in the first half and scored their only touchdown in garbage time.

Carolina Panthers 18–21 Tampa Bay Buccaneers

Tampa Bay’s Mike Evans scored on a 75-yard reception and joined Jerry Rice as the only players in NFL history to string together 10 consecutive seasons with 1,000-plus yards receiving. Evans finished with seven receptions for 162 yards, increasing his season totals to 61 catches for 1,012 yards and 10 touchdowns. Rice has the league record of 11 straight seasons with more than 1,000 yards receiving. The Bucs won for only the second time in the past eight games. Carolina scored late to pull within a field goal, but No 1 overall draft pick Bryce Young threw an interception to end any chance of coming from behind to win in the Panthers’ debut under interim coach Chris Tabor.",NFL roundup: Pats hit new low as Lions reach 9-3 for first time since 1962,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/dec/03/nfl-roundup-sunday-scores-football,The Guardian
sports,Christy Doran,2023-10-26T22:19:21+00:00,"Four years ago, Rassie Erasmus delivered one of the great rugby speeches ahead of the 2019 World Cup final.

“You don’t have the right today to worry about your mistakes,” Erasmus said before the Springboks sealed a stunning 32-12 victory over England to claim their third William Webb Ellis Cup.

“If you worry about your mistakes today, you’ve got ego problems.

Facebook Twitter Whatsapp Reddit Email Share

“You are not representing yourself today. You are fighting for the things that happen in South Africa.

“You are tackling for the boy who didn’t get the same opportunities that you got eventually.”

Four years later and the “ego” Erasmus spoke about is what is driving the standards and expectations around the Springboks’ bid to go back-to-back.

“We explain to the whole squad why we are going a certain route. It is not about individual selection,” Springboks coach Jacques Nienaber said shortly after announcing two changes to his starting side and five in total, after going in with a forwards-heavy 7-1 bench split.

“It is for South Africa. As selectors we know there will be pressure on us if we don’t deliver a result but at the back of our minds we know this selection is for South Africa.

“The players take it like that. It is not about person or ego, not that they have egos, but you can’t think of that. You have to think about South Africa and the Springboks.”

Seemingly the Springboks are playing for more than themselves. They’re playing for their country.

It’s a powerful force, one that saw them progress through the knockout stages to reach the final after consecutive one-point victories.

Pressure? The South African laughs at the notion of what pressure is compared to the inequality and challenges the Rainbow Nation continues to experience.

The question is: how can New Zealand’s All Blacks withstand and overcome the hitherto unshakable wave of momentum and spirit the Springboks play with under Erasmus in this weekend’s World Cup final?

It would seem that, as the Springboks play for their country, the All Blacks are playing for themselves as much as anyone – and the generation of players and leaders that will call time on their international careers at week’s end.

The backlash and toxicity that followed their historic home series loss to Ireland was a humbling and public reminder of the expectation of being an All Black.

It’s why Saturday’s World Cup final is personal for the men wearing black.

All Blacks social media managers were forced to delete a thousand comments an hour following the humbling series loss in Wellington.

The pain of the days and weeks after that dark July, as well as the bumps and bruises along the way, including as recently as August when they suffered their biggest defeat to the Boks to lose the inaugural and prestigious Qatar Cup, still runs deep.

“It was quite special to hear some of the things those certain players said from the heart. You know, you think you know someone but once they open up and really be vulnerable in front of a team, it was quite special to hear,” back-rower Dalton Papali’i said this week.



“It was truly something special when you hear those boys open up. You know those leaders have been through a lot in their careers, the highs and the lows, the off-field and on-field stuff, and for them to open up, it sort of makes you feel welcomed and you want to play this game for them.



“There were a few tears and I think that’s awesome to see, players showing vulnerability, just opening up about how much this tour and this sort of game means.



“There were some (people) saying this is probably one of the most important games of All Blacks history. (The) All Blacks went through a bit of a hard path to get here, media, friends, family even criticising us and all that, and we stuck together. We weren’t even said to be in the final and now look at us, we’re here.

“Different players take it differently and some of the older players probably were hit a little bit harder and it was good to see just a bit of emotion and the want from them. Seeing that gives all the other players an extra two, three per cent to think ‘OK, we are going to the well and we’ve got to give it our all’.”

The All Blacks will experience a changing of the guard next season.

Indeed, the All Blacks’ social media channels described the team selection for the World Cup final as the “Last Dance”.

2015 World Cup winner Dane Coles will call time on his career, while his tight-five teammates Brodie Retallick and Sam Whitelock, who is bidding to become the first player to win the Webb Ellis Cup for a third time, will head overseas.

Fellow World Cup winners Aaron Smith and Beauden Barrett will also head to Japan.

Coles, who was labelled by Samisoni Taukei’aho as a “Grandad” type figure in the All Blacks, has even been denied the chance of a farewell send-off after missing selection.

“Yeah, tough,” said coach Ian Foster of the conversation with the 36-year-old around leaving him out.

“We don’t want to talk too much about post-game stuff, but that was a tough one, probably the toughest I have had as a coach. He took it the way I expected him to. He’s a champion.”

Papali’i said the All Blacks were intent on sending their leaders out on a high.

“There’s a few leaders in the team, it’s going to be their last game in the jersey, so it’s a big game for us and even the other players that are staying, knowing that we want to send those boys out on a high,” he said.

“How much they put into the jersey. We are standing on their…what’s that quote? It’s standing on the shoulders of giants.”

The generational change isn’t just occurring on the field but off it, too.

Foster will depart the All Blacks set up after 12 years, the last four as head coach.

It’s been far from smooth, having overseen their historic defeats to Argentina as well as the 2-1 series loss to Ireland on home soil.

A famous 35-23 win over the Springboks at Ellis Park saw him save his career, with Scott Robertson being lined up on the side.

But it wasn’t enough for New Zealand Rugby to back him before this year’s Test season got underway, with Robertson announced as Foster’s successor.

“Am I at peace?” Foster repeated a question during his World Cup team announcement when asked about where his mental state was ahead of his last Test in charge of the All Blacks.

“Yeah, I’m reasonably peaceful. I love the word but I’m not sure I’m peaceful right now.”

He added: “I’ve just started to get my back nice and straight from last year and now you’re trying to make me hunched over again!

“It’s the life of this business, it’s a tough game. It’s tough when you’re trying to get your performance right. It’s a tough game when people around you see things differently, but we’ve learned a lot about ourselves.

“We take massive pride in the jersey and making sure we reach the levels we want to. The rest of that is probably a conversation for another day.

“It hasn’t altered our vision of where we want this team to be. I know we’ve surprised a few people but I don’t think we’ve surprised ourselves.”","Legacy vs ego: The Springboks are playing for South Africa, the All Blacks are playing for themselves",https://www.theroar.com.au/2023/10/27/legacy-vs-ego-the-springboks-are-playing-for-south-africa-the-all-blacks-are-playing-for-themselves/,The Roar | Sports Writers Blog

Manchester City are looking to go back-to-back after their triumph in last season's Champions League, potentially becoming the first English club since Nottingham Forest in 1980 to successfully defend the trophy.

The likes of Bayern Munich, Real Madrid and Barcelona have also enjoyed strong group-stage campaigns and will surely be in the mix towards the sharp end of the competition. Atletico Madrid and Real Sociedad will complete the Spanish contingent in the next round.

Manchester United and Newcastle United will play no further part in Europe, though, having been eliminated by finishing bottom of their groups. Paris Saint-Germain will be in the Round of 16, though.

sports,Nick Musial,2023-12-07T22:11:00+00:00,"As fantasy football owners gear up for the last week of the fantasy regular season (in most leagues), our Week 14 fantasy WR PPR rankings are loaded top to bottom with just two teams on bye. Rolling out a strong receiving corps in a potential must-win week is essential, and we're here to shore up your start 'em, sit 'em concerns.

The highlight of our rankings is the long-awaited return of Justin Jefferson, who is (finally) set to suit up for the first time since Week 5. It's easy to forget, but in Jefferson's four full games this year, he averaged just over eight receptions and 135.8 yards per game while scoring three total touchdowns. Few receivers can dominate as he can, so we're happy to welcome him back.

Of course, Jefferson's return only helps one owner in each league, so let's break down the rest of the WR rankings to help you finish your season with a win.

Which WRs are on bye in Week 14?

The final set of bye weeks sees only the Commanders and Cardinals idle, resulting in the losses of Terry McLaurin, Marquise Brown, Jahan Dotson, Curtis Samuel, Rondale Moore, and Greg Dortch.

WEEK 14 PPR RANKINGS:

QBs | RBs | TEs | D/STs | Kickers

Even worse, Washington and Arizona sit as two of the weakest pass defenses in the league, so fantasy owners won't be able to count on big stats from their receivers going against the Commanders and Cardinals.

WEEK 14 STANDARD RANKINGS:

QBs | RBs | WRs | TEs | D/STs | Kickers

Who are the best fantasy WRs in Week 14?

The league's leading receiver, Tyreek Hill (vs. Titans in Week 14), stands as the unquestioned WR1 for Week 14 after torching the Commanders to the tune of five catches, 157 yards, and two TDs. CeeDee Lamb (vs. Eagles) and the Cowboys look to avenge their road loss to the Eagles in Week 9, as Dallas' WR1 routinely has double-digit reception potential.

Amon-Ra St. Brown (@ Bears) was relatively quiet this past week, but he's likely to rebound against a Bears defense that he totaled nine catches for 95 yards against in Week 11. A.J. Brown (@ Cowboys) reached the century mark for the first time in four games in Week 13, and another high-usage day looks to be in store for a potential shootout.

Keenan Allen (vs. Broncos) caught just five-of-nine targets last week, but as L.A.'s only reliable receiving option, a get-right game feels likely this week. Justin Jefferson (@ Raiders) is set to suit up for the first time since Week 5, and as we alluded to earlier, he's a must-start whenever he's active.

Stefon Diggs (@ Chiefs) hasn't totaled 100-plus receiving yards in any of his past six games, but he has every chance to get back on track against a Chiefs coverage unit that showed some leaks in Sunday's loss to the Packers.

WEEK 14 FANTASY ADVICE:

Sleepers | Busts | Projections | Start-sit

Who are the best fantasy WR sleepers, waiver pickups in Week 14?

Elijah Moore (vs. Jaguars), Noah Brown (@ Jets), Odell Beckham Jr. (vs. Rams), Jonathan Mingo (@ Saints), and Xavier Gipson (vs. Texans) are our preferred waiver-wire pickups in PPR formats for Week 14.

Moore (vs. Jaguars) just saw 12 targets from Joe Flacco and is in line for another high-usage day with Amari Cooper (concussion) potentially sidelined. Brown (@ Jets) should also see a steady target share after Tank Dell's (leg) season-ending injury.

Beckham Jr. (vs. Rams) is also likely to see increased usage with Mark Andrews (leg, ankle) done for the regular season. Mingo (@ Saints) has seen six-plus targets in his past four games, as his rapport with Bryce Young is strengthening by the week. Gipson led the Jets in receiving this past week (five receptions, 77 yards), and with New York routinely playing from behind, similar stat lines could be in the works.

WEEK 14 DFS:

DK lineup | FD lineup | Best values | Best stacks

Who are the biggest potential WR busts in Week 14?

It's tough to trust Calvin Ridley (@ Browns), Drake London (vs. Buccaneers), Jordan Addison (@ Raiders), and Jayden Reed (@ Giants) this week. Although Ridley has produced of late, a brutal matchup against a Browns coverage unit that entered Week 13 allowing the second-fewest fantasy points per game (FPPG) to WRs raises a red flag, and it's only compounded by the loss of Trevor Lawrence (ankle). London's week-to-week output is way too unpredictable, and with the fantasy season on the line for some of you, there's no reason to roll London out.

Addison is likely to take a step back with Jefferson back in the fold, while the Packers' receiving situation is too dispersed to put faith into Reed in PPR formats, though he might get a boost with Christian Watson (hamstring) banged up.

What are the biggest WR injuries in Week 14?

In Week 13, Demario Douglas (concussion) and Rashid Shaheed (thigh) missed game action, and Tank Dell (leg), Amari Cooper (concussion), Christian Watson (hamstring), and Marquise Brown (heel) exited early from their respective games.

UPDATE: Christian Kirk suffered a groin injury on Monday night, and he figures to be more doubtful than questionable for this week's game against Cleveland. If he's out, Zay Jones and Tim Jones will see more targets, but with Trevor Lawrence (ankle) also hurt, it's tough to count on either.

UPDATE: Douglas (concussion) has been ruled OUT for Week 14.

As usual, we'll update these WR PPR rankings throughout the week, so check back for the latest player movement and analysis.

sports,Martin Derbyshire,2023-11-06T21:23:22+00:00,"Prop bets are easy to understand and add a twist to most sporting events as you can bet on in-game events not tied to the outcome.

Prop bets are popular throughout the year and are posted for every major sport, but the pinnacle for prop betting is the Super Bowl. It’s the most popular day of the year for prop bets, which range from the typical to the exotic.

But you don’t have to wait for the Super Bowl to get involved in prop betting. See below for more on props, including the pros, cons, and prop bet examples from all the major sports.

What is a prop bet?

A prop bet is a “side bet” with a sportsbook on a specific event or statistical accomplishment within the game. These rarely have anything to do with the outcome of a game itself.

For example, you might bet on:

LeBron James scoring over 20 points in a single game

Dallas Cowboys gaining over 300 receiving yards in a game

Pros and cons of prop bets

Every bet has positives and negatives, and prop bets are no different.

Pros

The lines don’t usually move as fast as other bet types: Prop bet odds are developed based on game lines and totals at sportsbooks, but prop bet lines tend to adjust more slowly. Let’s say you’re keeping an eye on the New York Jets vs. the Buffalo Bills, and you see the total shift due to an incoming winter storm. While many bettors will scramble to get their bet in on the ‘under’ before the lines move too much, it’s a good idea to scope out the prop bets for individual players. The main lines are shifting, but most of the best sports betting sites don’t have the personnel to keep tabs on every possible player, so you could find value in an ‘under’ on a quarterback’s passing yards because the lines haven’t caught up yet.

There’s greater variety: The three main bet types—moneylines, point spreads, and totals—are constant in every major sport, but they don’t offer a lot in the way of variety. Prop bets do. They can add interest to a game that may seem one-sided in the major markets. Larger sporting events, especially the Super Bowl, offer a massive variety of bets, ranging from the typical to the exotic and everything in between.

They can add interest to a game that may seem one-sided in the major markets. Larger sporting events, especially the Super Bowl, offer a massive variety of bets, ranging from the typical to the exotic and everything in between. They are usually very easy to understand: Prop bets tend to ask a question of the bettor. Will a specific player hit a home run? Will Team X have over/under 3.5 field goals in a game? Will Team Y give up a powerplay goal? Whatever the question, prop bets are fairly easy to understand for the newcomer.

Cons

Props are difficult to research: Prop bets are so specific you’d think it would be easier to research them than other bet types, but the reality is that sports are extremely volatile. You can never truly predict how an athlete or a team will perform. This makes it very hard to nail down smart prop bets. For example, you could bet on a certain player to score ‘over’ a point threshold, but you lose because that player had an off-night, even though they might have easily won that bet in other recent games.

Prop bets can tie up your bankroll: We wouldn’t recommend using prop bets as your main bet type when building your strategy. Use most of your budget on more stable bet types, such as moneylines, spreads, or totals. Focus only a small percentage of your bankroll on props.

Focus only a small percentage of your bankroll on props. Exotic props are a guessing game: When large events like the Super Bowl roll around, you’ll be inundated with exotic and entertaining prop bets. These are almost impossible to research, and pure guessing isn’t good for anyone’s bankroll or betting strategy.

Prop bet examples for major sports

Every major sport with odds at the best sports betting apps will have prop bets. Below, we give examples of prop bets you might find when betting on major American sports.

NBA prop bets

The NBA offers a wide range of prop bets. They vary from player to team bets and lean heavily on the statistical side of the game. Some NBA prop examples include:

How many points a player will score

Number of assists or three-pointers a player will have

Which player will score the first basket of a game

You can also bet on team props, such as whether a team will lead at the end of a certain quarter or an over/under bet on the total number of points the team will score in the game.

See more: NBA prop bets

NFL prop bets

The National Football League is the king of sports betting, and NFL betting sites have no qualms about showcasing every kind of possible bet type for it.

Bettors will find many prop bet opportunities, especially for the Super Bowl. During the regular season, one of the most popular prop bet options includes the “anytime touchdown scorer” bet, where you can wager on a player to score a TD at any point in the game. Other prop bets can be focused on the team or even both teams.

See more: Super Bowl prop bets

MLB prop bets

MLB betting sites are no exception when it comes to offering prop bets. Like the other sports, MLB has prop bets focused primarily on individual players and statistical achievements like home runs, RBI, and strikeouts.

You might bet on an over/under for strikeouts for a starting pitcher in a game or even the number of bases a hitter will reach.

NHL prop bets

NHL betting sites have all of the props you’d expect from one of the major North American sports leagues, such as player assists or a certain player scoring a goal in a contest.

You will also find bets for shots on goal, team goals in a game, and which team will score first.

MLS prop bets

The demand for Major League Soccer betting has increased as the sport's popularity continues growing nationwide. Prop bets are just one of the many bet types growing at sportsbooks to keep up with the demand.

As expected, these prop bets often focus on individual players and their accomplishments, such as scoring a goal or collecting an assist in a game. Soccer betting sites also have props such as how many cards the two teams playing will combine to draw or a team’s total number of corner kicks.

How to read prop bet odds

Prop bets at US sportsbooks use the same odds as other major bet types like moneylines, point spreads, and totals. These odds, known as American odds, use negative and positive numbers to show you how much money you stand to win.

Positive odds show how much you stand to win for every $100 you wager. Let's say you wager on a quarterback to have over 2.5 touchdowns in a game at +145 odds, and he throws three in the game. If you wagered $100, you would be paid $245, your initial wager of $100 returned to you, plus $145 in winnings.

Negative odds tell you how much you need to wager to win $100. For example, if you bet a player will score less than 15.5 points in a basketball game at -135 odds, you would need to bet $135 to win $100.

Remember that you don’t have to wager that high or that low. Your payout will be calculated proportionally to your wager size when you finalize your bet slip.

What is an exotic prop bet?

An exotic prop bet is a non-traditional prop bet that is not focused on scenarios during a game. Instead, they can be as out of the ordinary as the sportsbook wants.

In the US, the most exotic bets are available during the Super Bowl, which is the most prominent sports betting day of the year and offers up hundreds of prop bets to interested bettors.

These bets can range from the number of songs sung during the halftime show to the result of the coin toss to the color of the sports drink dumped on the winning coach at the end of the game.

For the most part, you won’t come across too many exotic prop bets when using US sportsbooks, as many are just not legal bets. However, the largest sporting events, such as the Super Bowl or March Madness, will find sportsbooks offering up a wider range of prop bets. That’s usually when you’ll find more exotic props.

Sportsbook rules for prop bets

Before placing any kind of bet, we highly recommend you read the sportsbook’s terms and conditions. There, you will find all the rules for the various bets you will make.

While most sportsbooks’ rules are similar, there are always small variations in how they handle certain situations that could impact your bets.

One rule that is typically used by most sportsbooks involves player props. If you bet on a player and they don’t play in the game, most sportsbooks void the bet and refund your wager. But if that player is involved in the game even for a single play, then the bet stands.

We recommend reading through the T&Cs before placing any wagers so you’re not caught by surprise if an unexpected event should happen.

Eagles vs. Seahawks MNF odds + picks to consider: Use our bonus codes and links for the best football betting promos

Here are odds for tonight’s Eagles vs. Seahawks Monday Night Football game.

The Eagles and Seahawks come into this Monday Night Football game on troubling losing streaks. The NFC matchup has important playoff implications, particularly for Philadelphia.

Philly’s two-game losing streak has dropped them to second place in the NFC East behind the Cowboys, who are also 10-3 but have the tiebreaker thanks to their slightly better divisional record.

For a good stretch of the season, the Eagles appeared unstoppable and have been a favorite to return to the Super Bowl. After a surprising loss to the Jets in Week 6 (their first of the season), Philadelphia went on a five-game winning streak, impressively taking down top teams like the Dolphins, Cowboys and Chiefs. Most of those games were gritty, close wins, but then the Eagles dropped back-to-back games in blowout fashion to the 49ers and Cowboys, raising alarm bells amongst the Philly fanbase.

The Eagles are looking to rebound against a Seahawks team that has been reeling even worse, losing four straight. Sitting four games behind the 49ers in the NFC West, despite a disappointing season, Seattle still has a shot at a wild card playoff spot. After tonight’s game, the Seahawks’ schedule eases up a bit, with winnable games against the Titans, Steelers and Cardinals. But they could really use a victory to give them some confidence going into the final stretch.

How does golf betting work?

The most lucrative live bets in golf often revolve around backing players who've had a slow start but have the talent to stage a comeback.

The live odds set by sportsbooks for golf events are determined by continually evaluating player performance alongside considerations such as course dynamics, prevailing weather, and player stamina.

MLB live betting

The best sports betting apps offer live, in-game betting for Major League Baseball.

Live betting means you can bet on a game in progress, right down to what the next batter will do with the next pitch or what team will win the inning.

You’ll find live betting with top betting sites such as DraftKings, FanDuel, BetMGM, and Caesars.

The key to live betting is using a betting app to make your wagers. Apps allow you to track all of the changes — both on the diamond and in the odds — as they happen. You won’t find that response time at a brick-and-mortar sportsbook.

Some common MLB in-game betting lines includes:

Next team to score

Run line and moneyline odds

Total runs scored

Winner of the next inning

Player props, such as total hits or strikeouts

Bet on MLB run lines, moneylines, and totals

Three of the most popular bet types for Major League Baseball games are run lines, moneylines, and totals. In case you’re not familiar, let’s explain all three.

A moneyline wager is as straightforward as they come. You’re betting on which team you believe is going to win the game. Each team is given odds by the sportsbook to indicate their perceived chances of winning. The underdog is represented by a positive (+) number, and the favorite is represented by a negative number (-).

Similar to a point spread in other sports, the run line bet gives the underdog a handicap of 1.5 runs in the game. The underdog needs to lose by one run or win outright for bets on them to be successful, while the favorite in the game needs to win by two runs or more to cover the spread.

Totals bets, also known as over/unders, focus on the combined number of runs both teams score. Oddsmakers assign a total number of runs, and bettors must decide if the two teams will score over or under that predicted total. The actual winner of the game doesn’t matter.

You’ll find these staple bet types at every online sportsbook that supports MLB betting.

How to bet First 5 Innings in MLB

For bettors who prefer to focus on the early portion of a Major League Baseball game, First 5 Innings or F5 bets are ideal. These bets concern the outcome of just the first five innings of a game, which often takes out the uncertainty of relief pitchers replacing the starters.

You’ll find the F5 bets in the MLB tab of your online sportsbook or MLB betting app, where you can browse the available odds and lines for those particular wagers. You can still place bets on moneylines, run lines, or totals—focused on only the first five innings of play.

Keep in mind that the odds and lines will likely be different than those for the full game since they are concentrated on the first half of the game only.

Best MLB props and futures

MLB props and futures allow you to bet on team and player performance irrespective of individual game outcomes. Some examples of popular MLB futures odds and proposition bets include:

World Series: You can bet on which team you believe will become the next World Series champion. You’ll find World Series futures odds for these nearly as soon as the previous World Series comes to an end, and they’ll change based on offseason moves, team news, team performance, and more.

You’ll find World Series futures odds for these nearly as soon as the previous World Series comes to an end, and they’ll change based on offseason moves, team news, team performance, and more. MVP: Wager on the player you believe will take home the Most Valuable Player award for the season. This bet can be a fun way to keep tabs on certain players throughout the entire season.

Wager on the player you believe will take home the Most Valuable Player award for the season. This bet can be a fun way to keep tabs on certain players throughout the entire season. Home run leader: Which player do you think will crank out the most homers during the regular season?

Which player do you think will crank out the most homers during the regular season? Regular-season win totals: Make an over/under wager on a team based on the number of wins a sportsbook sets for them. Do you think your team will finish over that predicted win total, or will they come in under it?

Every sportsbook offers its own selection of futures and props bets, so shop around to find the sportsbooks that best fit your needs.

How to find the best MLB lines

It stands to reason that bettors always seek the most favorable MLB odds. “Line shopping” involves researching several different sportsbooks to compare odds.

This might involve using an odds feed, like the ones you’ll find here, or by comparing the odds on multiple online sportsbooks or MLB betting apps.

By doing this research, you’ll find the best odds for the bets you were already planning on making, which means you can maximize your potential return on your wager.

This can be a time-consuming process, but it also helps you boost your bankroll and give yourself the largest possible profit.

MLB betting rules at online sportsbooks

Every sportsbook has terms and conditions for all bets, MLB included. While those rules may be specific to each sportsbook, there are some general rules that should apply everywhere.

For example, MLB First 5 Innings bets are usually considered actionable after five innings of play, or 4.5 innings in the case of the home team having the lead.

Another rule many sportsbooks follow for baseball bets is weather-related, such as if a game is suspended due to rain or other weather conditions. These delays may lead to bets being refunded depending on the circumstances and the specific rules of your sportsbook.

Here are some other rules found at online sportsbooks for MLB betting.

Wagers include extra innings unless specified otherwise.

The game must start on the scheduled day (local stadium time) for bets to have action.

The game must go 9 innings or 8½ if the home team is winning for the run line to have action.

On ‘team to score first’ wagers, once a run is scored, the prop will be graded, regardless of how long the game lasts.

Wagers on postseason baseball series are based on the team to win the series, regardless of the number of games involved.

For player props, the player must be in the starting lineup for wagers to have action.

It’s important to read through the rules for baseball betting before placing your MLB bets, and you can find them in the terms and conditions section of your sportsbook’s website.

sports,Dan Treacy,2023-10-08T22:47:03+00:00,"Jerry Jones said earlier in the week that Sunday night's game would show him how the Cowboys stack up against the NFL's best.

The answer? Not very well.

Everything that could go wrong for Dallas on Sunday did go wrong, in a game that confirmed a 49ers team that ended the Cowboys' season in each of the last two years remains a level above its NFC counterpart.

The 49ers carved up Dallas' defense on the opening drive, and that was a sign of what was to come. Brock Purdy threw four touchdowns in the 42-10 rout, including three to George Kittle. Christian McCaffrey scored a touchdown for a 14th consecutive game as all of San Francisco's offensive weapons got involved.

MORE: Comparing stats for NFC stars Nick Bosa, Micah Parsons

Defensively, the 49ers were relentless. Nobody had a larger impact than Fred Warner, who finished the night with an interception, sack and forced fumble in a swarming performance.

The Cowboys' offense looked very much like it did in last season's playoff exit -- uncomfortable and out of sorts. Dallas was sluggish through the first half of the game, and the night unraveled quickly when Dak Prescott threw three interceptions in the second half. It got out of hand so quickly that Sam Darnold entered the game for the 49ers with more than 12 minutes remaining.

For Prescott and the Cowboys, questions about whether they can get over the hump against the class of the NFC will persist. While their wins have been dominant, Dallas already sits two games behind the Eagles in the NFC East.

The 49ers are rolling right along, with all of their major offensive weapons now healthy and the defense living up to its billing as well. San Francisco, now 5-0, doesn't face a team with a winning record until Week 10, though the Browns, Vikings and Bengals are far from automatic wins for Kyle Shanahan's team.

Cowboys vs. 49ers results, highlights from 'Sunday Night Football'

(All times Eastern)

Final: 49ers 42, Cowboys 10

11:26 p.m. — That'll do it! The 49ers trounce the Cowboys and reassert themselves as one of the NFL's most dominant teams. Through five games, San Francisco is unbeaten.

11:24 p.m. — These teams are trading possessions as the clock winds down. There was a brief skirmish officials had to break up as frustrations mount for Dallas.

11:14 p.m. — A sack by Kevin Givens ends Rush's first drive of the night and sets up a Bryan Anger punt. Backups are in nearly all around for the 49ers.

11:09 p.m. — Cooper Rush is in the game for the Cowboys...

11:07 p.m. — Mitch Wishnowsky with an excellent punt for the 49ers, who are just trying to get through the rest of the game injury-free.

11:04 p.m. — Sam Darnold has entered the game with 49ers. So, that's where we are with 12 minutes still on the clock.

11:00 p.m. INTERCEPTION — So much for that. Oren Burks gets the 49ers' third interception of the night as Prescott continues to struggle against this San Francisco defense.

10:59 p.m. — The Cowboys are moving the ball now, when it's a bit too late. Tony Pollard rips off a 26-yard run to finally break through.

49ers 42, Cowboys 10

10:53 p.m. TOUCHDOWN — And just like that, Jordan Mason runs in for another 49ers touchdown! This is ugly on all levels for the Cowboys, and Leighton Vander Esch is now down as well. 42-10, 49ers.

10:52 p.m. INTERCEPTION — Fred Warner now has a sack, forced fumble and an interception tonight. A pass from Prescott is deflected into his hands, and the 49ers have another instant scoring opportunity.

49ers 35, Cowboys 10

10:47 p.m. TOUCHDOWN — Purdy hits Kyle Juszczyk for the 49ers' fifth touchdown of the night. That's four touchdowns for Purdy alone, and San Francisco is pouring it all on the Cowboys.

End of third quarter: 49ers 28, Cowboys 10

10:43 p.m. — San Francisco is moving the ball inch-by-inch now, and the 'Niners are a yard away from making this a 25-point game.

10:38 p.m. — The 49ers are on the verge of entering the red zone after a 19-yard catch by Jauan Jennings. Purdy is up to 242 yards to go along with his three touchdowns.

10:32 p.m. INTERCEPTION — Prescott heaves it downfield under pressure and it's intercepted by Tashaun Gipson. For a Cowboys team that has embarrassed a few opponents this year, they might be on the bad end of an ugly game here.

49ers 28, Cowboys 10

10:27 p.m. TOUCHDOWN — Not one, not two, THREE touchdowns for George Kittle. The 49ers have everything working offensively tonight, and any Kittle fantasy owners are thrilled.

10:25 p.m. — Aiyuk's loss is Deebo Samuel's gain. Samuel goes 43 yards on the very next play, which tells you how automatic the 49ers' offense is right now. San Francisco is in the red zone looking to make this a three-score game.

10:23 p.m. — An offensive holding call wipes out a 40-yard gain from Aiyuk. Wow. That's a momentum swing. Spencer Burford is the culprit.

10:21 p.m. — The Purdy-to-Aiyuk connection continues to get stronger. Aiyuk goes for 23 yards to give the 49ers some breathing room after opening their drive with a false start.

49ers 21, Cowboys 10

10:17 p.m. FIELD GOAL — The 49ers' defense tightens the screws and limits Dallas to a field goal. Brandon Aubrey drills it from 50 yards out, and it's down to a 21-10 lead for San Francisco.

10:13 p.m. — Prescott hits CeeDee Lamb for a big 29-yard gain. That quickly takes the Cowboys into 49ers territory to start the second half.

End of first half: 49ers 21, Cowboys 7

9:58 p.m. — San Francisco's defense is all over the Cowboys yet again. It's Dre Greenlaw's turn to sack Prescott, and Dallas is waving the white flag on the half. They'll start the second half with the ball.

9:56 p.m. — 49ers edge rusher Drake Jackson is walking off after requiring some medical attention on the field.

9:52 p.m. — The 49ers tried to put something together, but a third down pass to Aiyuk was too low. Dallas has a minute to try and get something before halftime.

9:45 p.m. — The Cowboys looked better on third down on their last drive, but Prescott's third down pass to Ferguson is short of the line to gain and ends this drive quickly. The 49ers will have a couple minutes to blow this game open before halftime.

49ers 21, Cowboys 7

9:38 p.m. TOUCHDOWN — McCaffrey pushes through for the touchdown. That's his 14th consecutive game finding the end zone, and it puts the 'Niners back up two scores.

9:37 p.m. — Deebo Samuel takes some big hits but gets the 49ers down to the one-yard line. San Francisco is knocking on the door again.

9:35 p.m. — The Cowboys had done a pretty nice job of containing McCaffrey to this point, but the former Pro-Bowler takes a screen pass for 19 yards to push the Niners to the edge of the red zone.

9:31 p.m. — Aiyuk with a quick 15-yard catch to start the 49ers' drive. He's up to 35 yards on three catches.

49ers 14, Cowboys 7

9:27 p.m. TOUCHDOWN — KaVontae Turpin flashes his speed, gets separation, and hauls in Prescott's pass in the end zone! A perfectly drawn-up 26-yard play puts Dallas right back in this game.

9:24 p.m. — Prescott hits Jake Ferguson for a big third down conversion, and then some. That's 20 yards.

9:23 p.m. — Tony Pollard has had a tough night so far, with just 10 yards on six touches.

9:22 p.m. — Prescott fires a nice pass to Cooks to give the Cowboys another first down.

9:20 p.m. — The Cowboys have a first down! And it only took 17+ minutes. Dallas is still operating in its own territory, but it feels like points are needed on this drive to keep the game within reach.

49ers 14, Cowboys 0

9:14 p.m. TOUCHDOWN — That was quick! Purdy hits Kittle after some trickery, and it's a two-score night for the tight end. 49ers lead, 14-0.

9:13 p.m. — The Cowboys are forced to punt out of their own end zone after Fred Warner sacks Prescott. Warner now has a sack and a fumble. The 49ers will have strong field position.

9:10 p.m. FUMBLE — Oh no again! They're trading fumbles! Jourdan Lewis takes the ball right out of McCaffrey's arms and spoils the 49ers' hopes of making this a 14-0 game.

End of first quarter: 49ers 7, Cowboys 0

9:04 p.m. — Confirmed: 49ers ball. San Francisco has an instant opportunity here.

9:01 p.m. FUMBLE — Oh no! Pollard gets the ball knocked out deep in the Cowboys' own territory, and it looks like it was recovered by the 49ers. Officials are checking to make sure nobody was out of bounds, but that ball was very much out of Pollard's control. The 49ers could be set up in the red zone.

8:59 p.m. — The drive completely falls apart for the 49ers. A delay of game penalty sets San Francisco back, and Christian McCaffrey is dropped for a five-yard loss on 3rd & 15. Not allowing even a field goal is a huge win for Dallas.

8:56 p.m. — The 49ers are excelling on third down early in this game, and Purdy flips it to Kyle Juszczyk to keep the Niners' drive alive on 3rd & 1.

8:54 p.m. — Now Kearse lines up offsides... That extends the drive for the 49ers, who aren't moving as freely as they were on that opening drive.

8:50 p.m. — Jayron Kearse comes through with the Cowboys' first sack of the night, but Deebo Samuel makes up 11 of the 12 yards San Francisco needs on the next play.

8:46 p.m. — There's the first catch of the night for Lamb, but he doesn't get the first down and Dak Prescott is sacked by Nick Bosa to quickly end the drive. This 49ers defense has picked up right where it left off against the Cowboys in January.

8:44 p.m. — Dallas' second drive starts out with Tony Pollard getting dropped for a loss.

8:40 p.m. — Big-time stop by the Cowboys' defense as Johnathan Hankins deflects Purdy's third down pass with his helmet and forces a punt.

8:36 p.m. — The 49ers' defense was all over Dallas on that drive. Three plays, two incompletions, and now the Cowboys will punt it right back.

49ers 7, Cowboys 0

8:30 p.m. TOUCHDOWN — Purdy finds a wide open Kittle in the end zone for the score! That was a well-scripted opening drive by Kyle Shanahan, and San Francisco has an early 7-0 lead.

8:27 p.m. — A little bit of chaos as Deebo Samuel drops a ball that was pretty close to being a fumble, but it's all a non-issue as Dallas is hit with an offsides penalty. The 49ers are right about in field goal range.

8:25 p.m. — After a facemask penalty and a nine-yard pass to Brandon Aiyuk, the 49ers are already over midfield.

8:23 p.m. — Kickoff is a bit on the later end, but we are about to get underway. The 49ers will start with the ball.

8:10 p.m. — Jerry Jones said this week that this game will be a test of how the Cowboys match up with the NFL's best, as if there wasn't already pressure on Dallas to show something after the 49ers knocked them out of the playoffs in back-to-back years.

7:56 p.m. — Frank Gore and Vernon Davis are in the house! A couple greats from the 49ers' last golden era under Jim Harbaugh.

Frank Gore and Vernon Davis in the building for SNF 🔥 pic.twitter.com/XMKgK4aeaF — OurSF49ers (@OurSf49ers) October 8, 2023

7:36 p.m. — CeeDee Lamb is coming off back-to-back games with only four catches. Is he due for a huge performance tonight?

7:11 p.m. — New 49ers acquisition Randy Gregory is officially inactive against his former team.

7:01 p.m. — The Eagles are going to win in Los Angeles, so the 49ers need a win to keep pace atop the NFC. After they had to play the last two NFC championship games on the road, the No. 1 seed is undoubtedly in the back of their minds.

6:45 p.m. — The run of great prime-time weather continues, as it's set to be in the high 70s and sunny in Santa Clara tonight. No excuses for these powerful offenses.

The 49ers and Cowboys have a long history with one another, but San Francisco has gotten the better of Dallas in each of their last two meetings. The 49ers knocked the Cowboys out of the playoffs in both of the last two seasons, so a win for Dallas on Sunday could be helpful just from a psychological standpoint.","Cowboys vs. 49ers live score, updates, highlights from NFL 'Sunday Night Football' game",https://www.sportingnews.com/us/nfl/news/cowboys-49ers-live-score-highlights-sunday-night-football/e46d8e03c6a948aa82f859c3,Sporting News
sports,Nick Brinkerhoff,2023-09-28T21:41:00+00:00,"Travis Kelce has been catching a lot more than footballs lately, and fans everywhere have been swift to hop on the Taylor Swift bandwagon. The celebrity couple has been in the news for well over a week now, and despite the fatigue from many -- Chris 'Mad Dog' Russo's rant being among the most vocal -- companies like FanDuel just can't help but lean into a profitable storyline. Are they for real or is this ""Love Story"" just some extravagant publicity stunt?

Time will tell, but one thing's for certain when it comes to the media, social media, newspapers, football fans, Swifties, and just about everyone else within the 50 states and U.S. territories, including Puerto Rico and Guam: ""You need to calm down."" Regardless, Kelce and Swift take their tour on the road to Broadway, a place that puts on all the great shows. The traditional circus hasn't been in town for a few years now, but that's simply because the New York Jets exist and there was only room for one. It seems like ages since Aaron Rodgers marched out of the MetLife Stadium tunnel holding an American flag, but this is Zach Wilson's team now, whether you like it or not.

One of the most hyped ""Sunday Night Football"" games of the year was expected to feature Rodgers against Patrick Mahomes for the first time. Instead, we're more likely to be treated to non-stop split screens involving Swift and Rodgers, two people who won't be on the field. There will be some actual football, though, even if it is just a sideshow to the event everyone can't stop talking about. So, buckle up and enjoy whatever this is, and for all the fans paying ridiculous prices for a glimpse of Ms. Swift — make sure your phone is charged.

To Travis and Taylor, ""Welcome to New York."" It's been waiting for you. Well, actually, the swamps of northern New Jersey have. Enjoy the traffic and a look at the famous skyline.

For bettors, where there is hype, there's also an opportunity to make some money. FanDuel has released a special prop bets menu, cleverly called ""Prop Stars"" for the Swift-inspired wagers. Here's a look at how you can catch some cash in prime time.

FanDuel 'Prop Stars' Picks: Best bets for Travis Kelce & Taylor Swift-inspired props for Chiefs-Jets Week 4

Top of the Charts: Travis Kelce to have the Most Receiving Yards in the Game (+140)

The Jets know that Kelce is trouble long before he even walks in. If they want any chance in this game, they'll have to slow down No. 87. This is a New York defense that's been very good, although not quite great, over the last year and continues to improve. Robert Saleh's troops have held opponents in check, giving their anemic offense a fighting chance most weeks, but if there's one thing that Gang Green struggles to defend against, it's the tight end. They're giving up the fifth-most receiving yards to the position this season (56.3) and just allowed Pharoah Brown to beat them for a long 58-yard touchdown last Sunday. Getting +140 is a nice price for the best pass-catcher in this game, but there's too much blowout potential to warrant taking a flier here.

Our pick: Pass

Seeing Red: Chiefs to Win by 22+ (+380)

If this bet ends up cashing, the ""Seeing Red"" tagline would apply to a lot more than just Chiefs fans. Bettors would be in the green, and those wearing green would be the ones with red-ish, cartoon-like faces. Odds are, Wilson would have to be atrocious again considering New York's defense isn't a pushover. The Jets often like to make games close, even when they seemingly have no business in doing so. Even if they are steamrolled, a garbage time score is more than enough to ruin this wager.

Our pick: Pass

Opening Act: Travis Kelce First TD Scorer (+400)

Out of all the specials, this one is our favorite. The Chiefs will likely score first whether they get the opening kickoff or not. When we look at the Jets, we see an offensive coordinator that somehow underrated Micah Parsons and a team that refuses to take the training wheels off their former gunslinging quarterback. Wilson has turned into ""Checkdown Charlie"" as a result of conservative coaching, and we don't expect that to change in the early going. Lean into the narrative and sprinkle a little cash on Kelce to break the plane first.

Our pick: Bet on it

FriENDZONE: Travis Kelce to NOT score a TD (+120)

Obviously, based on our last recommendation, we're friendzoning this bet and not laying down any action on it.

Our pick: Pass

Running Away Together: Chiefs to have 150+ Total Rushing Yards (+420)

The strength of the Jets roster is along the defensive line, and the Chiefs are a pass-first team that loves to light it up through the air. This is the first time that Patrick Mahomes is playing in the New York area. He'll want to put on a show, and Andy Reid certainly isn't going to hold him back. Don't expect the Chiefs to start running until it's time to chew the clock.

Our pick: Pass

Seemingly Ranch: Travis Kelce Last TD Scorer (+550)

Ranch is a fine condiment and beloved by many, which makes this wager something that should be seen as an insult to ranch fans everywhere. Unless the Jets make this a close game or send it to overtime, we have a hard time believing that Kelce will even be on the field to score the last touchdown. Avoid this one like people with taste buds avoid bleu cheese and treat your nuggets with respect.

Our pick: Pass

Plot Twist: Zach Wilson to have 300+ Passing Yards (+1800)

If you asked the average Jets' fan what is holding this roster back, the overwhelming results would be Wilson. ""I'm the problem, it's me,"" would probably qualify as the lyrics played in his walk-up song if fans had anything to say about it. But Wilson doesn't have time to be the anti-hero, or villain, as traditionalists would say. He needs to flip the script and shake it off. The Jets need to let him sling the ball around the field instead of worrying about the bad turnovers. They aren't winning this game 14-10, and they aren't winning anything if they can't let their quarterback be who he is. Are we betting this? Absolutely not, but that would be one heck of a plot twist, right? Perhaps the script writers are working overtime.

Our pick: Pass

Platinum Performance: Travis Kelce to Score 3+ TDs (+2500)

When it comes to Kelce's greatest hits, he prefers to save them for division rivals like the Raiders and Chargers. In your wildest dreams this bet might hit, and it might happen in reality too. Kelce could be schmoozing in the suite when the second half begins rather than throwing blocks and catching footballs on the field. But if the Jets keep it close, they are prone to being exploited by players like Kelce. With receivers lacking on the Chiefs sideline, the tight end might put on a show that is typically only found in show business. Considering he hosted “Saturday Night Live” back in March, Kelce is familiar with how to tell a story. We have him scoring once, so what’s another two times to cash a monster long shot? Don't count on it, but don't rule it out either. And please, have fun and bet responsibly.

Our pick: Bet on it (with a small wager)

Exes & 0s: NY Jets to Score 0 Total Points (+3400)

The Jets are currently back in a familiar place as the laughingstock of the NFL. Swift, like many celebrities, has plenty of exes, but she always scores again. Maybe the haters are right. Maybe Kelce will be the subject of the next big hit. Maybe the publicists are cashing checks with this brilliant idea. Maybe it's real. Time will tell, but when the relationship inevitably falls apart like most dream celebrity couples do, there is always another someone. Point is, the Jets are without the quarterback they married, and now they're back together with Wilson. It's not glamorous, but they'll score again. Shutting out NFL teams is no easy task, but the Chiefs defense is much improved and the Jets look like a team that doesn’t have a quarterback. Don’t consider it likely to hit, but +3400 wagers hardly ever are. Consider this a fun bet, unless you’re a Jets fan, and see how long K.C. can keep NYC off the scoreboard. They might just do it for the entire game.

sports,Kyle Bonn,2023-12-13T20:52:15+00:00,"As Manchester United's season continues to slip away, the pressure around Dutch boss Erik ten Hag continues to get more palpable.

The latest slip saw the Red Devils crash out of Europe as they fell 1-0 to Bayern Munich on the final day of Champions League group-stage play, finishing bottom of their four-team group to leave them eliminated from Europe in their worst performance in the competition since 2005.

On top of that, they set the record for most goals against in a Champions League group stage by an English club, with 15 conceded in their six games. Their defensive record has collapsed as the season goes on: from a Premier League standpoint, they sit eighth in the English top flight, but their -5 goal differential is the worst of any club in the top 10.

With Jim Ratcliffe having now completed the formalities around his investment into the club, taking control of 25% of his boyhood club after a year of negotiations, the pressure will be piled on even more. Indeed, Ratcliffe wants United back at ""the very top of world football"".

The Sporting News has laid out all the options should Man United move on from Ten Hag and look for a new beginning, in the hopes of salvaging the 2023/24 season.

Man United next manager: Assessing candidates to replace Erik ten Hag

If Manchester United decide to pull the plug on Erik ten Hag's managerial tenure at Old Trafford, there aren't any perfect options for his replacement.

That allows us to speculate some as to who could slot in as the next man hoping to take United back to former glories, which still evade the club since the departure of Sir Alex Ferguson over a decade ago.

Zinedine Zidane

The former Real Madrid manager has been out of work since departing the Spanish club in 2021, clearly waiting for the right position to open up. He was heavily rumoured to be in line for the France position once the 2022 World Cup finished, but Didier Deschamps surprised many by signing a new contract.

Zidane would be a top choice for United, as he would be for many top clubs with a managerial vacancy, but there's questions around whether he would be open to signing on. The 51-year-old told Marca back in June of 2022 that he isn't exactly thrilled about a Premier League job due to the language barrier.

When asked specifically about a possible job opening in Manchester, Zidane said: ""I understand English, but I don't master it completely. I know that there are coaches who go to clubs without speaking the language, but I work in a different way. Many elements come into play to win. It is a global context."" Does he still feel the same way?

Graham Potter

While Potter's time at Chelsea crashed and burned, many still rate the former Brighton & Hove Albion boss highly and he could be in line for a project job such as this. Indeed, there have previously been rumours that Sir Jim Ratcliffe, the INEOS founder on the brink of purchasing a 25 per cent stake in United, would like Potter at the club. He has been out of work since his Blues tenure came to a close back in April, but it would be a hard sell to fans after his time with the London club went so poorly.

Roberto De Zerbi

One of the fastest rising managers in the game, Brighton manager Roberto De Zerbi is known for his tactical innovation in transitional play, and his name has cropped up a number of times when big clubs have an opening.

The 44-year-old Italian has led the tiny club to new heights, qualifying for the Europa League for the first time in club history and establishing themselves as top-four contenders, building upon the success under Graham Potter. Yet could Potter's failure at Chelsea cause some trepidation around another Brighton success story moving on up?

Michael Carrick

This list wouldn't be complete without mention of the likeliest of those with direct Manchester United links. Former United midfielder Michael Carrick, who made 316 appearances for the club over a 12-year Old Trafford tenure, is at Championship club Middlesbrough, his first permanent managerial appointment. They sit 11th in the second tier as of mid-December, just three points back of the playoff spots in a crowded top half.

Carrick's lack of experience is glaring, but hiring someone with deep knowledge of the club could be very enticing, and the fact he hasn't bombed in his first job is notable. The 42-year-old has also led the Red Devils before on a caretaker basis, installed back in 2021 after Ole Gunnar Solskjaer's dismissal and leading the club to some big wins over Arsenal in league play and Villarreal in the Champions League before Ralf Rangnick took over.

Hansi Flick

The former German national-team manager only lasted two years on the job with Die Mannschaft, before their failures at the 2022 World Cup caught up with him. Yet Flick has big club experience, having led Bayern Munich first as an assistant under Niko Kovac and then for two years as manager, winning the treble in 2019/20 en route to being named UEFA Coach of the Year.

Yet Flick's lack of experience of any kind outside Germany — he has just one year abroad, as an assistant at Red Bull Salzburg — coupled with his struggles at the national-team level could give some pause at bringing him to England for such a project position.

Antonio Conte

Former Chelsea and Tottenham boss Conte hasn't cropped up near the top of any betting lists, but there could be some sense in hiring the Italian to take over at Old Trafford. Conte has been out of work since his acrimonious departure from Tottenham this past summer, after he seemingly shoved his way out of the club amidst reports he was utterly miserable in London.

While the idea of a control freak such as Conte taking over the Manchester United mess could easily be a recipe for disaster, the club could also seek out a fixer of his nature, hoping for an immediate boost they can build on once things crumble under the Italian, as they often do. Still, the Red Devils would likely have competition as he seems to prefer working in his home country.

Julen Lopetegui

Fifty-seven-year-old Spanish boss Lopetegui represents maybe the perfect mix of experience, availability, and interest as Manchester United seek out possible new managers. Lopetegui is most known for his time in charge of the Spanish national team, where he succeeded Vincente del Bosque, but he also has big club experience at Real Madrid.

Lopetegui has also managed in the Premier League, seemingly on an upward trajectory at Wolves before abruptly leaving just days before the current season amidst tension with the board. And therein lies the issue around Lopetegui: he has left multiple positions in mysterious and awkward circumstances, with his Wolves exit reminiscent of his departure from the Spanish national team, where he suddenly departed just days before the start of the 2018 World Cup as news of his discussions with Real Madrid came to light. Between those two incidents, and his failed tenures at Madrid and Sevilla, would he be worth the risk at Old Trafford?

Names that don't make sense as next Man United manager

Julian Nagelsmann

While the German's name has come up in betting circles as a possibility for the next Manchester United manager, there's no sense to this actually taking place. Nagelsmann was only recently hired as the head coach of the German national team, meaning there's no chance he is available until after Euro 2024 at the earliest, and in that case, it's likely that Germany flopped at their own tournament, meaning his hire would probably be quite sour. This one just doesn't add up.

Lionel Scaloni

While it's conceivable that the Argentine could become available at a moment's notice amid speculation of his potential exit with the defending World Cup champions, this feels an unlikely pairing. Should he indeed leave Argentina, Scaloni has been open about his mental fatigue and is likely to take some time off from management. In the event he does return quickly, he's been heavily linked to Real Madrid as a possible replacement for the Carlo Ancelotti, who is expected to become the next permanent Brazil head coach.

It's hard to imagine that Scaloni, who seemingly craves stability and routine, has no experience at club level, and lacks ties to the Premier League or Old Trafford (beyond a brief loan spell with West Ham as a player in 2006) would be a match for Manchester United in any capacity.

Gareth Southgate

You can sense a trend here as another currently employed national-team manager is mentioned in England boss Southgate. While he's been linked to the United job before, it would take a perfect storm for him to be installed, whether on a permanent basis or as an interim stopgap option.

Some believe he could be considered next summer once the Euros are over: it has been speculated that Southgate could leave his England post following next summer's tournament, with his contract expiring in December next year. However, it's also possible he decides to stay on for the 2026 World Cup cycle, particularly if England have a good tournament in Germany. In that instance, he would only be available for double duty on a temporary basis, and that would simply be too messy to outweigh the benefits. Brazil are currently in that boat, and it's all gone wrong for Fernando Diniz despite his Copa Libertadores victory with Fluminense.

Mauricio Pochettino

In the event Todd Boehly proves to sport just as itchy a trigger finger as his successor Roman Abramovich at Chelsea, it's possible that Mauricio Pochettino becomes available should Manchester United look to move on from Erik ten Hag. But would he really be a sellable hire, having just failed in London after bombing at PSG and departing Tottenham in acrimonious manner? It seems unlikely that United would be interested in someone who demands significant club control and will have just been fired from a struggling league rival.

Manchester United managers since Sir Alex Ferguson

If Manchester United were to appoint a new manager, that person would be the ninth coach to take charge of a United team following Sir Alex Ferguson's retirement in May 2013, including caretaker/interim managers Ryan Giggs, Ralf Rangnick and Carrick.

The San Francisco 49ers entered Week 6 riding a 15-game winning streak and looking unstoppable with a young quarterback, Brock Purdy, who was making the game look easy. They exited with a 19-17 defeat at Cleveland, injuries to key players and, for the first time this season, a question mark or two.

With the previously unbeaten Philadelphia Eagles also losing ugly Sunday, this edition of the Pick Six column addresses key questions facing Super Bowl favorites with one-third of the 18-week regular season nearly complete.

So far this season, we’ve seen the Miami Dolphins set NFL records for offense, only to lose by four touchdowns in their lone game against a true contender. We’ve seen the Kansas City Chiefs win with defense, sometimes in spite of their offense. We’ve seen the Buffalo Bills incur devastating injuries. Here we’ll address 10 teams with the shortest Super Bowl odds, running through what I think and what NFL insiders have to say.

The full Pick Six menu this week:

• Unanswered questions for contenders

• When “playing to win” goes too far

• Championship roster, rookie kicker

• Do they make wristbands for coaches?

• Giants, Vikings and winning too soon

• Two-minute drill: Wackiest win in a while

GO DEEPER The Eagles' 'tush push' play is taking over the NFL. But is it working?

1. Where do the top 10 current Super Bowl contenders stand one-third of the way through the season? Let’s hit key questions facing the Chiefs, Eagles, 49ers, Bills, Bengals, Cowboys, Ravens, Lions, Dolphins and Jaguars.

You can scroll through the latest Super Bowl future odds from BetMGM below.

• San Francisco 49ers: What do they have in Purdy?

What I think: Let’s start with what the 49ers do not have in Purdy. They do not have an AFC North-certified, weatherproof Ben Roethlisberger clone able to overpower the elements, break away from defensive linemen and thrive in the conditions Purdy faced against Cleveland. What they do have is a good, young quarterback well-suited to run Kyle Shanahan’s offense at a high level by making quick decisions when given time to find open receivers.

Exec comment: “The 49ers knew they needed a good quarterback to win the Super Bowl, and they knew they could help Purdy be that. Give him a great receiving tight end, two good receivers and a great halfback who fits the system, and they’ll get someone open on every pass play. But then Deebo Samuel gets hurt, Christian McCaffrey gets hurt, and now we don’t have as many guys open. Especially when you face a defensive coordinator who says, ‘You show me you can beat me throwing the ball outside the numbers — best of luck, and to do that, you are going to have to take a five-step drop and I’m going to have Myles Garrett chasing you every play.'”

• Kansas City Chiefs: Is the explosive passing game gone for good?

What I think: The Chiefs have never scored less per game on offense through six games or a full season since Patrick Mahomes became their quarterback. They have also never enjoyed larger average point differentials (9.8 per game), because their defense is so much better. I think the pass offense will become slightly more explosive as Mahomes gets reps with his receivers, but I’m not expecting a huge shift.

The Chiefs are averaging 9.5 plays per touchdown drive when starting at least 70 yards from the opponent’s goal line, per TruMedia. That figure was 7.8 in Mahomes’ first year as the starter and has climbed every season since. It’s a testament to the Chiefs’ adaptability, but also a reflection of plummeting explosive play rates.

Exec comment: “Yeah, it looks harder for them on offense until Mahomes finds (Travis) Kelce on every major third down, every major two-minute play, every major touchdown. Kansas City has the luxury of their best players being their toughest players. Chris Jones is a very tough player. Kelce is a very tough player. Mahomes is a very tough player. You wonder why they win the games? Because the games are won by the toughest teams most of the time.”

• Philadelphia Eagles: Has Jalen Hurts regressed? Where are the explosive pass plays?

What I think: Explosive passing is down through most of the league, including for the Eagles. They are gaining more than 15 yards on just 11 percent of pass plays, down from 21 percent through six games last season and 19 percent for 2022 overall. Jalen Hurts, A.J. Brown, DeVonta Smith and Dallas Goedert are still on the team, so I’m inclined to trust the production will return. But there’s also a lingering fear defenses have caught up to aspects of the Eagles’ scheme. Does Philly have a counterpunch?

Advertisement

Exec comment: “People are going to crush Hurts and the offense. They are just churning the clock so much. It just feels like they are imposing their will on teams through the run game and through their short passing and it just hasn’t taken off from an explosive passing standpoint, so when they play a team that can move the ball on them through the air, it presents some challenges.”

• Buffalo Bills: Are the defensive injuries too much to overcome?

What I think: The rest of the conference is the key variable. The Bills are diminished. They have imperfections. But Buffalo already defeated the Dolphins. The other AFC teams aren’t exactly peaking. Kansas City and Cincinnati appear easier to defend this season than in the recent past. We’ll see how well the Dolphins hold up. This can still be Buffalo’s season.

Exec comment: “Matt Milano and Tre’Davious White, those are huge injuries for that football team. The Bills are not as dominant as they felt going into it with so many injuries on defense. But the division they are in, they will still be able to slug it out and get to where they need to go. Nobody has really emerged in the AFC to unseat these teams at the top.”

• Miami Dolphins: Has Tua Tagovailoa proven he’s built to last?

What I think: It was tough watching Tagovailoa last season without worrying for his physical well-being. I’ve never felt that way watching him so far this season, and will feel even better if he plays a full game against Philadelphia in Week 7. New England, Kansas City, the Jets (twice), Washington, Tennessee, Dallas, Baltimore and Buffalo will all get their shots at Tagovailoa. I’m cautiously optimistic, but think there will be games when defense muddy the picture sufficiently to create turnovers.

Exec comment: “Interesting team. They put up 70 on Denver and should have put up 70 on the Giants. No one can keep up with that kind of firepower. But they also haven’t really beaten anyone. They were down 14 points to Carolina. Do you think they are coming back from 13 down against Philly? In my opinion, no.”

• Dallas Cowboys: Is this team any better than previous Dallas teams that fell short?

What I think: It’s a tough time to evaluate the Cowboys fairly because they were so bad against San Francisco on a big stage in their most recent game. I just don’t see where Dallas is better or going to get considerably better, especially on offense. And every time they enjoy success, they seem to enjoy it a little too much. That is a reflection of their owner.

Exec comment: “Run defense and consistency on defense, and then offensively, what is their identity? They just are not very good. Their best games are when they play great defense and get turnovers, but that is not going to happen enough, especially against the good teams.”

• Detroit Lions: Have they fixed their defense?

What I think: The Lions are 11.3 EPA per game better on defense from last season to this season, the second-largest gain for any team since last season. The schedule has something to do with that, but the 2022 defense was so bad, it couldn’t stop Carolina. Detroit will win the NFC North and return to the playoffs, which will make this season successful no matter what happens from there. But we won’t find out until the postseason just how much better the defense might be, because the remaining schedule features so many weak offenses. That includes Chicago twice, Green Bay, Denver and Las Vegas.

Exec comment: “Yes, I do buy them. This is a league full of teams who do not really know who they are week to week. Detroit knows who they are, and they play to their identity. Anytime you know who you are and play to that style, you have a chance to be dangerous.”

• Baltimore Ravens: Are the Ravens better off shifting to more of a pass-oriented offense?

What I think: Baltimore has never scored fewer points or amassed less offensive EPA through the first six games of a season with Lamar Jackson in the lineup. The schedule and injuries have played roles, but with the Ravens shifting toward a more conventional pass offense, are the explosive quarterback runs mostly in the past? Jackson has one rush longer than 20 yards (he’s had four or five by now previously). He’s gaining at least eight yards on 15 percent of carries, half his previous rate. I’m not expecting a consistent precision passing game to suddenly materialize. Will this new offense be tougher to defend?

Advertisement

Exec comment: “The defense keeps them in it, but I don’t necessarily think this offensive change is going to make them any better when it counts. Lamar Jackson does not appear as dynamic as a runner, but in this offense, he does not need to be. He is regulated to pass from the pocket, but you are taking away the biggest weapon the offense had when you do that. Odell (Beckham) is not that guy anymore. Who are you truly afraid of on that offense? Nobody but Lamar, and if you are not using Lamar in a certain capacity, he becomes just like the rest of these quarterbacks around the league — hit or miss.”

• Jacksonville Jaguars: Are they ready for prime time?

What I think: Trevor Lawrence’s knee injury was the big concern coming out of Sunday. If he’s out, expectations shift dramatically. More than the other AFC contenders, the Jaguars seem early in their life cycle, still finding their way. That makes them a little harder to trust in big spots but also leaves greater space for growth. Let’s hope those test results on Lawrence’s knee come back clear.

Exec comment: “I like Jacksonville. Doug (Pederson) has a championship pedigree. This team is relatively young. They are scrappy. The fact that they have been there before gives them a chance. I think the quarterback is growing.”

• Cincinnati Bengals: Can Joe Burrow hold up for a full season?

What I think: Burrow is looking healthier over the past two weeks. The bye week comes at a great time for Burrow to get even healthier, but check out the schedule on the other side: San Francisco, Buffalo, Houston, Baltimore, Pittsburgh and Jacksonville. Cincy still has a second game with the Steelers, plus games against Kansas City and Cleveland. I’m worried Burrow will wear down against these defenses.

Exec comment: “You cannot always expect Joe Burrow to create magic with a bottom-half offensive line. The line is my concern all the way.”

2. Are teams sometimes going too far playing to win? The Eagles come to mind after falling 20-14 to the Jets.

Most would agree teams have gotten smarter in their handling of fourth-down situations, going for it when it makes sense, instead of punting almost out of habit. Making the aggressive play to win can absolutely be the smart play, regardless of results. It’s progress when teams seriously wrestle with these questions, not just on fourth down, but in all aspects of their strategy.

But when the Eagles tossed a killer interception on third-and-9 from their own 46-yard line while protecting a 14-12 lead against the Jets with two minutes left in the fourth quarter, a longtime NFL exec reached out with a question: “Have we come too far with coaches wanting to ‘win’ the game instead of sometimes being more traditional?”

His point: Philadelphia could have run the ball on third-and-9, then punted from around midfield. The Jets would have taken possession with barely more than a minute remaining, no timeouts and Zach Wilson behind center facing a ferocious Eagles pass rush. Was having Hurts pass in a situation when gaining a first down is unlikely the smart play under the circumstances?

“Are coaches not willing to go against the slight statistical benefit that WPA (win probability added) provides?” the exec asked. “Is it no longer OK to let your defense win the game when it clearly has a huge talent/performance advantage? This Eagles game was 14-12, not 37-35.”

Critics attuned to the trend toward aggressiveness pounce when teams pass up chances to go for the kill. Coaches know team owners tend to be fans, not football strategists. They know owners listen to these criticisms. That can provide an incentive to make the aggressive play, to go down swinging.

“Everybody thinks they are playing Brady, Manning or Rodgers in two-minute,” a veteran coach said. “If before the game someone offered Philly to put its defense against Zach Wilson on a need-field-goal drive starting inside his own 15 with no timeouts and a minute left, you think they would have taken it?”

In the situation Sunday, the Jets’ offense had netted 19 yards on its previous three possessions, producing one field goal on a drive that gained 16 of those yards. The Eagles had already suffered three turnovers. They knew Wilson would be taking over deep in his territory with very little time remaining.

“To me, these are exactly the type of factors that a coach needs to consider when deciding,” the exec said. “I think they were ignored here.”

The situation Philly faced against the Jets was the seventh time since 2000 that a team leading by 1-2 points in the final two minutes faced third down with 7-10 yards to go from the minus-40 yard line to midfield, with the opponent holding no timeouts.

Three of the seven teams passed, resulting in one first down, one sack and Hurts’ interception. Of these three teams, only the Eagles lost the game.

3. The 49ers lost Sunday when their rookie kicker missed from 41 yards. Is San Francisco wise trusting a championship roster to a rookie’s foot come playoff time?

The 49ers raised eyebrows among some when they used their second-highest pick in the 2023 draft — a third-round choice, 99th overall — for a kicker. The selection of Michigan’s Jake Moody gave the 49ers a cost-effective successor to veteran Robbie Gould. General manager John Lynch called Moody a potentially “foundational” player whose stock in the draft was so high, other teams were trying to trade ahead of San Francisco for a shot at him.

Who do you want lining up the potential winning kick in a Super Bowl? It’s an interesting question in a season that has seen Moody and Saints rookie Blake Grupe miss game-winning tries, but the data could be on the 49ers’ side.

FGA Dist Rookies Veterans <33 Yds 97% [31-32] 94% [330-351] 34-44 Yds 75% [21-28] 82% [230-279] 45-50 Yds 78% [7-9] 73% [121-165] 51-55 Yds 100% [8-8] 59% [33-56] 56+ Yds 0% [0-1] 55% [6-11] Totals 86% [67-78] 84% [720-862]

The table above shows field-goal make rates in the postseason since 2000 for rookie kickers vs. veterans. The numbers stack up pretty evenly across various distance cutoffs. Based on these numbers, there’s no statistical indication rookies are less effective in the postseason.

“Playoff teams have a different aura, different feel in the locker room,” a veteran evaluator said. “Percentages are one thing, but who is the guy who trots out there to try the game-winner? It’s a different pressure shooting free throws up by 20, down by 20, than in that type of situation.”

Fans might recall rookie kickers missing playoff kicks: Rodrigo Blankenship with the Colts in 2020, Harrison Butker with the Chiefs in 2017, Nate Kaeding with the Chargers in 2005. But the NFL has seen plenty of rookies kick effectively in the postseason as well. Evan McPherson made all 14 postseason tries with the 2021 Super Bowl Bengals. The 2017 Eagles won a Super Bowl with rookie Jake Elliott performing well. The 2012 Super Bowl champion Ravens had rookie Justin Tucker, while the 2006 Patriots trusted rookie Stephen Gostkowski.

4. Do they make wristbands for head coaches? That is not the only question facing the Broncos.

Denver Broncos coach Sean Payton has made clear his frustration with quarterback Russell Wilson in myriad ways, including when he suggested Wilson could at some point wear a wristband if it would help speed up communication in the huddle.

We joked on the Football GM Podcast that the head coach himself could have used a wristband to assist with game management after the Broncos called timeout before punting with 22 seconds left in the first half of a 19-8 defeat at Kansas City in Week 6. Payton said he thought Denver was heading into third down, not fourth, when he called timeout, helping the Chiefs’ drive to a field goal.

It wasn’t an isolated miscue. Denver has twice this season used all three timeouts with at least four minutes remaining before halftime. Payton suffered that fate only four times in 258 total games coaching the Saints, when his association with Drew Brees was one of the most successful partnerships in recent NFL history. Payton has had it happen twice in six games with Wilson as his quarterback.

Across the league, teams have used all their first-half timeouts above four minutes just 14 times since 2020. That includes six times by Carolina when Matt Rhule coached the Panthers. Payton is the only other coach with more than one such game over the past three-plus seasons.

The irony is rich in Denver, where Payton’s predecessor, Nathaniel Hackett, was mocked for his game management so thoroughly, the team made him hire veteran assistant Jerry Rosburg to help him after only three games (Denver was 2-1 at that point). The Broncos under Hackett had trouble getting out of the huddle on time.

Hackett took the hit for those issues, but when the problem recurred under Payton, the blame shifted to Wilson, the common denominator.

All of this is pointing toward a future in Denver that includes Payton but not Wilson. Payton’s game plans over the past two weeks were conservative enough to suggest the coach was publicly demonstrating he does not think he can run his offense as currently configured, despite some success on the ground. These game plans were conservative enough to signal a potential in-season quarterback change. Denver faces Green Bay and Kansas City over the next two weeks before heading into its Week 9 bye.

5. You play to win the game, but can you win too quickly? The Giants and Vikings are test cases.

The New York Giants and Minnesota Vikings exceeded expectations under first-year head coaches in 2022. Both reached the playoffs. Both are struggling in their second seasons, facing difficult questions about the future. Would they have been better off enjoying only moderate success early? That could depend on how well the football leadership has communicated with ownership.

Every head coach and general manager wants to win as much as possible, but the goal is to build for the long term, which can require time to do things with sustainability in mind. Bad teams that win right away can reset expectations for fans and ownership, making it less practical to take one step backward in the short term for a better shot at taking two steps forward down the line.

What do the Giants’ and Vikings’ ownerships think?

“The best first year can be that 7-10 season where you show some promise,” a veteran coach with experience on a half-dozen teams said. “The Giants won a bunch of games early, people were heaping praise on the head coach, people get the expectation of what the quarterback can be. But oftentimes, you know different internally because you know the house you are living in. You are inside the walls every single day and you know where the roof leaks, where the foundation is cracked.”

Buffalo managed such a situation well. The Bills surprisingly reached the playoffs in their first season under Sean McDermott, a euphoric moment after a 17-year playoff drought. They went 6-10 the next year, then began a steady rise behind Josh Allen and a top defense. There isn’t a Josh Allen on the Giants or Vikings.

Minnesota in particular finds itself in an interesting spot, with Kirk Cousins approaching free agency and playing well enough, most likely, to keep the Vikings from climbing too high in the draft order.

“They already gave a contract to (tight end) T.J. Hockenson, and they are going to give one to (receiver) Justin Jefferson,” an exec said. “Now, what? Are you going into the rookie pool and taking the fourth-best quarterback in the draft? You can look like Atlanta with (Desmond) Ridder pretty quick.”

6. Two-minute drill: There were already many ways to win a game before the Dolphins invented another one.

The Dolphins were one of 223 teams since 2000 to be favored by at least 13.5 points in a regular-season or playoff game. Seventeen of those 223 teams fell behind by 14 or more. Six of the 17 won anyway. The Dolphins were the only one of those 223 teams to win and cover the spread, which was 13.5 for this game.

• Six catches for 163 yards and a touchdown against Carolina left the Dolphins’ Tyreek Hill with 812 yards through the first six games. That ranks second in NFL history to Hall of Famer Don Hutson, who had 819 yards through six with Green Bay in 1942.

Receiving Yards Through Six NFL Games Rk Player Season Yds 1 Don Hutson 1942 819 2 Tyreek Hill 2023 812 3 Wes Welker 2011 785 4 Elroy Hirsch 1951 766 5 Santana Moss 2005 743 6 DeAndre Hopkins 2015 726 7 Raymond Berry 1960 725 8 Jerry Rice 1986 723 9 Bob Boyd 1954 718 10 Bobby Mitchell 1962 714

• Jared Goff is enjoying the second-best start to a season for his career from a statistical standpoint, behind only his 2018 Super Bowl season with the Rams. With the Lions at 5-1 and Goff heading toward a likely contract extension, could another team come after his injured backup, former University of Tennessee quarterback Hendon Hooker?

Randy Mueller raised the thought last week, recalling examples from his career as a GM when offering a pick one round higher than a prospect’s actual draft round proved alluring. Detroit used a third-round choice for Hooker, who is recovering from ACL surgery. Hooker would have been valued higher if healthy. Could that be true again at some point in the future?

• News that Indianapolis Colts rookie quarterback Anthony Richardson might undergo season-ending shoulder surgery could carry a silver lining. Richardson got to play enough for the Colts to evaluate where he stands, but if he shuts it down for the season, neither he nor the team would have to suffer through a full season of growing pains. Gardner Minshew’s three-pick game against Jacksonville on Sunday works against the idea Indy is better positioned to compete with the journeyman in the lineup, but most coaches and execs I’ve spoken with believe that to be the case in the short term.

The Football 100, the definitive ranking of the NFL’s best 100 players of all time, goes on sale this fall. Pre-order it here.",N.F.L. Executives on the Biggest Questions Facing Super Bowl Contenders,https://theathletic.com/4964039/2023/10/16/nfl-news-week-6-super-bowl-favorites-broncos-dolphins/,The New York Times
sports,Sam Eggleston,2023-11-01T22:50:52+00:00,"Point spread betting is a bet on the difference in the score between teams (or players) in a specific game or event. The favored team is provided a point spread or handicap to try to equalize the odds with the less-favored team.

To place a point spread bet, select either the favored team or the underdog and predict if they will surpass or fall short of the given point spread. The odds for both teams are set to try to even out the bets on both sides.

The best sports betting sites provide a daily menu of point spread bets in dozens of sports and events.

What is a point spread bet?

A point spread is a predetermined margin set by bookmakers to level the playing field between two teams. Then, you bet on whether:

The favored team will win by more than the spread

or

The underdog will lose by less than the spread (or just win outright)

In a point spread, the favorite is the team expected to win and is typically assigned a negative point value, indicating the number of points by which they need to win for a bet on them to be successful.

The underdog is the team expected to lose and is typically assigned a positive point value, indicating the number of points they can lose by for a bet on them to be successful.

If the underdog wins the contest outright, they’re also the spread winner.

What does betting ‘against the spread’ mean?

Most generally, betting against the spread just means placing a point spread bet.

You’re betting on the underdog to either win outright or lose by fewer points than the specified point spread, or you’re betting on the favorite to win by a margin greater than the specified point spread.

In a secondary definition that distinguishes between betting “with the spread” or “against the spread,” the latter term means you’re betting on the underdog.

What does ‘covering the spread’ mean?

Covering the spread means that a team has surpassed the expectations set by the point spread and, thus, won the bet.

For the favorite, it means they won by more than the specified number of points. For the underdog, it means they either won outright or lost by fewer points than the specified spread.

How do point spread odds work?

Alongside point spread bets, the odds will indicate the potential payout relative to the wagered amount. These odds are typically close to even because the point spread is designed to level the playing field between two teams.

The odds can be presented in various formats, such as American (e.g., -110 or +110), Decimal (e.g., 1.91), and Fractional (e.g., 10/11), each providing a different way to express the same potential payout.

Do point spread odds change?

Yes, point spread odds can change, and these shifts are commonly referred to as ""line movement.""

Lines move when the point spread or the odds associated with a particular bet change after sportsbooks have initially set them. There are several reasons for these adjustments.

One of the most common causes is an imbalance in the amount of money being wagered on one side of the bet. If a significant majority of bettors are placing their money on one team to cover the spread, the top sports betting apps will adjust the point spread to make the other side more appealing, thereby balancing the betting action.

Another factor that can affect the spread odds is the occurrence of unexpected events, such as injuries to key players, changes in team strategies, or even significant weather events that might impact a game's outcome.

For instance, if a star quarterback is announced as injured just days before a big game, the point spread might shift in favor of the opposing team.

Moreover, information and public perception play a role. If a piece of news or a prevailing sentiment starts to gain traction about a particular team's increased chances of winning, this can influence how people bet, leading sportsbooks to adjust their lines accordingly.

Point spread odds can and do change based on a combination of actual betting patterns, unexpected events, and shifts in public perception. Savvy bettors keep a close eye on these line moves, as they can offer insights into where the value lies in a particular bet.

Point spread betting outcomes

When placing a point spread wager, there are a few potential outcomes:

The favorite can cover the spread by winning by a margin greater than the specified point spread

The underdog can either win the game outright or lose by fewer points than the spread, thereby ""covering"" the spread themselves

There's the possibility of a ""push,"" where the difference in the game's score exactly matches the point spread, resulting in the return of the original bet to all bettors

How to win a point spread bet

Suppose an NBA betting site has set the point spread for a Los Angeles Lakers-New York Knicks game at the Lakers -7.

This means the Lakers are the favorites and are expected to win by 7 points.

If you place a spread wager on the Lakers, to win your bet, the Lakers must win the game by more than 7 points.

Let's say the final score is Lakers 110, Knicks 100. The Lakers won by a margin of 10 points. Since this is more than the 7-point spread, if you bet on the Lakers, you would win your wager.

How you lose a point spread bet

Say an NFL betting site has set the point spread for a Chicago Bears-Miami Dolphins game at the Bears -4. This indicates that the Bears are the favorites and are expected to win by 4 points.

If you make a spread bet on the Bears, you're betting they'll win by more than 4 points.

However, let's assume the final score turns out to be Chicago Bears 24, Miami Dolphins 23. In this scenario, the Bears have won the game by only a 1-point margin.

Since this is less than the 4-point spread, if you had the Bears, you would lose your wager. Despite the Bears winning the game, they failed to ""cover"" the 4-point spread, leading to a loss for those who wagered on them.

What is a push in a spread bet?

A ""push"" in betting refers to a situation where the final result of an event matches the set point spread, resulting in neither a win nor a loss for bettors. When a push occurs, the wagers are typically refunded.

For instance, let's consider an NFL game where the Dallas Cowboys are favored by 7 points against the Philadelphia Eagles.

If the game ends with the Cowboys winning by exactly 7 points, those who bet on either team experience a push. Their wagers would be refunded as the Cowboys neither exceeded nor fell short of the 7-point spread.

Sportsbooks often employ half-points in their lines to avoid this scenario. (They don’t want to return bets.) For example, if our point spread was Cowboys -7.5, the game could not possibly end in a push.

Point spread betting by sport

Spread betting is popular across sports, but there can be slight differences. Let’s break it down.

Point spread odds in football

Say a hypothetical NFL point spread for the Patriots and Steelers has the Patriots as -5.5 favorites. If you bet on the Pats, they must win by 6 or more points for a winning wager. Betting on the Steelers would win if they either win outright or lose by 5 or fewer points.

Point spread odds in basketball

Say an NBA point spread has the Warriors as -9 favorites over the Raptors. To win a bet on the Warriors, they need to win by 10 or more points. Bets on the Raptors would win if they either win outright or lose by 8 or fewer points.

If the score is Warriors 110, Raptors 104, Raptors bets win since they lost by only 6 points. A 115-104 Warriors win would mean they covered the spread by 11 points.

Point spread odds in baseball

In a hypothetical MLB matchup between the Yankees and the Red Sox, the Yankees are set as -1.5 favorites on the ""run line"" (baseball’s point spread). Betting on the Yankees requires them to win by 2 or more runs.

For Red Sox bets to win, they must either secure a victory or lose by just 1 run. If the score ends Yankees 5, Red Sox 4, Red Sox bets win. Conversely, a 6-3 win for the Yankees covers the run line with a 3-run margin.

Point spread odds in hockey

At NHL betting sites, the ""puck line"" is akin to the point spread. In a game between the Canadiens and the Blackhawks, with the Canadiens as -1.5 favorites, they'd need to win by 2+ goals for their bettors to win.

Blackhawks bets win if they either triumph outright or lose by only one goal. If the score is Canadiens 3, Blackhawks 2, Blackhawks bets win since the Canadiens' one-goal victory doesn't cover the 1.5-goal spread. A 4-1 win for the Canadiens would mean they covered the spread by a 3-goal margin.

Point spread odds in soccer

In a hypothetical MLS game between LA Galaxy and Atlanta United, LA Galaxy is set as a -1 favorite on the goal line. They'd need to win by 2+ goals for bets on them to succeed. Atlanta United bets win if they either triumph outright or lose by a single goal.

With a score of LA Galaxy 2, Atlanta United 1, Atlanta bets win. However, a 3-1 win for LA Galaxy covers the spread with a 2-goal victory margin.

See more: Best soccer betting sites

Point spread odds in tennis

At tennis betting sites, point spread betting is usually based on games or sets, termed ""game handicap"" or ""set handicap."" In a match between Serena Williams and Maria Sharapova, if Williams is a -4.5 favorite, she must win by a 5-game margin for her bettors to win.

For example, a match score of 6-4, 6-2 for Williams gives a 6-game margin, covering the -4.5 spread. Betting on Sharapova at +4.5 wins if she wins outright or Williams wins by fewer than 5 games. Set handicaps work similarly but focus on the number of sets won by each player.

Point spread odds in golf

In golf betting, betting often centers on outright winners or head-to-head matchups. However, there's also ""stroke handicap"" betting, akin to point spreads but with golf strokes.

For example, in a head-to-head bet between Tiger Woods and Jordan Spieth, if Woods is given a -2.5 stroke handicap as the favorite, he'd need to outplay Spieth by 3 strokes or more to win the bet.

Betting on Spieth at +2.5 means he either wins outright or Woods wins by just 1 or 2 strokes.

Point spread betting FAQ

How does point spread betting work?

Point spread betting is a form of wagering where a sportsbook assigns a ""spread"" to level the playing field between two teams. One team, deemed the favorite, will have points deducted, while the other team, the underdog, will have points added.

The favorite must win by more than the spread to ""cover"" and be considered a winning bet, while the underdog must either win outright or lose by fewer points than the spread to be a winning bet.

What does the (-) in point spread betting mean?

The ""(-)"" symbol denotes the favorite and indicates by how many points the favorite must win to ""cover"" the spread.

What does the (+) in point spread betting mean?

The ""(+)"" symbol denotes the underdog and indicates the additional points given to that team for the purposes of the bet.

What happens to my point spread bet if there’s a tie?

If a point spread bet results in a tie, also known as a ""push,"" most sportsbooks will refund the amount wagered. This means neither the bettor nor the sportsbook wins or loses money on that particular bet. To avoid pushes, sportsbooks often use half-points (like 7.5 or 6.5) in their spreads.

Looking at this question a different way, if there’s a tie in the literal matchup, many spread bets should still have winners and losers. Say the Cleveland Browns are -1.5 favorites over the Baltimore Ravens, but this NFL matchup ends in a 21-21 tie after overtime. The Ravens would win that spread bet because the margin of victory (0) was narrower than 1.5.

NBA live betting

Thanks to the increased popularity of online sports betting apps, in-game betting has exploded nationwide. Also known as live betting, in-game betting allows you to bet on a game while it’s unfolding.

The action is fast, and the odds are constantly shifting, making for a new way to enjoy the flow of a game while still staying engaged as a bettor.

Depending on the sportsbook, there is usually a strong variety of live betting opportunities. You’ll find game and player prop bets like whether the next bucket will be worth one, two, or three points.

You can bet on the team leading at the end of the current quarter or on whether there will be a comeback victory. You can even boil live betting down to the results of the next possession.

The most popular sportsbook apps, such as DraftKings, FanDuel, and BetMGM, offer NBA in-game betting, though each has its lines and betting opportunities.

What makes NBA betting special or unique?

Basketball odds are known to fluctuate more than those of other sports. The factors that play into those lines shifting can range from having only a few impact players per team to the sheer frequency of games.

By following a single team, you can track its momentum swings, which players tend to get on hot or cold streaks, or how well they play at home vs. on the road. You can use that information to your advantage for both pre-game and live wagers.

Similar categories of moneylines, spreads, totals, and NBA prop bets should appear across both formats.

The NBA is also special because of the number of bets available for every game, ranging from pre-game to live betting and parlays.

When you add up the standard bets, game props, player props, in-game betting, and more, there’s a staggering volume of bets for every NBA game at online sportsbooks.

NBA spreads, money lines, and over/unders

For anyone new to NBA betting, the staple wager types are:

NBA point spreads: Bet on games via margins of victory or loss. Say the New York Knicks are -7.5 favorites over the Miami Heat. That means the Knicks need to win the game by 8 points to win a spread bet. On the other hand, the Heat can lose by up to 7 points (or win outright).

NBA moneylines: The simplest form of betting. You pick the winner of the game, and if you’re right, you’ll get paid out based on the odds when you finalize your bet slip. Favorites to win the game are shown negative odds, such as -135, while the underdogs will have positive odds, like +165.

NBA over/under bets: Also known as totals. These bets are focused on the combined point total of the two teams playing in a game. (Winners and losers don’t matter.) For example, the over/under could be set at 211.5 points in the Knicks vs. Heat matchup. If you were to pick the over on the bet, you’d need the two teams to combine for 212 points or more to win. They need to score 211 points or fewer if you went with the under.

NBA props and futures

NBA player and team props are growing in popularity. Sportsbooks are taking note and providing more NBA props than ever.

After all, it’s much easier to focus on a single player and how he will perform than the entire team. Player props could focus on how many points a player scores or how many rebounds he pulls down. These are typically provided in an over/under format.

Then, team props can range from which team will score the first bucket to the total points scored in a quarter to which team will lead at halftime. The selection is often robust, especially when high-profile teams play.

and much more. You can usually bet on NBA futures odds throughout the year, including well before the season starts and throughout the regular season. The further away from the event, the more likely you will find heavier odds in your favor.

Is NBA betting legal in the U.S.?

In the US, the landscape of sports betting, specifically NBA betting, has evolved considerably. While NBA betting is permitted, its legality varies across the nation. The significant turning point came in 2018 when the US Supreme Court made a pivotal decision. It overturned a longstanding federal law and allowed individual states the autonomy to determine their own sports betting regulations.

This groundbreaking decision sparked a wave of change. Since that landmark ruling, over 30 states have embraced sports betting, including wagers on the NBA. For those residing or visiting betting-friendly states, the experience promises fairness and security.

State-regulated online betting platforms are in place, ensuring that bettors receive fair odds. Furthermore, these platforms adhere to strict standards, ensuring a safe and transparent betting environment for everyone involved.

sports,Simon Burnton at the Brian Lara Stadium,2023-12-21T23:45:58+00:00,"What a difference two days make. Somehow Tuesday’s ludicrous, record-smashing, high-scoring entertainment was followed by a sequel on the same surface that eventually delivered thrilling low-scoring entertainment, and a different result claimed in very different style. It was eventually won for West Indies with four balls to spare and in the most unfitting of ways – with a massive six – by Shai Hope, again proving himself the right man for a run-chase.

So a series marked by stunning power hitting, roaring run rates and an unexpected midway transformation in England’s performances and prospects concluded with a 3-2 triumph for West Indies, who extended their supremacy over England at home to four series in three formats across nearly five years.

England assembled exactly the same players in exactly the same place and exactly the same situation – losing the toss, put in to bat – but this was an entirely different performance. A wicket once so true turned untrustworthy and they struggled to a score of 132, less than half the 267 to which they had joyously motored just 48 hours previously. And though the home side’s response was anything but overwhelming, neither was the result ever in significant doubt.

“We’ve had some high-scoring games, but the last game was almost the complete opposite of what happened here,” Reece Topley said. “We were probably just under par with the first-innings score but with the ball we were excellent, pushed them right to the end. I think it’s been an amazing series. Both teams have played some unbelievable cricket. I was so excited turning up today, because it was basically a final and those are the games you want to play in and be on the right side of. The bottom line is you want to win this series, I want to win every series I can for England.”

Often there is a sense as a tour enters its final days of thoughts turning to home, and perhaps the focus was not as laser-sharp as it might have been for this game, determination less than absolute to grasp this opportunity to end England’s run of reverses in the Caribbean. Whatever the reason, the pyrotechnics that rocketed England to victory in the two previous matches never sparked in this one. It took a fabulous delivery from Gudakesh Motie to end Phil Salt’s run of absurd form with his score a modest 38, but some of the other wickets that fell during the period that defined England’s innings and the game seemed a little careless.

In the fourth over Jos Buttler casually turned a Jason Holder delivery to fine leg, where Oshane Thomas was positioned, hands cupped. Harry Brook tried to paddle-sweep Motie but sent the ball only a few feet into the air, giving Nicholas Pooran an easy catch. That made it 70 for four and the game was one ball into its ninth over, at which point Liam Livingstone and Moeen Ali had to focus for a while on disaster prevention rather than entertainment.

Suddenly bowlers were energised by the prospect of posting, for a change, less-than-humiliating figures. Akeal Hosein’s were outstanding, his four overs going for just 20 and bringing the wickets of Will Jacks and Moeen, undone by a relay catch on the boundary after combining with Livingstone to add 40 for the fifth wicket. Livingstone followed precisely two overs later, prodding the ball limply back into the hands of Motie, at which point things really fell apart, the last five wickets surrendered in 20 balls for just 11 runs.

Just as surely as when they came out on Tuesday facing an almost unachievable task, the outcome of the West Indies’ run chase seemed inevitable from the start. With such a meagre target they needed little more than to keep their heads, and though both Topley and Sam Curran conceded only two with their final overs to push the contest into its final over, that never looked in doubt.

Halfway through their innings they were 62 for three, and if England had 15 more runs at the same point they had also made a complete hash of the rest of it. That was a trap which, thanks to Hope’s 43-ball 43 as he again steered his side to their target, West Indies avoided. This batting display may have lacked their usual flamboyance but until the final ball it was entirely appropriate for the occasion.

Amid the wider theme of transformation Adil Rashid’s excellence remains constant. The 35-year-old, who rose to the top of the T20 bowling rankings for the first time on Wednesday, took two wickets and conceded just 21 while Topley was even better, also claiming a pair of victims but conceding only 17. England take plenty of positives from this series, but the result was not one.",West Indies clinch T20 series after Shai Hope edges hosts past England total,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/dec/21/west-indies-clinch-t20-series-after-shai-hope-edges-hosts-past-england-total,The Guardian
sports,News,2023-12-24T22:28:25+00:00,"Alyssa Healy has rejected any suggestion Australia’s stranglehold on international women’s cricket is slipping, saying their Test loss to India is barely a blip on the team’s record.

Australia stumbled to their first Test defeat to India by eight wickets in Mumbai on Sunday, after being outplayed by the hosts in foreign spinning conditions.

The loss comes after one of the more difficult periods for the Australian side in the past six years, with the retirements of Meg Lanning and Rachael Haynes.

Facebook Twitter Whatsapp Reddit Email Share

After winning their fourth straight global ICC event earlier this year in the 50-over World Cup, Australia retained the Ashes via a drawn multi-format series in England in July.

That tour included losing four of six white-ball matches, with Australia’s win in the Test enough to have them level on points with England and hold onto the trophy.

The current tour of India is not a multi-format series, but the defeat in the one-off Test marks Australia’s first loss in a four-day game since January 2014.

But quizzed over whether the defeat suggested Australia’s unprecedented period of dominance was ending, Healy was defiant.

“It’s probably not even a blip,” Healy said.

“It (Test cricket) is a format where we’re not overly familiar with, in conditions that we’re not familiar with.

“I see more positives out of this and than any sort of negativity.

“There is always a lot of expectation and external noise about our team and how we’re performing.

“They are so used to seeing us winning, that I think, at times, they forget that we’ve actually seen quite a lot of change over the last 12 to 18 months.

“That kind of goes unnoticed external to our group.”

Australia have spoken about shifting their mindset in white-ball cricket after the losses in England, pursuing a more attacking approach.

Three looming ODIs against India in the next week and three ensuing T20s will be the first showing of that, with the hosts also a rising force in the white-ball game.

“Within our group we’re really comfortable with where we’re at, and the progression we’re on,” Healy said.

“Ultimately there’s a big T20 World Cup in Bangladesh towards the end of next year, that is a real carrot for us.

“These are the sort of big trophies that we’re wanting to win.

“And yes, every series in between now and then is important, but at the same time we’re building towards that World Cup.

“Maybe you can ask me that (supremacy) question at the end of the six white-ball games to see how we’re going and we can answer that.

“These next six games will probably give us a better indication about how we’re tracking but also what we might need to improve on.”

Healy called for Australia’s Test series in India to be extended to three matches their loss, their first in 11 Tests against India.

The hosts easily chased down 75 in the fourth innings on Sunday.

All out for 209 in their first innings, Australia looked far more confident in their second effort of 261 despite the wicket showing more signs of wear.

And Healy believes three-Test tours of India would provide a better match-up between the two sides.

“It would create a real contest over three games,” Healy said.

“That would be an unbelievable experience for our group, and probably a true test of of both sides’ abilities.

“The one-off Test, India playing in their home conditions, you’d expect them to be heavy favourites.

“But the way we tried to adapt and continue to learn throughout the four days was really impressive.

“We would love to have another crack at it, show what we learned and put it into practice.”

Healy is realistic in conceding her wish is unlikely to be granted.

The last women’s Test series of more than one match was way back in 2006, while India had not hosted any red-ball cricket for nine years before this summer.

“The nature of the female game at the moment is it’s very white-ball dominant,” Healy said.

“Trying to fit it all in to the calendar and fitting all the white-ball games in seems to take precedence.

Advertisement

“But you take three one-day games out, and we could probably play two more Test matches.”

Australia’s captain is also insistent this Test should have formed part of a multi-format series, in the same way most top-tier women’s tours are now conducted.

While one Test, three ODIs and three T20s will be played, each are individual contests rather than an overarching series in the same way the Ashes is decided.

Australia had taken the trophy used from the multi-format 2021-22 series against India to be contested, only to be told by authorities that system would not be used.

“I sit here disappointed that we couldn’t win the Test match,” Healy said.

“But at the end of the day, we weren’t necessarily playing for points, we weren’t playing for overall series points for a trophy.

“It does make it a little bit of a novelty in a sense.

“The fact that it sort of feels meaningless to a sense is really disappointing to me. But in saying that we are disappointed that we couldn’t get ourselves over the line.”

sports,"Wes Goldberg, RealGM",2023-11-29T20:41:32+00:00,"In June of 2021, Jonathan Kuminga and Moses Moody sat on a stage on the Chase Center court, with then-GM Bob Myers to their left, as the Warriors introduced their newest first-round draft picks.

“We’re excited,” Myers said. “I talk about the character first because that’s what’s going to make that A-grade stick or not. It’s gonna be on what they do from here on out, not what they've done so far.”

It’s true that the Warriors received glowing grades from draft analysts following their selections of Kuminga, out of the G-League Ignite program, at No. 7, and Arkansas’ Moody at No. 14. Unfortunately for them, that A-grade has not stuck.

Fast-forward more than two years and both players are struggling to make the sort of impact the Warriors had hoped when they flaunted their two-timeline plan. Kuminga, though he’s had flashes and is only 21, is almost as raw as he was as an 18-year-old. He plays nearly 20 minutes per game for a thin Warriors team, but his shooting percentages (43.8% overall, 19.4% on 3s) have dipped to career lows. Moody has been the more stable of the two. He’s a reliable catch-and-shoot threat (38.2% shooting from 3) and earnest defender but doesn’t do much outside the limits of his job description.

The Warriors are 8-10 following Tuesday’s disastrous collapse to the Kings in Sacramento. Leading by five with 58 seconds to go and a spot in the next round of the In-Season Tournament on the line, Andrew Wiggins fouled De’Aaron Fox, Stephen Curry passed the ball straight to Malik Monk on his own side of the court, Draymond Green threw the ball out of bounds and Monk scored five points in the final 37 seconds to send the Warriors back to San Francisco forced to ask some tough questions.

On the floor for these minutes were Curry, Klay Thompson, Green, Wiggins and Kevon Looney. Four of the five were drafted by the Warriors. Steph, Klay and Draymond are the bedrock of four championship teams and perhaps the NBA’s greatest dynasty this century.

But a franchise built through the draft has had very little success selecting players over the past decade.

If the Warriors seem old, it’s because they are. Curry (35) can still play at an MVP level, but Green (33) and Thompson (33) are not the players they were during Golden State’s run to five straight Finals.

Green (when he isn’t suspended) can still uncork vintage defensive performances, but his offensive game has not aged well as the league trends toward more shooting. The typically affable Thompson, having suffered two major leg injuries since 2019, is bristling at questions about the starting lineup. The Warriors’ starting five – a dominant unit over the last decade – is being outscored by an alarming 10.6 points every 100 possessions this season.

The Warriors have had a hard time reinventing themselves. The two-timeline approach was supposed to infuse the team with youth and athleticism. Instead, Kuminga and Moody can’t crack the rotation some nights, and 2020’s No. 2 overall pick James Wiseman now plays in Detroit.

If anything, the Warriors got older. Over the last nine months, they traded 24-year-old Jordan Poole to the Wizards in a deal that netted 38-year-old Chris Paul, unloaded Wiseman to bring back 30-year-old Gary Payton II and signed 29-year-old Dario Saric to help anchor the second unit. Behind the Bucks and Clippers, the Warriors are the league’s third-oldest team.

It’s easy to point to the 2020 and 2021 drafts as the problem. The Warriors – during a two-year, injury-riddled drought that separated Finals runs – in 2021 selected Kuminga one pick ahead of Franz Wagner and Moody over Alperen Sengun and Trey Murphy III. The year before, they drafted Wiseman over LaMelo Ball and Tyrese Haliburton.

(At the risk of saying I told you so, a certain Warriors beat reporter at the time argued for the better picks here and here. There was something to be said of drafting the more NBA-ready players, even at the risk of missing out on Wiseman’s and Kuminga’s ceilings.)

But Golden State’s original sins run deeper than that. Here’s a look at their recent draft history.

Looney, picked in 2015 (when “Uptown Funk” and “Trap Queen” were topping music charts) is the only indisputable success. Beyond that, Poole is the only other draft pick to have signed another contract with the Warriors beyond his rookie deal.

Poole, at 28, helped power the Warriors to the 2022 championship but was in equal amounts part of the problem the next season. (And based on his season in Washington, his 2022 playoff run is looking more and more like an outlier.)

Four draft picks are now on other teams: Patrick Baldwin, Wiseman, Poole and Damian Jones; and four are no longer in the league: Nico Mannion, Justinian Jessup, Eric Paschall, Jacob Evans.

June’s 19th overall pick Brandin Podziemski seems like a base hit right now, but it’s been a month. Do I need to remind you of the brief flashes we saw from Paschall?

To be fair, it’s hard to nail the draft when you’re always selecting at 28 and 30. But using three lottery picks and coming away with maybe one fringe rotation player would doom any franchise that doesn’t have Steph Curry.

For years, these picks and players have been a luxury for the Warriors, but the age problem is coming to a head. Thompson will be a free agent in seven months, Paul’s contract for next season is not guaranteed and Green’s new contract, though a bargain now, might not look as great when he’s 37 years old.

Maximizing what’s left of Curry’s championship window will prompt some tough decisions. The Warriors might have to cut bait on the two remaining lottery picks who shared a stage two years ago, Kuminga and Moody. Either one could have value as a “second draft” candidate for a younger team. For instance, Kuminga’s $6 million salary can be added to Payton to build $14.7 million in outgoing salary. Moody’s $3.9 million is some sugar to sweeten a deal for any of Golden State’s higher-priced players.

Available big names like Zach LaVine might not make a ton of sense given his age and contract, but everything from All-Star acquisitions to trading for helpful role players should be on the table. If the Warriors decide to reorient the roster around Curry between now and February’s trade deadline, new GM Mike Dunleavy Jr. would be tasked with rebuilding a jet mid-flight.

Whether it’s before the trade deadline or next summer, it feels like something is bound to change in Golden State. The draft picks haven’t panned out and Curry’s supporting cast is showing its age, but finding solutions in the middle is easier said than done.",Golden State's draft misses are starting to add up,https://www.yardbarker.com/nba/articles/golden_states_draft_misses_are_starting_to_add_up/s1_8276_39602204,Yardbarker
sports,Mike Meehall Wood,2023-12-07T22:28:31+00:00,"Spurs have fallen to their fourth defeat in five with a 2-1 reverse at home to West Ham – and they only have themselves to blame.

Ange Postecoglou’s men were sitting pretty at 1-0 up thanks to an early Cristian Romero header, then missed a host of chances to extend their lead against a Hammers side who couldn’t get out of their own end.

Yet after spurning their own opportunities, Tottenham presented two gift-wrapped chances to their opponents.

Facebook Twitter Whatsapp Reddit Email Share

Their defence was nowhere to be seen as Mohammed Kudus was able to shoot, with his effort deflecting off two Spurs players and into the path of Jarrod Bowen to level the scores.

Then Destiny Udogie’s blind backpass allowed James Ward-Prowse an easy shot on goal, and while he hit the post, the rebound fell perfectly for the midfielder to finish on the rebound.

“It’s unacceptable,” said captain Heung-Min Son.

“I think players should take responsibility, this is unacceptable.

“The fans don’t deserve this, especially when you play at home, when you go 1-0 up early on you should play with even more energy but we didn’t, and that’s why we lost.

“West Ham have always been tough to play against so we knew what was coming.

“But we were soft, and especially in the Premier League, even when you’re winning 2-0, 3-0, you don’t know what’s going to happen in the end. 1-0 is not enough, you have to try to kill the game.”

The coach wasn’t quite as damning, but still described the showing as poor.

“It’s another game where we’ve dominated a game of football but we haven’t taken advantage,” said Postecoglou.

“I thought we were poor in both areas with our finishing and also both goals we conceded were terrible.

There’s no point in feeling sorry for ourselves, looking for a cuddle anywhere. There’s only one way to change our circumstances and that is to come here on Sunday and put in a performance, not just play good football but go out there and show some conviction about ourselves as a team.

“Sometimes we can disguise how we’re going by playing some nice stuff but like I said from day one, that’s not what I’m about.

“I want to win and that’s why I came to this football club and that’s the message. We’ve still got a long way to go, I’ve said that from the start, we’re still right at the beginning what we need to create and days like today just give me further evidence and fuel of how much we need to do.”

On Optus Sport, ex-Spurs boss Tim Sherwood tore strips off Spurs.

“They’re quietly having a bad run, it’s five without a win now,” he said.

“They’ve led in every game and I’ve said when they take the lead, I wouldn’t say the game is over. It’s not good enough.

“But they’ve changed. The last three or four years they’ve been watching some dross there but it’s better to watch. It’s game management.

“They go ahead and they’re already winning the game but they try and win it again and again and leave themselves open. Jarrod Bowen was outstanding out there and you can really exploit them. They leave space and they make poor decisions on the ball and it’s costing them at the moment.”

Spurs had rebounded from three consecutive defeats with a stirring 3-3 draw at Manchester City over the weekend, but are now outside the Champions League qualification spots in fifth place – and level with Manchester United.

West Ham aren’t far behind, with this result lifting them to ninth, just three points back from Spurs.

“Huge performance because of the quality of the opposition,” said coach David Moyes.

“We were up against it tonight. We had to dig in. Thankfully we just about scraped it.

“The quality Tottenham showed in the first half, I don’t know if we touched the ball for eight or nine minutes.

“We gained a bit of confidence once we got some passes. We wanted to get after them a bit more but by the same breath we were cautious about them picking us off.

In the other match, Everton trounced Newcastle 3-0 to move clear of the relegation zone despite their ten point penalty for financial irregularities.

They left it late, with goals from Dwight McNeil, Abdoulaye Doucoure and Brazilian striker Beto enough to down the Magpies.

“Without those 10 points, we’d be in an amazing position,” said Toffees boss Sean Dyche. “20 points would be amazing relatively to the last two seasons here.

“We’ll see what the appeal brings. The mentality is key for me, we took a knock but there have been a lot of knocks here over the last couple of years.

“But the team mentality is growing. I can’t emphasise it enough, the commitment to each other and the connection is a powerful thing because I know we’ve got quality.”

In the last month, they have defeated Manchester United, Arsenal and Chelsea – as well as drawing at French heavyweights PSG in the Champions League – but have now lost comfortably to two cellar dwellers in Everton and Bournemouth.

“We have to do better,” said Howe.

“There are reasons behind every performance and we have struggled to change players. That is a big miss with the quality of players out. The longer you do it, the harder it gets. I am disappointed, a missed opportunity, we did not grab it.

“The game was there for us to win in the second half. The first half was even and we had them penned in in the second half. We conceded the first goal and it changed the momentum of the match.

sports,Sloan Piva,2023-12-13T20:32:00+00:00,"It's somehow already mid-December, meaning millions of fantasy football owners just reached their respective ""offseason."" Luckily for those who missed the playoffs, there's Week 15 DFS. We hold the key to consistent daily fantasy success: pinpointing and playing the cheapest sleepers and highest-ceiling value plays each week.

Every Tuesday, we scour DraftKings, FanDuel, and SuperDraft for affordable sleepers and under-the-radar value plays that will set you apart from the DFS pack. By finding stud production at modest prices, we allow ourselves plenty of remaining budget to afford elite weekly performers at other roster spots. When our studs and our sleepers hit, we usually win.

We do all the leg work for you -- poring over the player pools, like my daughter searching the Target Christmas catalog — then we handpick the most promising sleepers and tell you why they're worth drafting to your next DFS squad. All you have to do is choose your favorites, sit back, and relax.

WEEK 15 FANTASY ADVICE:

Sleepers | Busts | Projections | Start-sit

If daily fantasy was as easy as picking all top-end skill-position players from one week to the next, it would be a lot easier to win the milli-maker. Let's face it, in order to win big, we need to hit on some diamonds in the rough, and in order to afford a CeeDee Lamb ($9,200 on DK), we have to invest in the occasional Demarcus Robinson ($3,600).

We have enjoyed consistent success with our DFS sleepers and values all season. Each Tuesday, we share a big list of our hits from the previous week. — with each hit typically netting at least 16-22 fantasy points. Throughout the year, we've been consistently ahead of the game on breakouts like Puka Nacua, Kyren Williams, and Tank Dell, among many others.

Take a look at our collection of hits from last week:

Pos. Player Wk. 14 Game DK Price Pts QB Baker Mayfield Buccaneers at Falcons $5,300 20.1 QB Russell Wilson Broncos at Chargers $5,800 19.5 QB Gardner Minshew Colts at Bengals $5,400 16.1 RB Joe Mixon Bengals vs. Colts $6,100 21.5 RB Javonte Williams Broncos at Chargers $5,800 18.1 WR Garrett Wilson Jets vs. Texans $5,500 23.1 WR Rashee Rice Chiefs vs. Bills $5,400 19.2 WR Courtland Sutton Broncos at Chargers $6,100 15.2 TE Isaiah Likely Ravens vs. Rams $3,500 19.3 DST Cleveland Browns vs. Jaguars $3,000 12.0

Now that's what we call a strong week! We averaged over 19 DK points per position player and 18.4 per position while spending just under $5,200 per pick. Rostering that kind of cheap production allowed us to find consistent weekly studs at other positions while setting us apart from the pack through lineup variance.

Let's shower, rinse, repeat! This year, we're also incorporating SuperDraft into our weekly DFS column. For those unfamiliar, SuperDraft's DFS scoring involves point multipliers as opposed to traditional salary-capped or tiered contests. A winning lineup will likely feature a strong mix of stud fantasy contributors with 1x-1.6x boosts, as well as matchup-based sleepers with larger multipliers. Each player is assigned a scoring multiplier based on their value as determined by SuperDraft. So, the sleepers who carry lower salaries in DK/FD have higher boosts on SD. The best part: SuperDraft users can roster any player with no restrictions.

MORE SUPERDRAFT DFS: How to play SuperDraft

Now, to our picks. Below we will reveal our Week 15 DFS sleepers and values at each position. Good luck, have fun, and enjoy what will undoubtedly be another wild week!

All player values are from DraftKings, FanDuel, and SuperDraft. All stats are from NFL.com and Pro Football Reference.

NFL DFS Picks Week 15: QB sleepers, values for DraftKings, FanDuel, SuperDraft

Brock Purdy, 49ers at Cardinals (DK: $6,800 | FD: $8,400 | SD: 1.2x)

We usually don't feature players with salaries higher than $6,200 on DK and $8,000 on FD, but $6,800 on DK just seems like a massive value for the MVP frontrunner. Purdy has been scorching, with 57.9 DK points over San Francisco's past two games and at least 23.8 in five of the Niners' past six. The Cards rank among the 10 most generous defenses to QBs on DK, so we're all over the young gunslinger in the desert this weekend.

Jordan Love, Packers vs. Buccaneers (DK: $6,200 | FD: $8,000 | SD: 1.25x)

Love and the Packers' pass-catchers have emerged as legit offensive threats over the past month, finally easing the Cheeseheads' anguish over the departure of Aaron Rodgers. Cult hero Tommy DeVito hit the pause button on Green Bay's good times, but it should start rolling again this weekend at home against a miserable Tampa Bay secondary. The Bucs have surrendered the fourth-most FD points and fifth-most DK points to QBs this season, and Plodmaster General AJ Dillon ain't about to crack their strong front-seven. We love Love this weekend, and not just because we're lovers at heart.

Other solid Week 15 values: Matthew Stafford, Rams vs. Commanders (DK: $6,000 | FD: $7,200 | SD: 1.3x); Derek Carr, Saints vs. Giants (DK: $5,800 | FD: $6,500 | SD: 1.35x); Joe Flacco, Browns vs. Bears (DK: $5,500 | FD: $7,100 | SD: 1.35x); Will Levis, Titans vs. Texans (DK: $5,400 | FD: $6,800 | SD: 1.35x)

WEEK 15 STANDARD RANKINGS:

NFL DFS Picks Week 15: RB sleepers, values for DraftKings, FanDuel, SuperDraft

Devin Singletary, Texans at Titans (DK: $5,400 | FD: $6,000 | SD: 1.35x)

With C.J. Stroud in the league's concussion protocol and Nico Collins (calf) joining Tank Dell (fibula) on the Texans' injury list, Houston suddenly finds itself without many impact skill-position players. Singletary, however, has been pretty damn good and showed us last week that he's the main man over Dameon Pierce in DeMeco Ryans' backfield. He had 13 carries for 65 yards and a TD against the Jets, while Pierce totaled just five touches for seven yards. Don't be scared of Tennessee's run D because it ain't what it used to be under Mike Vrabel. Raheem Mostert and De'Von Achane just posted 35.1 PPR points against the Titans, Chuba Hubbard had 20.2 a few weeks ago, and Rachaad White had 17.8 against them in Week 10.

Antonio Gibson, Commanders at Rams (DK: $5,200 | FD: $5,600 | SD: 1.4x)

Aaron Donald and friends will be attacking the pocket early and often in pursuit of Sam Howell, who has been sacked 10 more times than any other QB. Dump-offs and screens will be plentiful for Gibson, who comes at a major discount, at least in PPR formats.

More solid Week 15 RB values: Ezekiel Elliott, Patriots vs. Chiefs (DK: $5,800 | FD: $6,500 | SD: 1.35x); Jerick McKinnon, Chiefs at Patriots (DK: $5,100 | FD: $5,500 | SD: 1.45x); Jordan Mason, 49ers at Cardinals (DK: $4,600 | FD: $4,200 | SD: 1.6x); Tyler Allgeier, Falcons at Panthers (DK: $4,400 | FD: $5,700 | SD: 1.6x)

WEEK 15 PPR RANKINGS:

QBs | RBs | WRs | TEs | D/STs | Kickers

NFL DFS Picks Week 15: WR sleepers, values for DraftKings, FanDuel, SuperDraft

Rashee Rice, Chiefs at Patriots (DK: $6,100 | FD: $6,500 | SD: 1.35x)

With Isiah Pacheco (shoulder) banged up, Rice seems like Kansas City's best skill-position player this side of Travis Kelce. He's certainly the most sure-handed wideout on the Chiefs (not saying much, but still), and he has electric after-the-catch playmaking ability (which is good, considering Patrick Mahomes has struggled with deep-ball accuracy). The rookie has quietly posted 57.3 PPR points over the past three weeks! Since Bill Belichick's defense typically makes it a point to neutralize the opposition's top threat, which is obviously Kelce this weekend, look for Rice to bust some chunk-yard plays through the screen game and dump-downs.

Romeo Doubs, Packers vs. Buccaneers (DK: $5,300 | FD: $6,400 | SD: 1.45x)

Doubs has been one of the more dependable offensive weapons in Green Bay's offense, and Tampa Bay's secondary has been utterly abysmal all season, so we're rolling with the young wideout in a handful of lineups this weekend. Doubs has a good floor, logging 11-plus DK points eight times, and a decent ceiling (at least 18.3 three times). Fire him up in what should be a pass-heavy matchup at Lambeau.

Demarcus Robinson, Rams vs. Commanders (DK: $3,600 | FD: $5,600 | SD: 1.7x)

Robinson has become one of Matthew Stafford's most trusted receivers, drawing a 21.8-percent target share over the past two weeks. And the veteran has made the most of his opportunities, collecting seven catches for 101 yards and two TDs during that span. The Commanders are terrible at defending the pass — even worse than they were earlier in the season since they shipped out multiple impact pass-rushers. Washington has surrendered the most FanDuel points and second-most DraftKings points to wide receivers this season. Run DMC into your DFS lineups this weekend.

More solid Week 15 WR values: Amari Cooper, Browns vs. Bears (DK: $6,000 | FD: $7,200 | SD: 1.35x); Garrett Wilson, Jets at Dolphins (DK: $5,800 | FD: $6,900 | SD: 1.4x); Brandin Cooks, Cowboys at Bills (DK: $5,200 | FD: $6,300 | SD: 1.45x); A.T. Perry, Saints vs. Giants (DK: $3,500 | FD: $4,700 | SD: 1.7x)

WEEK 15 DFS:

NFL DFS Picks Week 15: TE sleepers, values for DraftKings, FanDuel, SuperDraft

David Njoku, Browns vs. Bears (DK: $4,700 | FD: $6,200 | SD: 1.3x)

Njoku went nuclear last weekend, catching six of his eight targets from Joe Flacco for 91 yards and two touchdowns. Now he gets a chance for an encore against the Bears, who have surrendered the 10th-most PPR points to tight ends this season. No joke, dude — you can trust Njoku!

More solid Week 15 TE values: Logan Thomas, Commanders at Rams (DK: $3,700 | FD: $5,100 | SD: 1.5x); Cade Otton, Buccaneers at Packers (DK: $3,200 | FD: $5,200 | SD: 1.65x); Tucker Kraft, Packers vs. Buccaneers (DK: $3,000 | FD: $4,700 | SD: 1.8x)

NFL DFS Picks Week 15: D/ST sleepers, values for DraftKings, FanDuel

Los Angeles Rams vs. Commanders (DK: $3,100 | FD: $4,300)

The Rams got destroyed by MVP candidate Lamar Jackson and the high-flying Ravens in Week 14, but push that out of your memory banks. Before that game, Sean McVay's squad had surrendered 20 or fewer points in four straight contests. Aaron Donald and company also have 17 sacks and six takeaways over their past six games, so they'll be licking their chops looking across the line at Sam Howell this weekend. No QB has more interceptions than Howell, who has also taken 10 more sacks than any other signal-caller this season.

More solid Week 15 D/ST plays: Chicago Bears at Browns (DK: $3,300 | FD: $4,100); New York Jets at Dolphins (DK: $2,700 | FD: $3,600); New England Patriots vs. Chiefs (DK: $2,300 | FD: $3,200)","NFL DFS picks Week 15: Best sleepers, value players for FanDuel, DraftKings, SuperDraft lineups",https://www.sportingnews.com/us/fantasy/news/dfs-picks-week-15-draftkings-fanduel-sleepers-value-lineup/49b050404a7a45697029c296,Sporting News
